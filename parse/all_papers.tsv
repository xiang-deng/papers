Although existing fine-tuning approaches substantially improve accuracy in-distribution, they also reduce out-of-distribution robustness. We address this tension by introducing a simple and effective method for improving robustness: ensembling the weights of the zero-shot and fine-tuned models. Compared to Cites: Wilds: A benchmark of in-the-wild distribution shifts"

However, while pretraining methods are very convenient, they are expensive in terms of time and resources. This calls for a study of the impact of pretraining data size on the knowledge of the models. We explore this impact on the syntactic capabilities of RoBERTa, using models trained on incremental sizes of raw text data. First, we use syntactic structural probes to Cites: Designing and interpreting probes with control tasks"

The most prominent defense is adversarial training, a method for learning a robust model. Nevertheless, adversarial training does not make DNNs immune to adversarial perturbations. We propose a novel solution by adopting the recently suggested Predictive Normalized Maximum Likelihood. Specifically, our defense performs adversarial targeted attacks according Cites: Unlabeled data improves adversarial robustness"

While this task was previously rendered through expensive and time-consuming human labor, we present this novel task of automatic naturalness evaluation of generated language.

Previous work (eg, KnowBERT) has focused on the integrating entity knowledge from knowledge graphs. In order to introduce the external entity embeddings, they learn to jointly represent the original sentences and external knowledge by pre-training on a large scale corpus. However, when switching to textual commonsense, unlike the light entity embeddings, the encoding of Cites: Expbert: Representation engineering with natural language"

This lack of interpretability (1) inhibits adoption within safety critical applications,(2) makes it challenging to debug existing models, and (3) prevents us from extracting valuable knowledge. Explainable AI (XAI) research aims to increase the transparency of DNN model behaviour to improve interpretability.
