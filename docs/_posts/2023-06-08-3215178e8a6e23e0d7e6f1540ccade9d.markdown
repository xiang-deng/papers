Structured databases on flash flood (FF) events have limited information and lack emerging data (eg, visual media). The web is rich with information that can bridge this gap. However, search engines return long lists of webpages cluttered with commercial and irrelevant information. To address this challenge, we developed a FF information retrieval (IR) system (FF-IR). The system uses machine learning (ML) models in novel ways to automate and enhance this IR process. FF-IR consists of Cites: COVID-19 information retrieval with deep-learning based semantic
