Even when a black-box model makes accurate predictions (eg, whether it will rain tomorrow), it is difficult to extract principles from the model that improve human understanding (eg, what set of atmospheric conditions best predict rainfall). The field of model explainability approaches this problem by identifying salient aspects of the model, such as data features to which the model is most sensitive. However, these methods can be unstable and inconsistent, leading to unreliable insights  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
