Researchers have recently introduced neural memory recommender networks (NMRNs) to handle sparse data and capture users dynamic interests better, which usually appear in e-commerce platforms. However, NMRNs update their memory with only the last interacted item, and this interaction-wise memory updating approach makes them too sensitive to some  Cites: Ask me anything: Dynamic memory networks for natural language
