The ability to understand and generate languages sets human cognition apart from other known life forms . We study a way of combing two of the most successful routes to meaning of language--statistical language models and symbolic semantics formalisms--in the task of semantic parsing. Building on a transition-based, Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parser, AmrEager, we explore the utility of incorporating pretrained context-aware word embeddings--such as BERT and …
