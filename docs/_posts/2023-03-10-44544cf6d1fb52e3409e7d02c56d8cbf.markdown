This work proposes codebook encodings for graph networks that operate on hyperbolic manifolds. Where graph networks commonly learn node representations in Euclidean space, recent work has provided a generalization to Riemannian manifolds, with a particular focus on the hyperbolic space. Expressive node representations are obtained by repeatedly performing a logarithmic map, followed by message passing in the tangent space and an exponential map back to the …
