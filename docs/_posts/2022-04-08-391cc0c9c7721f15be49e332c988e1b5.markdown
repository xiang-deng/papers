Tensor ring (TR) decomposition is a highly effective tool for obtaining the low-rank character of multi-way data. Recently, nonnegative tensor ring (NTR) decomposition combined with manifold learning has emerged as a promising approach for exploiting the multi-dimensional structure and extracting features from tensor data. However, an existing method such as graph regularized tensor ring (GNTR) decomposition only models the pair-wise similarities of objects.
