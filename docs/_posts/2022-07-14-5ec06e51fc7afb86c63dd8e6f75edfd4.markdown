Analogies are 4-ary relations of the form A is to B as C is to D . While focus has been mostly on how to solve an analogy, ie how to find correct values of D given A, B and C, less attention has been drawn on whether solving such an analogy was actually feasible. In this paper, we propose a quantification of the transferability of a source case (A and B) to solve a target problem C. This quantification is based on a complexity minimization principle which has been demonstrated to be efficient for  Cites: Linguistic regularities in continuous space word representations
