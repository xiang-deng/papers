Database Management Systems (DBMSs) process a given query by creating an execution plan, which is subsequently executed, to compute the query s result. Deriving an efficient query plan is challenging, and both academia and industry have invested decades into researching query optimization. Despite this, DBMSs are prone to performance issues, where a DBMS produces an inefficient query plan that might lead to the slow execution of a query. Finding such issues is a longstanding …
