Machine-generated text may displace human-written text on the internet and has the potential to be used for malicious purposes, such as spearphishing attacks and social media bots. Watermarking is a simple and effective strategy for mitigating such harms by enabling the detection and documentation of LLM-generated text. Yet, a crucial  Cites: Paraphrasing evades detectors of ai-generated text, but retrieval is
