Self-supervised learning techniques are celebrating immense success in natural language processing (NLP) by enabling models to learn from broad language data at unprecedented scales. Here, we aim to leverage the success of these techniques for mental state decoding, where researchers aim to identify specific mental states (such as an individual s experience of anger or happiness) from brain activity. To this end, we devise a set of novel self-supervised learning frameworks for neuroimaging  Cites: Well-Read Students Learn Better: On the Importance of Pre
