Counterfactually Augmented Data (CAD) aims to improve out-of-domain generalizability, an indicator of model robustness. The improvement is credited with promoting core features of the construct over spurious artifacts that happen to correlate with it. Yet, over-relying on core features may lead to unintended model bias. Especially, construct-driven CAD--perturbations of core features--may induce models to ignore the context in which core features are used. Here, we test models Cites: Polyjuice: Generating counterfactuals for explaining, evaluating
