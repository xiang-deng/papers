We propose a new method for learning a generalized animatable neural human representation from a sparse set of multi-view imagery of multiple persons. The learned representation can be used to synthesize novel view images of an arbitrary person from a sparse set of cameras, and further animate them with the user s pose control. While existing methods can either generalize to new persons or synthesize animations with user control, none of them can achieve both at the same time.
