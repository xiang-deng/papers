Relation extraction is a core problem for natural language processing in the biomedical domain. Recent research on relation extraction showed that prompt- based learning improves the performance on both fine-tuning on full training set and few-shot training. However, less effort has been made on domain-specific tasks where good prompt design can be even harder. In this paper, we investigate prompting for biomedical relation extraction, with experiments on the ChemProt Cites: Language models as knowledge bases?
