Object picking in cluttered scenes is a widely investigated field of robot manipulation, however, ambidextrous robot picking is still an important and challenging issue. We found the fusion of different prehensile actions (grasp and suction) can expand the range of objects that can be picked by robot, and the fusion of prehensile action and nonprehensile action (push) can expand the picking space of ambidextrous robot. In this paper, we propose a Push-Grasp-Suction (PGS) integrated network for Cites: Espnet: Efficient spatial pyramid of dilated convolutions for
