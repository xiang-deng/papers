Large pre-trained language models (LMs) such as GPT-3 Codex are able to generate code remarkably well given prompts of natural language text. But if we want to use such LMs to generate code compatible with a specific API or library (eg, an API which provides the environments in which certain rules, laws, or orders are to be carried out), the amount of computational and data resources required to fine-tune such models can be cost prohibitive to most organizations. Given these practical Cites: Codebleu: a method for automatic evaluation of code synthesis
