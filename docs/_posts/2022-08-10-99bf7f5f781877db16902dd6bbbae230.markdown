Microfossil fish teeth, known as ichthyoliths, provide a key constraint on the depositional age and environment of deep-sea sediments, especially pelagic clays where siliceous and calcareous microfossils are rarely observed. However, traditional methods for the observation of ichthyoliths require considerable time and manual labor, which can hinder their wider application. In this study, we constructed a system to automatically detect ichthyoliths in microscopic images by combining two Cites: Efficientnetv2: Smaller models and faster training
