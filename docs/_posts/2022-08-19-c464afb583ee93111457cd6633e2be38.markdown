State-of-the-art deep learning models are often built at the cost of collecting a large amount of labeled training data. However, the requirement of exhaustive manual annotations may degrade the model s generalizability when learning in the limited-label regime. Semi-supervised learning and unsupervised learning offer promising paradigms to learn from an abundance of unlabeled visual data. Recent progress in these paradigms has indicated the strong benefits of leveraging unlabeled data to Cites: LXMERT: Learning Cross-Modality Encoder Representations from
