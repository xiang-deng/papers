Effectively utilizing LLMs for complex tasks is challenging, often involving a time-consuming and uncontrollable prompt engineering process. This paper introduces a novel human-LLM interaction framework, Low-code LLM. It incorporates six types of simple low-code visual programming interactions, all supported by clicking, dragging, or text editing, to achieve more controllable and stable responses. Through visual interaction with a graphical user interface, users can incorporate their ideas …
