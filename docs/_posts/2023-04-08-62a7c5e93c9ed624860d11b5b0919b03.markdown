Abstract t is often the case that collections of documents are annotated with hierarchically-structured concepts. However, the benefits of this structure are rarely taken into account by commonly-used classification techniques.

With this work, we aim to deliver an updated overview of current research in this domain. We begin by definingthe task Cites: Errudite: Scalable, reproducible, and testable error analysis
