Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by their inability to process lengthy inputs. To address this limitation, we propose the Self-Controlled Memory (SCM) system to unleash infinite-length input capacity for large-scale language models. Our SCM system is composed of three key modules: the language model agent, the memory stream, and the memory controller. The language model agent iteratively processes ultra-long inputs and stores all historical information in the  Cites: H. Chi, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Oriol Vinyals, Percy Liang, Jeff Dean
