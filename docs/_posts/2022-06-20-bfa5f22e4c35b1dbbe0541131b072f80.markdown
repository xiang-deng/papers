Few-shot intent detection is a practical challenge task, because new intents are frequently emerging and collecting large-scale data for them could be costly. Meta-learning, a promising technique for leveraging data from previous tasks to enable efficient learning of new tasks, has been a popular way to tackle this problem. However, the existing meta-learning models have been evidenced to be overfitting when the meta-training tasks are insufficient. To overcome this challenge, we present  Cites: SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings
