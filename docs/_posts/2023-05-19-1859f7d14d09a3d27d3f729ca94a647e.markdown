In this paper, we study how to improve the zero-shot reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs) over structured data in a unified way. Inspired by the study on tool augmentation for LLMs, we develop an\emph {Iterative Reading-then-Reasoning~(IRR)} approach for solving question answering tasks based on structured data, called\textbf {StructGPT}. In our approach, we construct the specialized function to collect relevant evidence from structured data (\ie\emph  Cites: Unik-qa: Unified representations of structured and unstructured
