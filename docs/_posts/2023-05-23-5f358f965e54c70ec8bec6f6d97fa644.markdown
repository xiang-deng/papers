Abstract Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have significantly improved their application in dermatology. However, bias issues in AI systems can result in missed diagnoses and disparities in healthcare, especially for individuals with different skin types. This dissertation aims to investigate and improve the fairness and bias in machine learning models for dermatology by evaluating and enhancing their performance across different Fitzpatrick skin types.
