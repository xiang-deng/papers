The management of Big Data requires flexible systems to handle the heterogeneity of data models as well as the complexity of analytical workflows. Traditional systems like data warehouses have reached their limits due to their rigid schema-on-write paradigm, that requires well identified and defined use cases to ingest data. Data lakes, with their schema-on-read paradigm, have been proposed as more flexible systems in which raw data are directly stored in their original format associated with Cites: Managing Google s data lake: an overview of the Goods system.
