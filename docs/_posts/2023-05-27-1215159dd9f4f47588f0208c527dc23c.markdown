We introduce ClusterLLM, a novel text clustering framework that leverages feedback from an instruction-tuned large language model, such as ChatGPT. Compared with traditional unsupervised methods that builds upon small embedders, ClusterLLM exhibits two intriguing advantages:(1) it enjoys the emergent capability of LLM even if its embeddings are inaccessible; and (2) it understands the user s preference on clustering through textual instruction and/or a few annotated data. First, we prompt  Cites: New Frontiers of Information Extraction
