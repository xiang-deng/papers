In this paper, we overview the emerging field of knowledge graph embedding and present our recent results in efficient and expressive knowledge graph embedding methods for link prediction. Knowledge graph embedding methods aim to perform link prediction by learning the embeddings of entities and relations. Previous work has usually treated each embedding as a whole and has modeled the interactions between these whole embeddings, potentially making the model excessively Cites: Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text
