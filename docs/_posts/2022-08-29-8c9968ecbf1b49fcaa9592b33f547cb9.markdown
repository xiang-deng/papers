Using the fine-grained entity typing method of distant supervision, when assigning type labels to entity mention, since the knowledge base contains all type labels of the entity, noisy labels will be introduced. This paper proposed a Fine-grained Entity Typing model combined with Features (FETF) to reduce the negative impact of noisy labels. It is different from the previous methods such as manual annotation and heuristic rule pruning. The model not only improves the classification efficiency, but  Cites: An attentive neural architecture for fine-grained entity type
