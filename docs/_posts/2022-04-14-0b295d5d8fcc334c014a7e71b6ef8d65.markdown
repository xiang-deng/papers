Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing our ability to understand and predict the complex relationships between protein sequence, structure, and function. Predictive sequencefunction models are enabling protein engineers to efficiently search the sequence space for useful proteins with broad applications in biotechnology. In this review, we highlight the recent advances in applying ML to protein engineering. We discuss supervised learning methods that infer the sequencefunction mapping from Cites: Deep neural language modeling enables functional protein
