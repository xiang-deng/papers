Deep learning has become ubiquitous, touching daily lives across the globe. Today, traditional computer architectures are stressed to their limits in efficiently executing the growing complexity of data and models. Compute‐in‐memory (CIM) can potentially play an important role in developing efficient hardware solutions that reduce data movement from compute‐unit to memory, known as the von Neumann bottleneck. At its heart is a cross‐bar architecture with nodal non‐volatile‐memory …
