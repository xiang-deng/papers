Deep learning has become ubiquitous, touching daily lives across the globe. Today, traditional computer architectures are stressed to their limits in efficiently executing the growing complexity of data and models. Computeinmemory (CIM) can potentially play an important role in developing efficient hardware solutions that reduce data movement from computeunit to memory, known as the von Neumann bottleneck. At its heart is a crossbar architecture with nodal nonvolatilememory Cites: Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a
