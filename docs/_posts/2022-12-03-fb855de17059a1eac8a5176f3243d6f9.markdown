Exploit code is widely used for detecting vulnerabilities and implementing defensive measures. However, automatic generation of exploit code for security assessment is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel template-augmented exploit code generation approach ExploitGen based on CodeBERT. Specifically, we first propose a rule-based Template Parser to generate template-augmented natural language descriptions (NL). Both the raw and template-augmented NL sequences  Cites: Tranx: A transition-based neural abstract syntax parser for
