Background For clinical decision making, it is crucial to identify patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who may benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In this study, a deep learning-based system was designed and validated using pre-therapy computed tomography (CT) images to predict the survival benefits of EGFR-TKIs and ICIs in stage IV NSCLC patients. Methods This retrospective study collected data from 570 patients with …
