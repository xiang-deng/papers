We provide a simple and general solution for the discovery of scarce topics in unbalanced short-text datasets, namely, a word co-occurrence network-based model CWIBTD, which can simultaneously address the sparsity and unbalance of short-text topics and attenuate the effect of occasional pairwise occurrences of words, allowing the model to focus more on the discovery of scarce topics. Unlike previous approaches, CWIBTD uses co-occurrence word networks to model the topic Cites: Applications of topic models
