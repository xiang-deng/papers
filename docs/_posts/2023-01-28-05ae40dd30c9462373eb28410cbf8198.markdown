Natural language interfaces (NLIs) enable users to flexibly specify analytical intentions in data visualization. However, diagnosing the visualization results without understanding the underlying generation process is challenging.

The system introduces a Provenance Generator to reveal the detailed Cites: Explaining Queries over Web Tables to Non-Experts
