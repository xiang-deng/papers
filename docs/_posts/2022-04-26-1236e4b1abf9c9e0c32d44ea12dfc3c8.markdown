The quadratic memory complexity of Transformers prevents long document summarization in low computational resource scenarios. State-of-the-art models need to apply input truncation, thus discarding and ignoring potential summary- relevant contents, leading to a performance drop. Furthermore, such loss is generally destructive for semantic text analytics in the legal domain. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic selfsegmentation (Se3) approach for long document summarization Cites: Discourse-Aware Neural Extractive Text Summarization
