Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have revolutionized the field of representation learning on graph data with non-Euclidean properties. As one of its variants, Graph attention networks (GATs) leverage masked self-attentional layers to specify different weights when aggregating node features over the neighbourhoods of graphs. GATs have achieved the state-of-the-arts results across many benchmarking datasets for the task of node classification. However, this method is …
