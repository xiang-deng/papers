Evolutionary Computation algorithms have been used to solve optimization problems in relation with architectural, hyper-parameter or training configuration, forging the field known today as Neural Architecture Search. These algorithms have been combined with other techniques such as the pruning of Neural Networks, which reduces the complexity of the network, and the Transfer Learning, which lets the import of knowledge from another problem related to the one at hand. The usage of …
