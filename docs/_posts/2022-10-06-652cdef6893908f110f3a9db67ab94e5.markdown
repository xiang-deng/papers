Planning a robot s task-space movement according to its actual capacity is a difficult problem because this capacity depends on its state and thus can evolve significantly during the execution of the movement. This paper proposes a method for real-time trajectory planning based on time-optimal Trapezoidal acceleration profile (TAP) trajectories, that adapts to the real-time evolution of the robot s capacity. The method is based on an efficient approach for projecting the robot s kinematic limits in the  Cites: Legibility and predictability of robot motion
