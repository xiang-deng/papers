Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation of key components is a particularly important link in the reliability evaluation of overall unit. Due to complex nonlinearity and uncertainty in degradation process of mechanical systems, conventional methods are difficult to fulfil the accurate medium & long-term predictive maintenance tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel concurrent residual temporal convolution network in repeat-explore mode (CRTCN-RE Mode), which utilizes multi Cites: Effective approaches to attention-based neural machine translation
