Learned representations of scientific documents can serve as valuable input features for downstream tasks, without the need for further fine-tuning. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating these representations fail to capture the diversity of relevant tasks. In response, we introduce SciRepEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for training and evaluating scientific document representations. It includes 25 challenging and realistic tasks, 11 of which are new, across four formats …
