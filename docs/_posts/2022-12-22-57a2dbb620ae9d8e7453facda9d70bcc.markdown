Ultra-fine entity typing (UFET) predicts extremely free-formed types (eg, president, politician) of a given entity mention (eg, Joe Biden) in context. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods use the cross-encoder (CE) based architecture. CE concatenates the mention (and its context) with each type and feeds the pairs into a pretrained language model (PLM) to score their relevance. It brings deeper interaction between mention and types to reach better performance but has to perform N (type set size) Cites: Modeling fine-grained entity types with box embeddings
