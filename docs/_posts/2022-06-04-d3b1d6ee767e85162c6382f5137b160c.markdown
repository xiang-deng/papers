Deep learning has enabled breakthroughs in challenging computing problems and has emerged as the standard problem-solving tool for computer vision and natural language processing tasks. One exception to this trend is safety-critical tasks where robustness and resilience requirements contradict the black-box nature of neural networks. To deploy deep learning methods for these tasks, it is vital to provide guarantees on neural network agents  safety and robustness criteria. This can be  Cites: Fine-tuning can distort pretrained features and underperform out-of
