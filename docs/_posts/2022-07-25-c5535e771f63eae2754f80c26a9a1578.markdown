Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) is important to make structured information accessible without formal query language expertise on the part of the users. The semantic parsing (SP) avor of this task maps a natural language question to a formal query that is machine executable, such as SPARQL. The SP-KGQA task is currently evaluated by adopting measures from other tasks, such as information retrieval and machine translation. However, this adoption typically occurs without Cites: Multi-task learning for conversational question answering over a
