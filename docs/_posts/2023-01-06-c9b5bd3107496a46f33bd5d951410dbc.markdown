Knowledge reasoning technology can infer new knowledge based on the existing entity relationship information in the knowledge graph to complement the knowledge graph. In the existing knowledge reasoning methods based on multi-step relationship paths, the contributions of entities and relationships in the relationship paths are not distinguished, nor are multiple relationship paths comprehensively considered. To solve these problems, we propose a knowledge reasoning model  Cites: Incorporating vector space similarity in random walk inference over
