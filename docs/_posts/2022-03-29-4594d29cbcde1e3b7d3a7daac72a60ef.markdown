Abstract Machine Translation (MT) has come a long way in recent years, but it still suffers from data scarcity issue due to lack of parallel corpora for low (or sometimes zero) resource languages. However, Transfer Learning (TL) is one of the directions widely used for low-resource machine translation systems to overcome this issue. Creating parallel corpus for such languages is another way of dealing with data scarcity, yet costly, time-consuming and laborious task.
