The impact of software vulnerabilities on daily-used software systems is alarming. Despite numerous proposed deep learning-based models to automate vulnerability detection, the detection of software vulnerabilities remains a significant issue. While some techniques report high precision/recall scores of up to 99%, our experience leads us to believe that these models may underperform in realistic settings, specifically when evaluating vulnerability detection models on the entire source code …
