Building autonomous systems for deployment in the open world has been a longstanding objective in both artificial intelligence and robotics. The open world, however, presents challenges that question some of the assumptions often made in contemporary AI models. Autonomous systems that operate in the open world face complex, non-stationary environments wherein enumerating all situations the system may face over the course of its deployment is intractable. Nevertheless, these  Cites: Competence-based Curriculum Learning for Neural Machine
