Knowledge Graph represents the real world s information in the form of triplets (head, relation, and tail). However, most Knowledge Graphs are highly incomplete. The goal of a Knowledge-Graph Completion task is to predict missing links in a given Knowledge Graph. Various approaches exist to predict a missing link in a Knowledge Graph, but the most prominent approaches are based on tensor factorization and Knowledge-Graph embeddings, such as RotatE and SimplE.
