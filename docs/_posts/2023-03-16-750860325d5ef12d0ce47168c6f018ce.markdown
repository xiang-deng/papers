The paper studies the capabilities of Recurrent-Neural-Network sequence to sequence (RNN seq2seq) models in learning four string-to-string transduction tasks: identity, reversal, total reduplication, and input-specified reduplication. These transductions are traditionally well studied under finite state transducers and attributed with varying complexity. We find that RNN seq2seq models are only able to approximate a mapping that fits the training or in-distribution data. Attention helps …
