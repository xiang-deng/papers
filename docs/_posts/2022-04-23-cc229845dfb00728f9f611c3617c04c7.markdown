Epilepsy is a disease that decreases the quality of life of patients; it is also among the most common neurological diseases. Several studies have approached the classification and prediction of seizures by using electroencephalographic data and machine learning techniques. A large diversity of features has been extracted from electroencephalograms to perform classification tasks; therefore, it is important to use feature selection methods to select those that leverage pattern recognition.
