Compiled software is delivered as executable binary code. Developers write source code to express the software semantics, but the compiler converts it to a binary format that the CPU can directly execute. Therefore, binary code analysis is critical to applications in reverse engineering and computer security tasks where source code is not available. However, unlike source code and natural language that contain rich semantic information, binary code is typically difficult for human engineers to Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
