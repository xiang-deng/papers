Most research on question answering focuses on the pre-deployment stage; ie, building an accurate model for deployment. In this paper, we ask the question: Can we improve QA systems further emph {post-} deployment based on user interactions? We focus on two kinds of improvements: 1) improving the QA system s performance itself, and 2) providing the model with the ability to explain the correctness or incorrectness of an answer. We collect a retrieval-based QA dataset Cites: Does the whole exceed its parts? the effect of ai explanations on
