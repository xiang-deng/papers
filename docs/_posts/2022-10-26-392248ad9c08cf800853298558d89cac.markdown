Expert decision-makers (DMs) in high-stakes AI-advised (AIDeT) settings receive and reconcile recommendations from AI systems before making their final decisions. We identify distinct properties of these settings which are key to developing AIDeT models that effectively benefit team performance. First, DMs in AIDeT settings exhibit algorithm discretion behavior (ADB), ie, an idiosyncratic tendency to imperfectly accept or reject algorithmic recommendations for any given decision task. Second Cites: Does the whole exceed its parts? the effect of ai explanations on
