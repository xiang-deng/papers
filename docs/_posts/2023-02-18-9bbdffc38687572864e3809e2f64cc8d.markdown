Hyperspectral images taken from aircraft or satellites contain information from hundreds of spectral bands, within which lie latent lower-dimensional structures that can be exploited for classifying vegetation and other materials. A disadvantage of working with hyperspectral images is that, due to an inherent trade-off between spectral and spatial resolution, they have a relatively coarse spatial scale, meaning that single pixels may correspond to spatial regions containing multiple materials …
