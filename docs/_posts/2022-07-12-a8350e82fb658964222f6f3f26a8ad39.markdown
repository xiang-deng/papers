Attributed networks, as a manifestation of data in non-Euclidean domains, have a wide range of applications in the real world, such as molecular property prediction, social network analysis and anomaly detection. Node classification, as a fundamental research problem in attributed networks, has attracted increasing attention among research communities. However, most existing models cannot be directly applied to the data with limited labeled instances (\textiti. e., the few-shot  Cites: Meta-Information Guided Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Relation
