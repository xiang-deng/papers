Abstractive summarization models can generate summary auto-regressively, but the quality is often impacted by the noise in the text. Learning cross-sentence relations is a crucial step in this task and the graph-based network is more effective to capture the sentence relationship. Moreover, knowledge is very important to distinguish the noise of the text in special domain. A novel model structure called UGDAS is proposed in this paper, which combines a sentence-level denoiser based on an Cites: Optimizing the factual correctness of a summary: A study of
