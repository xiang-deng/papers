Robust optimization is an ideal solution for enhancing safety in tunnel construction in the presence of unpredictable soil conditions, especially in large-diameter tunnel construction, since it requires the least amount of information about uncertainties. However, the application of robust optimization to real-world projects is greatly hampered by its dependence on mathematical models. To address this issue, this study builds a pipeline machine learning model to forecast tunnel-induced damage  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
