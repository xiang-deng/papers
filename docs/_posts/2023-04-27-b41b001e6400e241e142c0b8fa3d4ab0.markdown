Moreover, GPT-based zero-shot classification models tend to make independent predictions over test instances, which can be sub-optimal as the instance correlations and the decision boundaries in the target space are ignored. To address these difficulties and limitations, we propose a new approach to zero-shot text classification, namely\ourmodelshort, which leverages the strong generative power of GPT to assist in training a smaller, more adaptable, and efficient sentence encoder  Cites: Nearest neighbor zero-shot inference
