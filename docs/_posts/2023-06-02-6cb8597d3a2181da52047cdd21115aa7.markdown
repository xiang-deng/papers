Need of natural language processing (NLP) applications and advancement in deep learning (DL) techniques have increased the need of large amount of human readable data leading to interesting research area named entity recognition (NER), which is a sub-task of natural language processing. NER identifies and tags different real-life entities in their pre-defined categories. Pre-defined categories include person, locations, times, organizations, events, etc., depending upon dataset in  Cites: Unsupervised named-entity extraction from the web: An
