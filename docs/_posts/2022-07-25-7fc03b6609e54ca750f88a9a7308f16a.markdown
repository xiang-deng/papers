Learning and Memory is a branch of artificial intelligence that studies the critical brain functions in order to create novel computational intelligence techniques and methods focused on learning and memory. As a consequence, human intelligence demands a review on computational intelligence techniques in learning and memory. This paper explains why without learning, the goal of achieving human intelligence is still a long bit away.
