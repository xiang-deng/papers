This chapter introduces a hybrid deep learning model for COVID-19 spread forecasting. Specifically, the proposed approach combines the desirable characteristics of bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and an attention mechanism. Importantly, this combination, called BiLSTM-A-CNN, is intended to amalgamate the ability of LSTMs to model time dependencies, the capability of the attention mechanism to highlight relevant Cites: Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate
