Abstract To easier manipulate Knowledge Graphs (KGs), knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is proposed and wildly used. However, the relations between entities are usually incomplete due to the performance problems of knowledge extraction methods, which also leads to the sparsity of KGs and make it difficult for KGE methods to obtain reliable representations. Related research has not paid much attention to this challenge in the biomedicine field and has not sufficiently integrated …
