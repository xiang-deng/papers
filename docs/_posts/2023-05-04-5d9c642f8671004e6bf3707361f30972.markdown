Adversarial contrastive learning (ACL), without requiring labels, incorporates adversarial data with standard contrastive learning (SCL) and outputs a robust representation which is generalizable and resistant to adversarial attacks and common corruptions. The style-independence property of representations has been validated to be beneficial in improving robustness transferability. Standard invariant regularization (SIR) has been proposed to make the learned representations via SCL Cites: Fine-tuning can distort pretrained features and underperform out-of
