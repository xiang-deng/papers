Due to the development and consolidation of classical spectrographic techniques, many mining industries have extensive libraries of monopixel drill core spectra. In addition, laboratory characterization based on multispectral sampling by identifying and comparing reference spectral characteristics is used in many industrial processes. This work delves into the implementation of statistical generative modelling techniques for the characterization of mineral samples captured by …
