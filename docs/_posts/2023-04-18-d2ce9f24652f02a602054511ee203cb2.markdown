A classic question in the study of human cognition is: what are the learning biases that make it possible for them to learn and process language? A similar question can now be asked in the study of machine intelligence: to build machine learning models for language, what are the necessary inductive biases that enable learning in an efficient and generalisable manner? We need to identify the learning biases that enable the learning of natural language, and find ways to incorporate them into …
