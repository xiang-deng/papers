Neural networks drive the success of natural language processing. A fundamental property of natural languages is their compositional structure, allowing us to describe new meanings systematically. However, neural networks notoriously struggle with systematic generalization and do not necessarily benefit from a compositional structure in emergent communication simulations. Here, we test how neural networks compare to humans in learning and generalizing a new language. We do this by  Cites: On the opportunities and risks of foundation models
