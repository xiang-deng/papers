Abstract Information systems that have to deal with natural language text are often equipped with application-specific techniques for solving various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. One of those tasks, extracting entities and their relations from human-readable text, is relevant for downstream tasks like automated model extraction (eg UML diagrams, business process models) and question answering (eg in chatbots). In NLP the rapidly evolving research field of Relation Extraction denotes  Cites: Learning from Context or Names? An Empirical Study on Neural
