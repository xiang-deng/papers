Relation prediction is a task designed for knowledge graph completion which aims to predict missing relationships between entities. Recent subgraph-based models for inductive relation prediction have received increasing attention, which can predict relation for unseen entities based on the extracted subgraph surrounding the candidate triplet. However, they are not completely inductive because of their disability of predicting unseen relations. Moreover, they fail to pay sufficient attention  Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
