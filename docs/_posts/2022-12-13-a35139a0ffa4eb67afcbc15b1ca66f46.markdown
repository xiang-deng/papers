Using a convex approach, a non-convex optimal control problem is expressed and solved in this research. Following the creation of a solution, several tests are applied to verify its physical feasibility and optimality with quantitative analysis. Fuel-optimal powered landings are non-convex problems derived from the non-convex original problem. The free final time, mass depletion dynamics, and aerodynamic drag are among the non-convexities present in this problem. Using lossless convexification …
