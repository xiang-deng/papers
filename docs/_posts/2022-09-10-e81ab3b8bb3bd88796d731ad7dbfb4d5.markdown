Deep code generation is a topic of deep learning for software engineering (DL4SE), which adopts neural models to generate code for the intended functions. Since end-to-end neural methods lack the awareness of domain knowledge and software hierarchy, the results often require manual correction. To systematically explore the potential improvements of code generation, we let it participate in the whole top-down development from intentions to realizations, which is possible in limited Cites: A Systematic Evaluation of Large Language Models of Code
