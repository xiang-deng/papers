How to transfer the semantic information in a sentence to a computable numerical embedding form is a fundamental problem in natural language processing. An informative universal sentence embedding can greatly promote subsequent natural language processing tasks. However, unlike universal word embeddings, a widely accepted general-purpose sentence embedding technique has not been developed. This survey summarizes the current universal sentence-embedding methods Cites: Learning distributed representations of sentences from unlabelled
