Abstract Knowledge graph alignment aims to identify entity pairs having the same meaning between different knowledge graphs, which is essential to the automated construction of a coherent knowledge base. With the development of knowledge representation learning, researchers have proposed several useful embedding-based alignment methods. In practice, some entities are easily aligned with high confidence while others are not. However, there is a lack of effective methods which Cites: Glove: Global vectors for word representation
