The automation of an increasingly large number of software engineering tasks is becoming possible thanks to Machine Learning (ML). One foundational building block in the application of ML to software artifacts is the representation of these artifacts (eg, source code or executable code) into a form that is suitable for learning. Many studies have leveraged representation learning, delegating to ML itself the job of automatically devising suitable representations. Yet, in the context of Android  Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
