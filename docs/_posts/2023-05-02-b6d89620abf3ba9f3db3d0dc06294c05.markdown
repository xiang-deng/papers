Large Language Models (LLMs), with their advanced architectures and training on massive language datasets, contain unexplored knowledge. One method to infer this knowledge is through the use of cloze-style prompts. Typically, these prompts are manually designed because the phrasing of these prompts impacts the knowledge retrieval performance, even if the LLM encodes the desired information. In this paper, we study the impact of prompt syntax on the knowledge retrieval capacity of LLMs …
