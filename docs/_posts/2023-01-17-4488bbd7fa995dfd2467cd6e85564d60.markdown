We mathematically characterize the cognitive capabilities that enable humans to effectively guide others through natural language. We show that neural-network-based instruction generation agents possess similar cognitive capabilities, and design an evaluation scheme for probing those capabilities. Our results indicate that these agents, while capable of effectively narrowing the search space, poorly predict the listener s interpretations of their instructions and thus often fail to select the best  Cites: Neural theory-of-mind? on the limits of social intelligence in large lms
