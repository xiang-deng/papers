Task-oriented semantic communication has garnered increasing attention due to its ability to reduce the amount of transmitted data without sacrificing task performance. While existing works have focused on designing advanced semantic communication architectures and efficient semantic codecs, challenges such as explainable and efficient semantic representation methods, and knowledge-based semantic compression algorithms have yet to be explored. These challenges have hindered …
