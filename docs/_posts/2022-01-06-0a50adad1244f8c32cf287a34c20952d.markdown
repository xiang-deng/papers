In this paper, we proposed a model which tries to generate natural language tweets. Sometime it becomes difficult for us to share information about certain incidents instantly. We have analyzed the Kolkata Police Traffic Twitter handle for day to day traffic-related tweets and tried to generate a new tweet based on certain Natural Language Generation (NLG) techniques. In the classical Rule-based text generation domain some rigid rules, templates, and heuristics are employed. Due to the lack of Cites: A simple domain-independent probabilistic approach to generation
