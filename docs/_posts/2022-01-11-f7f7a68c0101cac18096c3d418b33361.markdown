Recently, aspect-level sentiment analysis methods using graph convolutional network (GCN)-based structures with fairly good performance have been introduced. However, previous GCN-based methods often experience one of the following limitations. First, GCNs usually use edges with binary weights. However, binary weights are not helpful in many tasks. Second, these GCNs only focus on extracting node features from some single words or phrases and ignore their context in the Cites: Adaptive recursive neural network for target-dependent twitter
