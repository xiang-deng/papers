We propose an effective prompting approach that integrates self-evaluation guidance through stochastic beam search. Our approach explores the reasoning search space using a well-calibrated automatic criterion. This enables an efficient search to produce higher-quality final predictions. With the self-evaluation guided stochastic beam search, we also balance the quality--diversity trade-off in the generation of reasoning chains. This allows our approach to adapt well with majority Cites: Beyond the imitation game: Quantifying and extrapolating the
