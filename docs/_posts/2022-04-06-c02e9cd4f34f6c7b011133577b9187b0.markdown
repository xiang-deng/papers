Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a pivotal nucleic acid that plays a crucial role in regulating many biological activities. Recently, one study utilized a machine learning algorithm to automatically classify RNA structural events generated by a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A nanopore trap. Although it can achieve desirable classification results, compared with deep learning (DL) methods, this classic machine learning requires domain knowledge to manually extract features, which is sophisticated Cites: Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with
