Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a multidisciplinary field. It has become essential for robots to work with humans in collaboration and teamwork settings, such as collaborative assembly, where they share tasks in an overlapping workspace. While extensive research is available to ensure successful HRI, primarily focusing on the safety factors, our objective is to provide a comprehensive perspective on robot s compatibility with humans in such settings. Specifically, we highlight the key pillars Cites: Legibility and predictability of robot motion
