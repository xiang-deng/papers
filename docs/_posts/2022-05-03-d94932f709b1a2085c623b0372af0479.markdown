Fault diagnosis in aero-engines typically requires an experienced expert for understanding and detecting the cause of faults. However, accurate and quick identification of fault parts is difficult for maintenance crews owing to the complexity of aero-engines. In this study, we developed a case-based reasoning (CBR) system with a highly accurate novel similarity measure for fault diagnosis of aero-engines by retrieving similar fault cases. The proposed CBR system is established based on 143 Cites: Measuring distributional similarity in context
