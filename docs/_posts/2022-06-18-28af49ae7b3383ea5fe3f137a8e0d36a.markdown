Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) have been widely used in graph learning and related applications. It has been identified that the filters in the state-of-the-art spectral graph convolutional networks (SGCNs) are essentially low-pass filters that enforce smoothness across the graph and use the functions of graph Laplacian as a tool that injects graph structure into the learning algorithm. There had been research findings that connect the smoothness functional in graphs, graph  Cites: A regularization framework for learning from graph data
