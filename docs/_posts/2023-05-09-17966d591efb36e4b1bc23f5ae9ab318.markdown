In this paper, we present the Self-Adapting Reasoning Model (SAR) for solving multi-hop question answering (MHQA) tasks, where the QA system is supposed to find the correct answer within the given multiple documents and a multi-hop question. One feasible track on MHQA is question decomposition, based on the idea that a multi-hop question is usually made from several single-hop questions, which are much easier to answer. However, ignoring the inner connection between sub-questions …
