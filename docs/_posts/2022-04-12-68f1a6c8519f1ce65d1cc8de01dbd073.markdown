An ultimate goal of artificial intelligence is to build computer systems that can understand human languages. Understanding commonsense knowledge about the world expressed in text is one of the foundational and challenging problems to create such intelligent systems. As a step towards this goal, we present in this paper ALMEn, an Autoencoding Language Model based Ensemble learning method for commonsense validation and explanation.
