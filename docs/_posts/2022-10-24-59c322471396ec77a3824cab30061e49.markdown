Graph embedding, aiming to learn low-dimensional representations (aka. embeddings) of nodes in graphs, has received significant attention. In recent years, there has been a surge of efforts, among which graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as an effective class of models. However, these methods mainly focus on the static graph embedding. In the present work, an efficient dynamic graph embedding approach is proposed, called dynamic GCN (DyGCN), which is an Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
