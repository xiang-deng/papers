At present, machine learning is more efficient and accurate for the efficiency of operation logic after four stages of reform. In order to improve the participation rate of the whole people in track and field sports and get a better level and ranking in track and field competitions, the ATI model under the machine model is used to deeply analyze the behavior of track and field sports in order to get more accurate data. There are a series of problems in the process of correlation analysis, such as the loss Cites: Reconciling schemas of disparate data sources: A machine
