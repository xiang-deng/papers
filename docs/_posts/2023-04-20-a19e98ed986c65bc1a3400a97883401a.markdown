In this technical report, we evaluated the performance of the ChatGPT and GPT-3 models for the task of vulnerability detection in code. Our evaluation was conducted on our real-world dataset, using binary and multi-label classification tasks on CWE vulnerabilities. We decided to evaluate the model because it has shown good performance on other code-based tasks, such as solving programming challenges and understanding code at a high level. However, we found that the ChatGPT model Cites: Sparks of artificial general intelligence: Early experiments with gpt-4
