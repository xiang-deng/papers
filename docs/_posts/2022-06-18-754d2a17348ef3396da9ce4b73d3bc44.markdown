Path-based methods are more appealing solutions than embedding methods for knowledge graph reasoning, due to their interpretability and generalization ability to unseen graphs. However, path-based methods usually suffer from the problem of scalability, as the time complexity grows exponentially wrt the length of paths. While recent methods compute reasoning paths with the Bellman-Ford algorithm in polynomial time, the time and memory cost remains very high, as they need to  Cites: Compositional learning of embeddings for relation paths in
