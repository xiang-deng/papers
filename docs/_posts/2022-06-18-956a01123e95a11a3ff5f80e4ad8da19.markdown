In order to automate the inventive problem-solving knowledge retrieval contained in patent documents by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We propose three main contributions: i) two similar problem retrieval models called IDM-Similar based on Word2vec neural networks and SAMIDM based on LSTM neural networks are proposed to retrieve similar problems from different domains patents; ii) a problem-solution matching model named IDM-Matching according to XLNet neural …
