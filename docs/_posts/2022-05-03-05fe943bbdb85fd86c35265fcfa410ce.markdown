Humans have a remarkably large capacity to store detailed visual information in long- term memory even after a single exposure, as demonstrated by classic experiments in psychology. For example, Standing (1973) showed that humans could recognize with high accuracy thousands of pictures that they had seen only once a few days prior to a recognition test. In deep learning, the primary mode of incorporating new information into a model is through gradient descent in the model s parameter space Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
