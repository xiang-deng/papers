In this paper, we present a review of the recent work in deep learning methods for user interface design. The survey encompasses well known deep learning techniques (deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks) and datasets widely used to design user interface applications. We highlight important problems and emerging research frontiers in this field. We believe that the use of deep learning for  Cites: Autofolding for source code summarization
