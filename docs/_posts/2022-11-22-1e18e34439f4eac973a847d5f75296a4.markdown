Data Augmentation (DA) methodsa family of techniques designed for synthetic generation of training datahave shown remarkable results in various Deep Learning and Machine Learning tasks. Despite its widespread and successful adoption within the computer vision community, DA techniques designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks have exhibited much slower advances and limited success in achieving performance gains. As a consequence, with the exception of  Cites: Paraphrasing revisited with neural machine translation
