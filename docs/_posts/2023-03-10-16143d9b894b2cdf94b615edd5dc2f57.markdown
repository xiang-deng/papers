Combining structured information with language models is a standing problem in NLP. Building on previous work, we study how lightweight neural networks, known as adapters, can be used to inject information from a knowledge graph into two popular pre-trained language models based on the transformer architecture. The adapters are trained using the masked language modeling objective over extracted triples from ConceptNet, a knowledge graph that captures a range of world …
