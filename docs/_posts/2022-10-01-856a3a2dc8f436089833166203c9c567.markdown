Large-Language Models like GPT-3 have the potential to enable HCI designers and researchers to create more human-like and helpful chatbots for specific applications. But evaluating the feasibility of these chatbots and designing prompts that optimize GPT-3 for a specific task is challenging. We present a case study in tackling these questions, applying GPT-3 to a brief 5-minute chatbot that anyone can talk to better manage their mood. We report a randomized factorial experiment with 945  Cites: AI Chains: Transparent and Controllable Human-AI Interaction by
