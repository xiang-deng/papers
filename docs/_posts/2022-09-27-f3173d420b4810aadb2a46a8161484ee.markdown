More than 60 waste incineration plants (WIPs) are active across Germany. WIPs have various levels of automation, but they still rely on manual operations by human operators. Human operators tend to rely on a few operational levers and infrequent interventions to manage the complex combustion process. Consequently, the combustion process is managed rather inefficiently, and steam outputs and emission levels are not optimal. This article investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) can …
