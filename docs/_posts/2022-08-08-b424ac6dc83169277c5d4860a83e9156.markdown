Transformers have achieved impressive performance in natural language processing and computer vision, including text translation, semantic segmentation, etc. However, due to excessive self-attention computation and memory occupation, the stereo matching task does not share its success. To promote this technology in stereo matching, especially with limited hardware resources, we propose a sliding space-disparity transformer named SSD-former. According to matching modeling, we Cites: SpanBERT: Improving Pre-training by Representing and Predicting
