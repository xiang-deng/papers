Label noise widely exists in large-scale datasets and significantly degenerates the performances of deep learning algorithms. Due to the non-identifiability of the instance-dependent noise transition matrix, most existing algorithms address the problem by assuming the noisy label generation process to be independent of the instance features. Unfortunately, noisy labels in real-world applications often depend on both the true label and the features. In this work, we tackle instance-dependent Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
