Many tools are available to query a dependency treebank, but they require the users to know a query language. This paper presents UDeasy, an application whose main goal is to allow the users to easily query and extract patterns from a dependency treebank in CoNLL-U format. To do this, users are prompted in a series of dialogs to enter relevant information about syntactic nodes, their properties, relationship, and positions.
