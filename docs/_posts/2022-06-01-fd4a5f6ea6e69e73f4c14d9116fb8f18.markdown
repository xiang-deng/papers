This paper investigates the prediction of mobile traffic load based on four variants of recurrent neural networks, which are the simple long short‐term memory (LSTM), stacked LSTM, gated recurrent unit (GRU) and bidirectional LSTM. In the considered schemes, the mobile traffic load of 15 min ahead of time is estimated based on the previous mobile traffic load data. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified using realistic traffic load data collected from the base station located in … Cites: ‪Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder …‬
