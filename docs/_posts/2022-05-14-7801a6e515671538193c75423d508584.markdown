Recent works explore collaboration between humans and teams of robots. These approaches make sense if the human is already working with the robot team; but how should robots encourage nearby humans to join their teams in the first place? Inspired by behavioral economics, we recognize that humans care about more than just team efficiency--humans also have biases and expectations for team dynamics. Our hypothesis is that the way inclusive robots divide the task (ie, how the robots split Cites: Legibility and predictability of robot motion
