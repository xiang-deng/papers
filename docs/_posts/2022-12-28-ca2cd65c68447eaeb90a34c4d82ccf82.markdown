Question-answering understanding systems are of central importance to many natural language processing tasks. A successful question-answering system first needs to accurately mine the semantics of the problem text and then match the semantic similarity between the question and the answer. Most of the current pre-training language modes use joint coding of questions and answers, a pre-training language model to avoid the problem of feature extraction from multilevel text …
