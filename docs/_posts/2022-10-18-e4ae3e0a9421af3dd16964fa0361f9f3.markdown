We present an empirical study on methods for span finding, the selection of consecutive tokens in text for some downstream tasks. We focus on approaches that can be employed in training end-to-end information extraction systems. We recognize there is no silver bullet that can simply solve all downstream tasks well without considering task properties and provide our observations to help with design choices in the future: 1) tagging method usually yields a higher precision while span Cites: Learning recurrent span representations for extractive question
