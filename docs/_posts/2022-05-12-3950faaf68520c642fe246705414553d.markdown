Human activity recognition is one of the most studied topics in the field of computer vision. In recent years, with the availability of RGB-D sensors and powerful deep learning techniques, research on human activity recognition has gained momentum. From simple human atomic actions, the research has advanced towards recognizing more complex human activities using RGB-D data. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the advanced deep learning based recognition methods Cites: Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with
