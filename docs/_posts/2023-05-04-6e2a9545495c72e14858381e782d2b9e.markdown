In this paper, we explore a novel model reusing task tailored for graph neural networks (GNNs), termed as deep graph reprogramming . We strive to reprogram a pre-trained GNN, without amending raw node features nor model parameters, to handle a bunch of cross-level downstream tasks in various domains. To this end, we propose an innovative Data Reprogramming paradigm alongside a Model Reprogramming paradigm. The former one aims to address the challenge of Cites: On the opportunities and risks of foundation models
