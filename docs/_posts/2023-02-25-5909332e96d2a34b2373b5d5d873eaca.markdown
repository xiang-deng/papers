Data scarcity is a problem that occurs in languages and tasks where we do not have large amounts of labeled data but want to use state-of-the-art models. Such models are often deep learning models that require a significant amount of data to train. Acquiring data for various machine learning problems is accompanied by high labeling costs. Data augmentation is a low-cost approach for tackling data scarcity. This paper gives an overview of current state-of-the-art data augmentation methods …
