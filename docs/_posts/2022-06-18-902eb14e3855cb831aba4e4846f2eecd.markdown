Amid mounting concern about the reliability and credibility of machine learning research, we present a principled framework for making robust and generalizable claims: the Multiverse Analysis. Our framework builds upon the Multiverse Analysis (Steegen et al., 2016) introduced in response to psychology s own reproducibility crisis. To efficiently explore high-dimensional and often continuous ML search spaces, we model the multiverse with a Gaussian Process surrogate and apply  Cites: Green AI
