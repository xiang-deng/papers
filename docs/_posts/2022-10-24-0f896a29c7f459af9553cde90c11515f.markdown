I would like to thank my daily supervisor Thomas Winters for his guidance and feedback throughout this year. I would also like to thank my friends that helped me with rating the numerous templates and giving their preference for the difficulty rankings. Finally, I would like to thank my family for their support throughout all the years and especially my mother. Without her I would have missed out on a lot of opportunities in life.
