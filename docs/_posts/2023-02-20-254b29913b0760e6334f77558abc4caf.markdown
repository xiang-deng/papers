Risk assessment algorithms are being adopted by public sector agencies to make high-stakes decisions about human lives. Algorithms model risk based on individual client characteristics to identify clients most in need. However, this understanding of risk is primarily based on easily quantifiable risk factors that present an incomplete and biased perspective of clients. We conducted a computational narrative analysis of child-welfare casenotes and draw attention to deeper systemic Cites: Applications of topic models
