Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity due to their ability to perform ad-hoc Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks with a simple natural language prompt. Part of the appeal for LLMs is their approachability to the general public, including individuals with no prior technical experience in NLP techniques. However, natural language prompts can vary significantly in terms of their linguistic structure, context, and other semantics.
