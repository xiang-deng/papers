Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) aims to extract aspects from review sentences along with their corresponding opinions and sentiments to form opinion triplets. Since each factor within a sentiment triplet could be a single word or a phrase, defining and implementing the span-level features for this span-level task is critical and challenging. However, prior works typically formulate the ASTE task as a sequence tagging problem and address it with token-level models, limiting the Cites: Adaptive recursive neural network for target-dependent twitter
