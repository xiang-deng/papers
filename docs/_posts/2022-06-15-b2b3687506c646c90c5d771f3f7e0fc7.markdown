Nowadays, more and more researchers are committed to applying artificial intelligence technology to the legal field to support decision-making. Charge prediction is a subtask of legal judgment prediction (LJP). Its purpose is to analyze the fact description of natural language text and predict a charge corresponding to a case. At present, most of the research takes charge prediction as a multiclass classification task, which leads to unsatisfactory interpretation due to the weak  Cites: CPT: Colorful Prompt Tuning for Pre-trained Vision-Language
