Nonfactoid question answering (QA) is one of the most extensive yet challenging applications and research areas in natural language processing (NLP). Existing methods fall short of handling the long-distance and complex semantic relations between the question and the document sentences. In this work, we propose a novel query-focused summarization method, namely a graph-enhanced multihop query-focused summarizer (GMQS), to tackle the nonfactoid QA problem. Specifically, we Cites: WikiQA: A challenge dataset for open-domain question answering
