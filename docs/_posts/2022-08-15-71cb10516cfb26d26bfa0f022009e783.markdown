The mixture of Gaussian processes (MGP) is a powerful model, which is able to characterize data generated by a general stochastic process. However, conventional MGPs assume the input variable obeys certain probabilistic distribution, thus cannot effectively handle the case where the input variable lies on a general manifold or a graph. In this paper, we first clarify the relationship between the MGP prediction strategy and the attention mechanism. Based on the attention mechanism, we further Cites: Hard-Coded Gaussian Attention for Neural Machine Translation
