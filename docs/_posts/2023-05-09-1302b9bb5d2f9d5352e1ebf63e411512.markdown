Large-scale open-domain dialogue data crawled from public social media has greatly improved the performance of dialogue models. However, long-turn dialogues are still highly scarce. Specifically, most dialogue sessions in existing corpora have less than three turns. To alleviate this issue, we propose the Retrieve, Reorganize and Rescale framework (Re $^ 3$ Dial), which can automatically construct a billion-scale long-turn dialogue corpus from existing short-turn dialogue data.
