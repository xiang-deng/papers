The development of deep neural networks and the emergence of pre-trained language models such as BERT allow to increase performance on many NLP tasks. However, these models do not meet the same popularity for tweet stream summarization, which is probably due to the fact that their computation limitation requires to drastically truncate the textual input. Our contribution in this article is threefold:(1) we propose a neural model to automatically and incrementally  Cites: GSum: A general framework for guided neural abstractive
