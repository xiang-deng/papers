Despite the significant advances achieved in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), their design process remains notoriously tedious, depending primarily on intuition, experience and trial-and-error. This human-dependent process is often time-consuming and prone to errors. Furthermore, the models are generally bound to their training contexts, with no considerations of changes to their surrounding environments. Continual adaptability and automation of neural networks is of  Cites: Continual and Multi-Task Architecture Search
