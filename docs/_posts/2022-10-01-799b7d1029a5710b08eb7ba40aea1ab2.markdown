Adding memory to artificial intelligence systems in an effective way has been addressed by researchers for many years. Recurrent neural networks and long short-term memories (LSTMs), among other neural network systems, have some inherent memory capabilities. Recently, in memory augmented neural networks, such as neural Turing machine (NTM) and its variants, a separate memory module is implemented, which can be accessed via read and write heads.
