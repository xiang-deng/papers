This chapter describes recent advances in the use of machine learning techniques in reactive atomistic simulations. In particular, it provides an overview of techniques used in training force fields with closed form potentials, developing machine-learning-based potentials, use of machine learning in accelerating the simulation process, and analytics techniques for drawing insights from simulation results. The chapter covers basic machine learning techniques, training procedures and loss functions Cites: Dynet: The dynamic neural network toolkit
