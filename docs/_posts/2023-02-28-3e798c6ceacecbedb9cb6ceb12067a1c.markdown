Automatically identifying the degree of semantic similarity between two small pieces of text has grown in importance recently. Its impact on various computer-related domains and recent breakthroughs in neural computation has increased the opportunities for better solutions to be developed. This work contributes a neurofuzzy approach for semantic textual similarity that uses neural networks and fuzzy logics. The idea is to combine the capabilities of the deep neural models for working with …
