Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective tools for graph representation learning. Most GNNs rely on a recursive neighborhood aggregation scheme, named message passing. In this paper, motivated by the success of retrieval-based models, we propose a non-parametric scheme called GraphRetrieval, in which similar training graphs associated with their ground-truth labels are retrieved to be jointly utilized with the input graph representation to complete various graph-based predictive  Cites: Retrieval augmented language model pre-training
