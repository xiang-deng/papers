User-generated social media data is constantly changing as new trends influence online discussion, causing distribution shift in test data for social media NLP applications. In addition, training data is often subject to change as user data is deleted. Most current NLP systems are static and rely on fixed training data. As a result, they are unable to adapt to temporal change--both test distribution shift and deleted training data--without frequent, costly re-training. In this paper, we study  Cites: REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training
