Due to the complex and diverse structure of the portrait boundary, it is a great challenge to segment the portrait from the natural background efficiently and accurately. We propose a new lightweight real-time semantic segmentation network-DDCNet, for portrait segmentation in complex background. Firstly, we propose a deformable depthwise separable convolution block, which combines deformable convolution with depthwise separable convolution, so that the network can fully  Cites: Espnet: Efficient spatial pyramid of dilated convolutions for
