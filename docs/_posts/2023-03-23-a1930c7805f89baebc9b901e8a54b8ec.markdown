Machine learning approaches have been introduced to support criminal investigations in recent years. In criminal investigations, Criminal acts may be similar, and similar incidents may occur consecutively by the same offender or by the same criminal group. Among the various machine learning algorithms, network-based algorithms will be suitable to reflect such associations. In general, however, inference by network-based algorithms is slow when the size of data is large, so it is …
