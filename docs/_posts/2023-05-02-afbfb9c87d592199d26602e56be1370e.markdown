The limited scale of annotated data constraints existing context-dependent text-to-SQL models because of the complexity of labeling. The data augmentation method is a commonly used method to solve this problem. However, the data generated by current augmentation methods often lack diversity. In this paper, we introduce ConDA, which generates interactive questions and corresponding SQL results. We designed the SQL dialogue state to enhance the data diversity through the state …
