Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a fine-grained classification task in natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a new framework with reinforcement learning agent to assess the importance of words in the sentence for sentiment analysis and mask out insignificant ones. Our method emphasizes on local linguistic understanding and extracts aspect-agnostic background information as well as aspect-relevant information. Experiments on three common datasets show that the Cites: Adaptive recursive neural network for target-dependent twitter
