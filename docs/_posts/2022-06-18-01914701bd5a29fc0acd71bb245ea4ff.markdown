For models to generalize under unseen domains (aka domain generalization), it is crucial to learn feature representations that are domain-agnostic and capture the underlying semantics that makes up an object category. Recent advances towards weakly supervised vision-language models that learn holistic representations from cheap weakly supervised noisy text annotations have shown their ability on semantic understanding by capturing object characteristics that generalize under different Cites: Vinvl: Making visual representations matter in vision-language
