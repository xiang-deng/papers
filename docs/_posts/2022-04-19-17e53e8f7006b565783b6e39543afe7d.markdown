Recent years witnessed several advances in developing multi-goal conversational recommender systems (MG-CRS) that can proactively attract users  interests and naturally lead user-engaged dialogues with multiple conversational goals and diverse topics. Four tasks are often involved in MG-CRS, including Goal Planning, Topic Prediction, Item Recommendation, and Response Generation. Most existing studies address only some of these tasks. To handle the whole problem of MG-CRS Cites: Pre-train, prompt, and predict: A systematic survey of prompting
