Extractive summarization systems are known to produce poorly coherent and, if not accounted for, highly redundant text. In this work, we tackle the problem of summary redundancy in unsupervised extractive summarization of long, highly-redundant documents. For this, we leverage a psycholinguistic theory of human reading comprehension which directly models local coherence and redundancy. Implementing this theory, our system operates at the proposition level and exploits Cites: Aspect-controllable opinion summarization
