We propose a Gaussian manifold variational auto-encoder (GM-VAE) whose latent space consists of a set of diagonal Gaussian distributions. It is known that the set of the diagonal Gaussian distributions with the Fisher information metric forms a product hyperbolic space, which we call a Gaussian manifold. To learn the VAE endowed with the Gaussian manifold, we first propose a pseudo Gaussian manifold normal distribution based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, a local approximation  Cites: Fully Hyperbolic Neural Networks
