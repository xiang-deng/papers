In neural circuits, synapses influence neurons by shaping network dynamics, and neurons influence synapses through activity-dependent plasticity. Motivated by this fact, we study a network model in which neurons and synapses are mutually coupled dynamic variables. Model neurons obey dynamics shaped by synaptic couplings that fluctuate, in turn, about quenched random strengths in response to pre-and postsynaptic neuronal activity. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we compute the Cites: What learning algorithm is in-context learning? investigations with
