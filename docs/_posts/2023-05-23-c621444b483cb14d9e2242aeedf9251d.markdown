Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment classification task, which identifies the sentiment polarity of a specific aspect in a sentence. In general, the syntactic dependency and semantic information between aspects and their contexts are modeled using deep neural networks. However, most of the existing methods treat specific aspects in a sentence independently, while ignoring the sentiment relationships between multiple aspects. In this work, we propose an …
