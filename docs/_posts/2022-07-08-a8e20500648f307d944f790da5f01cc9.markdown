We study the problem of cross-modality person re-identification (ReID) and tracking with dual visible-infrared (VI) cameras, while most exsiting efforts on tracking-by-detection have been paid on single-modality visible ReID which are inapplicable for poor-light environments. The major difficulties for cross-modaltiy (eg, visible-infrared) ReID stem from the large modality gap between three-channel visible images and one-channel infrared images and such unknown environmental factors as  Cites: Oscar: Object-semantics aligned pre-training for vision-language
