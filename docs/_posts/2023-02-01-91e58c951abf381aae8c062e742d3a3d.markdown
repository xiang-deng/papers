Most knowledge graph completion methods focus on predicting existing relationships in the knowledge graph but cannot predict unseen relationships. To solve this problem, knowledge graph zero-shot relational learning (KGZSL) has gotten more and more attention in recent years. The common method of KGZSL is to leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to build the connection between existing relation descriptions and knowledge graph domains. However, the …
