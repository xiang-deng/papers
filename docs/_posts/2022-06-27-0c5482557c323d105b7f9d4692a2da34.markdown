Recently, animal pose estimation is attracting increasing interest from the academia (eg, wildlife and conservation biology) focusing on animal behavior understanding. However, currently animal pose estimation suffers from small datasets and large data variances, making it difficult to obtain robust performance. To tackle this problem, we propose that the rich knowledge about relations between pose-related semantics learned by language models can be utilized to improve the animal pose estimation …
