Electronic health record (EHR) data are sparse and irregular as they are recorded at irregular time intervals, and different clinical variables are measured at each observation point. In this work, to handle irregular multivariate time-series data, we consider the human knowledge of the aspects to be measured and time to measure them in different situations, known as multi-view features, which are indirectly represented in the data. We propose a scheme to realize multi-view features Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
