From a bird s eye point of view, large-scale data analytics workflows, eg, those executed in popular tools, such as Apache Spark and Flink, are typically represented by directed acyclic graphs. Also, they are in a large scale in two dimensions: first, they are capable of processing big data (eg, both in terms of volume and velocity) mainly through employing massive parallelism, and second, they can run over (powerful) distributed infrastructures.
