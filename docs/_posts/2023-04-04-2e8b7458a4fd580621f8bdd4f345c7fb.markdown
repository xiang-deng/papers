Conventional optimization methods in machine learning and controls rely heavily on first-order update rules. Selecting the right method and hyperparameters for a particular task often involves trial-and-error or practitioner intuition, motivating the field of meta-learning. We generalize a broad family of preexisting update rules by proposing a meta-learning framework in which the inner loop optimization step involves solving a differentiable convex optimization (DCO). We illustrate the  Cites: Generalized inner loop meta-learning
