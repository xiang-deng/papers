We propose a self-supervised embedding learning framework—SelfLinKG—to link concepts in heterogeneous knowledge graphs. Without any labeled data, SelfLinKG can achieve competitive performance against its supervised counterpart, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by 26%-50% under linear classification protocol. The essential components of SelfLinKG are local attention-based encoding and momentum contrastive learning. The former aims to …
