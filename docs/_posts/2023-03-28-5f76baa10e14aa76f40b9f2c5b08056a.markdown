Fine-grained or aspect-level sentiment classification (ALSC) has attracted considerable attention from natural language processing experts and researchers in recent years. The focus of research in this area is on the development of efficient deep learning techniques which aim to correctly detect the polarity of sentiments of aspects of a product or service that are important to customers. Many of the deep learning methods perform well but are computationally costly. Thus, there is a need  Cites: Aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network
