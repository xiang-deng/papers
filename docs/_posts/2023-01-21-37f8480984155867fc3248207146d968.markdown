In-context learning (ICL) is a type of prompting where a transformer model operates on a sequence of (input, output) examples and performs inference on-the-fly. This implicit training is in contrast to explicitly tuning the model weights based on examples. In this work, we formalize in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem, treating the transformer model as a learning algorithm that can be specialized via training to implement-at inference-time-another target algorithm. We  Cites: What can transformers learn in-context? a case study of simple
