Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a new state-of-the-art for learning knowledge graph representations. Although they have shown impressive performance in recent studies, how to efficiently and effectively aggregate neighboring features is not well designed. To tackle this challenge, we propose the simplifying heterogeneous graph neural network (SHGNet), a generic framework that discards the two standard operations in GNN, including the transformation matrix and …
