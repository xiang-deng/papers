To reduce human annotations for relation extraction (RE) tasks, distantly supervised approaches have been proposed, while struggling with low performance. In this work, we propose a novel DSRE-NLI framework, which considers both distant supervision from existing knowledge bases and indirect supervision from pretrained language models for other tasks. DSRE-NLI energizes an off-the-shelf natural language inference (NLI) engine with a semi-automatic relation verbalization (SARV) Cites: Zero-shot relation extraction via reading comprehension
