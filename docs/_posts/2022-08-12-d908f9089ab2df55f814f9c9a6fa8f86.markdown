This survey reviews explainability methods for vision-based self-driving systems trained with behavior cloning. The concept of explainability has several facets and the need for explainability is strong in driving, a safety-critical application. Gathering contributions from several research fields, namely computer vision, deep learning, autonomous driving, explainable AI (X-AI), this survey tackles several points. First, it discusses definitions, context, and motivation for gaining more interpretability and Cites: From recognition to cognition: Visual commonsense reasoning
