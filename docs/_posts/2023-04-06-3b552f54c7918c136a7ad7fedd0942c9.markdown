The computer-aided design (CAD) models contain abundant domain knowledge, either structure, material, or process information. An efficient retrieval ability for these reusable design resources will provide designers invaluable support for efficient product development. With this goal, this paper proposed a novel CAD model retrieval framework based on correlation network and relevance ranking. First, a multi-layer network was constructed to express the high-level local correlation …
