This paper revisits visual representation in knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA) and demonstrates that using regional information in a better way can significantly improve the performance. While visual representation is extensively studied in traditional VQA, it is under-explored in knowledge-based VQA even though these two tasks share the common spirit, ie, rely on visual input to answer the question. Specifically, we observe that in most state-of-the-art knowledge-based VQA …
