In recent years, dense retrieval has emerged as the primary method for open-domain question-answering (OpenQA). However, previous research often focused on the query side, neglecting the importance of the passage side. We believe that both the query and passage sides are equally important and should be considered for improved OpenQA performance. In this paper, we propose a contrastive pseudo-labeled data constructed around passages and queries separately. We employ an …
