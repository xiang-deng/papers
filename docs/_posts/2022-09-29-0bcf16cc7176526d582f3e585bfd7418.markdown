Abstract Knowledge graph embedding aims to learn representations of entities and relations in a knowledge graph. Recently, QuatE has introduced the graph embeddings into the quaternion space. However, there are still challenges in dealing with complex patterns, including 1-N, N-1, and multiple-relations between two entities. Since the learned entity embeddings tend to overlap with each other in the first two cases, and the learned relation embeddings tend to overlap with each other …
