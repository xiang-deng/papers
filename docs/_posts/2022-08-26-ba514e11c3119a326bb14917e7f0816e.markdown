Privacy and security challenges in Machine Learning (ML) have become a critical topic to address, along with ML s pervasive development and the recent demonstration of large attack surfaces. As a mature system-oriented approach, confidential computing has been increasingly utilized in both academia and industry to improve privacy and security in various ML scenarios. In this paper, we systematize the findings on confidential computing-assisted ML security and privacy Cites: Unsupervised data augmentation for consistency training
