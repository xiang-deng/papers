Trying to capture the sample-label relationship, conditional generative models often end up inheriting the spurious correlation in the training dataset, giving label-conditional distributions that are severely imbalanced in another latent attribute. To mitigate such undesirable correlations engraved into generative models, which we call spurious causality, we propose a general two-step strategy.(a) Fairness Intervention (FI): Emphasize the minority samples that are hard to be generated due Cites: Just train twice: Improving group robustness without training group
