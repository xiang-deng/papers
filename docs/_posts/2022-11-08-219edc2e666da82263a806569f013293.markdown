According to some estimates, every hour, Sun provides planet Earth with more energy than humankind consumes in a whole year. Part of this energy has been essential to ensure living conditions (warmth and food production, for instance) and, more recently, to generate electricity by means of atmospheric (aeolian) and/or geographical (hydropower) sources. In addition to these, the direct (photovoltaic PV) conversion of solar radiation into electricity represents a very elegant method of …
