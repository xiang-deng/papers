Traditional end-to-end instruction following approaches for robotic manipulation are notoriously sample inefficient and lack adaptivity; for most single-turn methods, there is no way to provide additional language supervision to adapt robot behavior online–a property critical to deploying robots in collaborative, safety-critical environments. In this work, we present a method for incorporating language corrections, built on the insight that an initial instruction and subsequent corrections differ mainly in the … Cites: ‪Vision-and-dialog navigation‬
