Words of estimative probability (WEP) are expressions of a statement s plausibility (probably, maybe, likely, doubt, likely, unlikely, impossible...). Multiple surveys demonstrate the agreement of human evaluators when assigning numerical probability levels to WEP. For example, highly likely corresponds to a median chance of 0.90+-0.08 in Fagen-Ulmschneider (2015) s survey. In this work, we measure the ability of neural language processing models to capture the consensual probability  Cites: Beyond the Imitation Game: Quantifying and extrapolating the
