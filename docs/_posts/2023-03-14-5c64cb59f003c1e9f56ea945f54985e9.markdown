In recent years, Question-answering systems are extensively used in human-computer systems, and the accuracy rate on a large scale is increasing. However, in actual deployment, a large number of parameters are often accompanied by a large amount of memory and long-term processing requirements. Therefore, compressing the data of the model, reducing training time, memory, becomes more and more urgent. we aim to resolve issues: IDS-Extract dynamically sized data to support  Cites: Neurips 2020 efficientqa competition: Systems, analyses and
