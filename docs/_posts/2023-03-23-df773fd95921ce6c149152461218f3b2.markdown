Classification models learn to generalize the associations between data samples and their target classes. However, researchers have increasingly observed that machine learning practice easily leads to systematic errors in AI applications, a phenomenon referred to as AI blindspots. Such blindspots arise when a model is trained with training samples (eg, cat/dog classification) where important patterns (eg, black cats) are missing or periphery/undesirable patterns (eg, dogs with grass …
