This paper puts forth an aerial edge Internet-of-Things (EdgeIoT) system, where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is employed as a mobile edge server to process mission-critical computation tasks of ground Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. When the UAV schedules an IoT device to offload its computation task, the tasks buffered at the other unselected devices could be outdated and have to be cancelled. We investigate a new joint optimization of UAV cruise control and task offloading …
