In this work, we study recent advances in context-sensitive language models for the task of query expansion. We study the behavior of existing and new approaches for lexical word-based expansion in both unsupervised and supervised contexts. For unsupervised models, we study the behavior of the Contextualized Embeddings for Query Expansion (CEQE) model. We introduce a new model, Supervised Contextualized Query Expansion with Transformers (SQET) that performs expansion Cites: Document expansion by query prediction
