Integrating human knowledge into neural networks has the potential to improve their robustness and interpretability. We have developed a novel approach to integrate knowledge from ontologies into the structure of a Transformer network which we call ontology pre-training: we train the network to predict membership in ontology classes as a way to embed the structure of the ontology into the network, and subsequently fine-tune the network for the particular prediction task. We apply this approach to a …
