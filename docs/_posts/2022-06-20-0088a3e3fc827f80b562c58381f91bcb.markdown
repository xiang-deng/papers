Current practical use of machine learning is more involved than model architecture and the optimisation technique itself. It is very important that the modern machine learning method is supported with a robust set of tools for the creation and manipulation of data sets. ICHOR is one such tool designed for the purpose of creating fast and accurate atomistic Gaussian process regression (GPR) models through the use of active learning. ICHOR operates in the context of FFLUX, a fully  Cites: AlphaD3M: Machine learning pipeline synthesis
