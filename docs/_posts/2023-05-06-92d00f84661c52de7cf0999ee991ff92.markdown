Automatic target recognition and detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is playing a significant role in military and civilian fields. Traditional methods are weak in migration capabilities and cumbersome in manual design. Existing deep learning-based methods can achieve high recognition and detection accuracy, but most of them have a very large number of parameters and slow recognition and computational efficiency, which makes it difficult for them to migrate to edge Cites: Efficientnetv2: Smaller models and faster training
