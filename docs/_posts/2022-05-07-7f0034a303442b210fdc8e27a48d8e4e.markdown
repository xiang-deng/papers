To speed up the efficiency of software development, the ability to retrieve codes through natural language is fundamental. At present, the approach of code search based on deep learning has been extensively researched and achieved a lot of results. However, these models are much complex and the training relies on artificially extracted features. Different from other deep learning models, we simulate people s reading habit of expanding content first and then refining content when Cites: Learning to mine aligned code and natural language pairs from
