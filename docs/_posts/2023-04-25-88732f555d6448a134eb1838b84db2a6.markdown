Abstract Machine learning, especially deep learning, has been highly successful in data-intensive applications, however, the performance of these models will drop significantly when the amount of the training data amount does not meet the requirement. This leads to the so-called Few-Shot Learning (FSL) problem, which requires the model rapidly generalize to new tasks that containing only a few labeled samples. In this paper, we proposed a new deep model, called deep convolutional  Cites: Rethinking pre-training and self-training
