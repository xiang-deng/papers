The interpretability of deep neural networks has aroused widespread concern in the academic and industrial fields. This paper proposes a new method named the dynamic reasoning and information bottleneck (DRIB) to improve human interpretability and understandability. In the method, a novel dynamic reasoning decision algorithm was proposed to reduce multiply accumulate operations and improve the interpretability of the calculation. The information bottleneck was Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
