Abstract Deep Neural Networks such as Recurrent Neural Networks and Transformer models are widely adopted for their superior performance in many natural language processing (NLP) applications, but they remain largely black-box which can lead to unwanted bias and unrobust behaviors. To discover, diagnose and evaluate these issues, it is essential to make NLP systems accountable, reliable and most importantly, explainable. Explainability tools and methods can be leveraged by NLP  Cites: Well-Read Students Learn Better: On the Importance of Pre
