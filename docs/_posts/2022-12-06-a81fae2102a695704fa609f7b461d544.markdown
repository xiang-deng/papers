Despite recent successes with neural machine translation, even models trained on extensive parallel corpus data still perform poorly when applied to translating text from a different genre, so called “outof-domain” translation. This thesis investigates different methods that can be used to improve out-of-domain translations such as byte-pair encoding, sub-word regularization, beam size, label smoothing and domainadaptation. These techniques were applied to the training and fine-tuning …
