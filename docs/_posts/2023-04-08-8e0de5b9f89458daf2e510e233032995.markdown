In this work, we develop language models for the Sanskrit language, namely Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and its variants: A Lite BERT (ALBERT), and Robustly Optimized BERT (RoBERTa) using Devanagari Sanskrit text corpus. Then we extracted the features for the given text from these models. We applied the dimensional reduction and clustering techniques on the features to generate an extractive summary for a given Sanskrit document.
