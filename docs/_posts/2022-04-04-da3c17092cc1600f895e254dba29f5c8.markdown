Understanding users  requirements are essential to developing an effective AI service system, in which requirement expressions of users can be resolved into intent detection and slot filling tasks. In a lot of literature, the two tasks are normally considered as independent tasks and obtain satisfactory performance. Recently, many researchers have found that intent detection and slot filling can benefit each other since they always appear together in a sentence and may include shared Cites: Joint semantic utterance classification and slot filling with recursive
