Sparsely-activated neural networks with conditional computation learn to route their inputs through different subnetworks, providing a strong structural prior and reducing computational costs. Despite their possible benefits, models with learned routing often underperform their parameter-matched densely-activated counterparts as well as models that use non-learned heuristic routing strategies. In this paper, we hypothesize that these shortcomings stem from the gradient estimation techniques …
