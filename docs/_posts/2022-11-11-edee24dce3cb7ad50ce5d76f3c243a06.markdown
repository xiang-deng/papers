Despite recent advancements in tabular language model research, real-world applications are still challenging. In industry, there is an abundance of tables found in spreadsheets, but acquisition of substantial amounts of labels is expensive, since only experts can annotate the often highly technical and domain-specific tables. Active learning could potentially reduce labeling costs, however, so far there are no works related to active learning in conjunction with tabular language models.
