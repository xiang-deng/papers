Neural document retrievers, including dense passage retrieval (DPR), have outperformed classical lexical-matching retrievers, such as BM25, when fine-tuned and tested on specific question-answering datasets. However, it has been shown that the existing dense retrievers do not generalize well not only out of domain but even in domain such as Wikipedia, especially when a named entity in a question is a dominant clue for retrieval. In this paper, we propose an approach toward in-domain …
