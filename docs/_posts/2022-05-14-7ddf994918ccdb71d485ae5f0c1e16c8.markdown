Adaptive navigation is the core of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) conducting autonomous flights in diverse environments. Different navigation techniques are adopted according to the availability of navigation signals in the environment. MAVs must navigate using scene recognition technology to ensure the continuity and reliability of the flight. Therefore, our work investigated the scene recognition method for MAV environment-adaptive navigation. First, we exploited the functional Cites: Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for
