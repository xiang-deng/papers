Image Captioning (IC) has achieved astonishing developments by incorporating various techniques into the CNN-RNN encoder-decoder architecture. However, since CNN and RNN do not share the basic network component, such a heterogeneous pipeline is hard to be trained end-to-end where the visual encoder will not learn anything from the caption supervision. This drawback inspires the researchers to develop a homogeneous architecture that facilitates end-to-end Cites: Oscar: Object-semantics aligned pre-training for vision-language
