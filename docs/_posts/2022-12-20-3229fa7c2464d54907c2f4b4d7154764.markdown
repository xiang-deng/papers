Workflow synthesis is important for automatically creating the data processing workflow in a FAIR data management system for HPC. Previous methods are table-based, rigid and not scalable. This paper addresses these limitations by developing a new approach to workflow synthesis, interactive NLU-powered ontology-based workflow synthesis (INPOWS). INPOWS allows the use of Natural Language for queries, maximizes the robustness in handling concepts and language ambiguities …
