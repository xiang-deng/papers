We present CompoSuite, an open-source simulated robotic manipulation benchmark for compositional multi-task reinforcement learning (RL). Each CompoSuite task requires a particular robot arm to manipulate one individual object to achieve a task objective while avoiding an obstacle. This compositional definition of the tasks endows CompoSuite with two remarkable properties. First, varying the robot/object/objective/obstacle elements leads to hundreds of RL tasks, each of which requires a Cites: Compositional attention networks for machine reasoning
