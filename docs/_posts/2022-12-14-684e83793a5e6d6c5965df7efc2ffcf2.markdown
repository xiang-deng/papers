Machine learning models have been found to learn shortcuts--unintended decision rules that are unable to generalize--undermining models reliability. Previous works address this problem under the tenuous assumption that only a single shortcut exists in the training data. Real-world images are rife with multiple visual cues from background to texture. Key to advancing the reliability of vision systems is understanding whether existing methods can overcome multiple shortcuts or struggle Cites: Just train twice: Improving group robustness without training group
