Designing a query-efficient model extraction strategy to steal models from cloud-based platforms with black-box constraints remains a challenge, especially for language models. In a more realistic setting, a lack of information about the target model s internal parameters, gradients, training data, or even confidence scores prevents attackers from easily copying the target model. Selecting informative and useful examples to train a substitute model is critical to query-efficient model stealing …
