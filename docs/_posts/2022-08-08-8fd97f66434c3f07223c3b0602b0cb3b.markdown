Trustworthy machine learning is of primary importance to the practical deployment of deep learning models. While state-of-the-art models achieve astonishingly good performance in terms of accuracy, recent literature reveals that their predictive confidence scores unfortunately cannot be trusted: eg, they are often overconfident when wrong predictions are made, or so even for obvious outliers. In this paper, we introduce a new approach of self-supervised probing, which enables us to check and Cites: Designing and interpreting probes with control tasks
