With the development of information technology, radio communication technology has made rapid progress. Many radio signals that have appeared in space are difficult to classify without manually labeling. Unsupervised radio signal clustering methods have recently become an urgent need for this situation. Meanwhile, the high complexity of deep learning makes it difficult to understand the decision results of the clustering models, making it essential to conduct interpretable analysis.
