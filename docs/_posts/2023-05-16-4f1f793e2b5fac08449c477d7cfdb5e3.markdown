Context-dependent Text-to-SQL aims to translate multi-turn natural language questions into SQL queries. Despite various methods have exploited context-dependence information implicitly for contextual SQL parsing, there are few attempts to explicitly address the dependencies between current question and question context. This paper presents QURG, a novel Question Rewriting Guided approach to help the models achieve adequate contextual understanding. Specifically, we first  Cites: Few-Shot Generative Conversational Query Rewriting
