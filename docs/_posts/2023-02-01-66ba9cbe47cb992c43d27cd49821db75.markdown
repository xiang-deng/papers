Answering complex queries on incomplete knowledge graphs is a challenging task where a model needs to answer complex logical queries in the presence of missing knowledge. Recently, Arakelyan et al.(2021); Minervini et al.(2022) showed that neural link predictors could also be used for answering complex queries: their Continuous Query Decomposition (CQD) method works by decomposing complex queries into atomic sub-queries, answers them using neural link predictors and …
