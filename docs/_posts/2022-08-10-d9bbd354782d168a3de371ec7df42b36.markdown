Since out-of-distribution generalization is a generally ill-posed problem, various proxy targets (eg, calibration, adversarial robustness, algorithmic corruptions, invariance across shifts) were studied across different research programs resulting in different recommendations. While sharing the same aspirational goal, these approaches have never been tested under the same experimental conditions on real data. In this paper, we take a unified view of previous work, highlighting message Cites: Accuracy on the line: on the strong correlation between out-of
