Knowledge graphs (KGs) are key tools in many AI-related tasks such as reasoning or question answering. This has, in turn, propelled research in link prediction in KGs, the task of predicting missing relationships from the available knowledge. Solutions based on KG embeddings have shown promising results in this matter. On the downside, these approaches are usually unable to explain their predictions. While some works have proposed to compute post-hoc rule explanations for embedding …
