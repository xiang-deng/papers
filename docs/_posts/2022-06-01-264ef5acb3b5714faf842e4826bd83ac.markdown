Voices and faces play pivotal roles in our social interactions. Despite their different physical manifestations, voices and faces contain highly similar types of information, including linguistic information (phonemes for voice and viseme for faces), affective state, and identity characteristics (weight, gender, age, etc.). For this reason, the associations between voices and faces have gathered significant research interest in psychology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and many other fields.
