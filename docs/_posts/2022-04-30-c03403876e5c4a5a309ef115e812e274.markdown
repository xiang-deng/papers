ABSTRACT Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial natural language understanding task for many down-stream tasks such as question answering and retrieval. Despite significant progress in developing NER models for multiple languages and domains, scaling to emerging and/or low-resource domains still remains challenging, due to the costly nature of acquiring training data. We propose CycleNER, an unsupervised approach based on cycle-consistency training that uses Cites: Unsupervised named-entity extraction from the web: An
