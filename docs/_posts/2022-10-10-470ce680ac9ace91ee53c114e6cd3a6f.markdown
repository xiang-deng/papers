Such human-assisting systems as robots need to correctly understand the surrounding situation based on observations and output the required support actions for humans. Language is one of the important channels to communicate with humans, and the robots are required to have the ability to express their understanding and action planning results. In this study, we propose a new task of operative action captioning that estimates and verbalizes the actions to be taken by  Cites: FixMyPose: Pose Correctional Captioning and Retrieval
