This dissertation examines reasoning and inference over semi-structured tabular text, specifically entity-centric InfoBox tables (cf. Figure 1). Semi-structured tabular text is widespread and involves comprehension of the meaning of text fragments and implicit relationships between them. The dissertation argues that semi-structured data can serve as a crucial testing ground for increasing the understanding of how Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to reason about information.
