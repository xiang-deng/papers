IT industry has been thriving over the past decades. Numerous new programming languages have emerged, new architectural patterns and software development techniques. Tools involved in the process ought to evolve as well. One of the key principles of new generation of instruments for software development would be the ability of the tools to learn using neural networks. First of all, it is necessary for the tools to learn how to write code. In this work we study the ability of Transformers to  Cites: MCoNaLa: A Benchmark for Code Generation from Multiple
