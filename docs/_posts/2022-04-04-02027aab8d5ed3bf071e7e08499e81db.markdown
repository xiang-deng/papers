ABSTRACT Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) have made automatic code generation possible for real-world programming tasks in general- purpose programming languages such as Python. However, there are few human studies on the usability of these tools and how they fit the programming workflow. In this work, we conducted a within-subjects user study with 24 participants to understand how programmers use and perceive Copilot, a LLM-based code Cites: Incorporating external knowledge through pre-training for natural
