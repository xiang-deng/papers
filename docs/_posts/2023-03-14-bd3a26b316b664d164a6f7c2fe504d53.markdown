A rigorous formalization of desired system requirements is indispensable when performing any verification task. This often limits the application of verification techniques, as writing formal specifications is an error-prone and time-consuming manual task. To facilitate this, we present nl2spec, a framework for applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive formal specifications (in temporal logics) from unstructured natural language. In particular, we introduce a new methodology to Cites: Chain of thought prompting elicits reasoning in large language
