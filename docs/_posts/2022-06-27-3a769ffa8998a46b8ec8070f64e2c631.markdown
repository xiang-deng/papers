Program Synthesis is a challenging problem in Artificial Intelligence. An important element of a program synthesizer is the objective function that guides the combinatorial search for a program that satisfies a given user intent. Given multiple I/O example transformations that correspond to the intended behavior of the program, this function evaluates the performance of a generated program based on the distance of its output to the correct output. In this study, we consider the possibility of
