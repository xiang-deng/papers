Do all instances need inference through the big models for a correct prediction? Perhaps not; some instances are easy and can be answered correctly by even small capacity models. This provides opportunities for improving the computational efficiency of systems. In this work, we present an explorative study on model cascading , a simple technique that utilizes a collection of models of varying capacities to accurately yet efficiently output predictions.
