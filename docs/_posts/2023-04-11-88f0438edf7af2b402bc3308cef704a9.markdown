Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) plays a critical role in the carbon and biogeochemical cycles within aquatic ecosystems. Satellite imagery can be employed to determine aquatic CDOM concentrations, highlighting the need for effective and precise algorithms for this task. In this study, a cruise survey dataset containing CDOM absorption coefficients and water-leaving radiances in the Pearl River estuary (PRE) was utilized to develop machine learning algorithms for CDOM Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
