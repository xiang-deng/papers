Recently, supervised abstractive summarization using high-resource datasets, such as CNN/DailyMail and Xsum, has achieved significant performance improvements. However, most of the existing high-resource dataset is biased towards a specific domain like news, and annotating document-summary pairs for low-resource datasets is too expensive. Furthermore, the need for low-resource abstractive summarization task is emerging but existing methods for the task such as transfer …
