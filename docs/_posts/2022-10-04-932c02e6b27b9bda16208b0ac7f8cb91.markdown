In reasoning about sequential events it is natural to pose probabilistic queries such as when will event A occur next or what is the probability of A occurring before B, with applications in areas such as user modeling, medicine, and finance. However, with machine learning shifting towards neural autoregressive models such as RNNs and transformers, probabilistic querying has been largely restricted to simple cases such as next-event prediction. This is in part due to the fact that future querying  Cites: Massive-scale Decoding for Text Generation using Lattices
