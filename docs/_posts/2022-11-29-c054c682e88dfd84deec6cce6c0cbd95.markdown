Community detection is a crucial task on the research field of network analysis. However, this task recently has become challenging due to the explosion of network in terms of the scale and the side information, eg, temporal information and attribute information. Here we propose PGMTANa probabilistic generative model for overlapping community detection on temporal dual-attributed networks. PGMTAN aims to characterize four generation processes: 1) generation of occurrence of the  Cites: A unified framework for community detection and network
