Deep learning techniques have recently demonstrated exceptional performance when used for Power Quality Disturbance (PQD) classification. However, a practical obstacle is that power system professionals do not fully trust the outputs of these techniques, if they cannot understand the reasons for their decisions. Meanwhile, in the last couple of years Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques have been used to improve the explainability of machine learning models, in order to make their  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
