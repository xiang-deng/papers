In recent years, large language models have been processing an ever increasing amount of human-generated data. This has led to the development of neural models of language such as GloVe [44], BERT [14], GPT-2 [45], XLNet [64] or GPT-3 [37] that have come to play a transformative role in several applications of societal relevance. The concept of foundation models [3, 48] has been proposed to suggest that future computational systems will be built on top of such general purpose language models Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
