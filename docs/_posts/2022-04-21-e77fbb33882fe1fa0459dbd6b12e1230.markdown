In living-donor liver transplantation, the safety of the donor is critical. In addition, accurately measuring the liver volume is significant as the amount that can be resected from living donors is limited. In this paper, we propose an automated segmentation and volume estimation method for the liver in computed tomography imaging based on a deep learning-based segmentation network. Our framework was trained using the data of 191 donors, achieved a dice similarity coefficient of 0.789 Cites: Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate
