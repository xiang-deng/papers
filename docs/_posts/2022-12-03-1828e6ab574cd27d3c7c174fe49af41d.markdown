We aim at improving reasoning on inconsistent and uncertain data. We focus on knowledge-graph data, extended with time intervals to specify their validity, as regularly found in historical sciences. We propose principles on semantics for efficient Maximum A-Posteriori inference on the new Temporal Markov Logic Networks (TMLN) which extend the Markov Logic Networks (MLN) by uncertain temporal facts and rules. We examine total and partial temporal (in) consistency  Cites: Open information extraction from the web
