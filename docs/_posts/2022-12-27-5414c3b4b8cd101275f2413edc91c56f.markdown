Many natural language related applications involve text generation, created by humans or machines. While in many of those applications machines support humans, yet in few others,(eg adversarial machine learning, social bots and trolls) machines try to impersonate humans. In this scope, we proposed and evaluated several mutation-based text generation approaches. Unlike machine-based generated text, mutation-based generated text needs human text samples as inputs …
