Relation extraction is an important task in natural language processing.

Among various dependencies, the ISA is a relation that accounts for a relatively large proportion and is of great significance for many related tasks. However, there is currently little research on the ISA relation extraction between cross-chapter concepts for few-shot in textbooks.
