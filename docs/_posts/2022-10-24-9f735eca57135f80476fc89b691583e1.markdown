A framework of Genetic Algorithm-Support Vector Machine (GA-SVM) is proposed for SVM parameters (model) selection, and clustering algorithm is also integrated with the framework to generate multiple optimal models, as well as being condition of convergence for GA. Moreover, an ensemble method on various SVM models assisted by TRUST-TECH methodology is put forward, to enhance the generalization ability of a single SVM model. The performance of GA-SVM and ensemble method is  Cites: Leave-one-out bounds for support vector regression model selection
