We present GradMask, a simple adversarial example detection scheme for natural language processing (NLP) models. It uses gradient signals to detect adversarially perturbed tokens in an input sequence and occludes such tokens by a masking process. GradMask provides several advantages over existing methods including improved detection performance and an interpretation of its decision with a only moderate computational cost. Its approximated inference cost is no more than a Cites: Thieves on Sesame Street! Model Extraction of BERT-based APIs
