Large pre-trained models decay over long-term deployment as input distributions shift, user requirements change, or crucial knowledge gaps are discovered. Recently, model editors have been proposed to modify a model s behavior by adjusting its weights during deployment. However, when editing the same model multiple times, these approaches quickly decay a model s performance on upstream data and forget how to fix previous errors. We propose and study a novel Lifelong  Cites: Fine-tuning pretrained language models: Weight initializations
