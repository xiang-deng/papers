The graphical page object detection classifies and localizes objects such as Tables and Figures in a document. As deep learning techniques for object detection become increasingly successful, many supervised deep neural network-based methods have been introduced to recognize graphical objects in documents. However, these models necessitate a substantial amount of labeled data for the training process. This paper presents an end-to-end semi-supervised framework for graphical object  Cites: Unsupervised data augmentation for consistency training
