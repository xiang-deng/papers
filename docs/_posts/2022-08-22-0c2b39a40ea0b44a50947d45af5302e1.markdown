Our world is constantly evolving. Consequently, our languages, often said to mirror the world, are dynamic in nature. However, most current language representations are static. New words and semantic evolution have been shown to pose a crucial challenge in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) tasks, leading to a significant drop in the performance of modern language models. In this thesis, we create time-aware language models and representations Cites: How can we know what language models know?
