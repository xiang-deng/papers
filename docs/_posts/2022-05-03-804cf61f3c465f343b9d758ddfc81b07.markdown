Proteins perform many essential functions in biological systems and can be successfully developed as bio-therapeutics. It is invaluable to be able to predict their properties based on a proposed sequence and structure. In this study, we developed a novel generalizable deep learning framework, LM-GVP, composed of a protein Language Model (LM) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) to leverage information from both 1D amino acid sequences and 3D structures of proteins. Our approach Cites: Structure-based protein function prediction using graph
