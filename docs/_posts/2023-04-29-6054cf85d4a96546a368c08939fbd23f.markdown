The aim of this paper is to investigate the connection between learning trajectories of the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and their corresponding generalization capabilities when being optimized with broadly used gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent algorithms. In this paper, we construct Linear Approximation Function to model the trajectory information and we propose a new generalization bound with richer trajectory information based on it. Our proposed generalization Cites: Catastrophic fisher explosion: Early phase fisher matrix impacts
