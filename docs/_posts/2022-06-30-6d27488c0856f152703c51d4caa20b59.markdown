Characterizing the metabolic profile of a microbial community is crucial for understanding its biological function and its impact on the host or environment. Metabolomics experiments directly measuring these profiles are difficult and expensive, while sequencing methods quantifying the species composition of microbial communities are well-developed and relatively cost-effective. Computational methods that are capable of predicting metabolomic profiles from Cites: " Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any
