Semantic role labeling, sometimes referred to as shallow semantic parsing, is a task in Natural Language Processing that determines the labels of words or phrases (groups of words) in a sentence. Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is the process of identifying essential event structures in a sentence, such as who did what to whom, when, and where. Nowadays, the computational identification and labeling of arguments in text is a one of the important tasks in computational Cites: Jointly predicting predicates and arguments in neural semantic
