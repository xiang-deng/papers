Crops are constantly challenged by different environmental conditions. Seed treatment by nanomaterials is a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly solution for environmental stress mitigation in crop plants. Here, 56 seed nanopriming treatments are used to alleviate environmental stresses in maize. Seven selected nanopriming treatments significantly increase the stress resistance index (SRI) by 13.9% and 12.6% under salinity stress and combined heat-drought stress …
