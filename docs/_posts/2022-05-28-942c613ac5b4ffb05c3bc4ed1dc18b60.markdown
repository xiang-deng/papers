Current successes of machine learning architectures are based on computationally expensive algorithms and prohibitively large amounts of data. We need to develop tasks and data to train networks to reach more complex and more compositional skills. In this paper, we illustrate Blackbird s language matrices (BLMs), a novel grammatical dataset developed to test a linguistic variant of Raven s progressive matrices, an intelligence test usually based on visual stimuli. The dataset consists of  Cites: Disentangled Sequence to Sequence Learning for Compositional
