One-shot coreset selection aims to select a subset of the training data, given a pruning rate, that can achieve high accuracy for models that are subsequently trained only with that subset. State-of-the-art coreset selection methods typically assign an importance score to each example and select the most important examples to form a coreset. These methods perform well at low pruning rates; but at high pruning rates, they have been found to suffer a catastrophic accuracy drop …
