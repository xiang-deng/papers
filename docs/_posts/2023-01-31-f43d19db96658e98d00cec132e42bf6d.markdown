Multi-agent reinforcement learning typically suffers from the problem of sample inefficiency, where learning suitable policies involves the use of many data samples. Learning from external demonstrators is a possible solution that mitigates this problem. However, most prior approaches in this area assume the presence of a single demonstrator. Leveraging multiple knowledge sources (ie, advisors) with expertise in distinct aspects of the environment could substantially speed up learning Cites: Pommerman: A multi-agent playground
