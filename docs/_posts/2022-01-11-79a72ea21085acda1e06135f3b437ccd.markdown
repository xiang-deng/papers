Dense passage retrieval (DPR) models show great effectiveness gains in first stage retrieval for the web domain. However in the web domain we are in a setting with large amounts of training data and a query-to-passage or a query-to-document retrieval task. We investigate in this paper dense document-to-document retrieval with limited labelled target data for training, in particular legal case retrieval. In order to use DPR models for document-to-document retrieval, we propose a Paragraph Cites: Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering
