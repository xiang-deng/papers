The analysis of the tonality of texts is an urgent problem in the field of natural language processing, which is often solved with the help of convolutional neural networks. However, most of these CNN models focus only on the study of local functions, ignoring global features. In this paper, a hybrid convolutional neural network with parallel-sequential connections between layers and from the layer of maximum pulling obtained from the matrix of the original text is proposed for the Cites: A joint segmentation and classification framework for sentiment
