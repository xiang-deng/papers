Text summarization aims to generate a short summary for an input text and has extensive real-world applications such as headline generation. State-of-the-art summarization models are mainly supervised; they require large labeled training corpora and thus cannot be applied to less popular areas, eg, less spoken languages, where paired data are rare. In this thesis, I present a non-autoregressive unsupervised summarization model, which does not require parallel data for training …
