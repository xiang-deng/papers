As machine learning models become larger, and are increasingly trained on large and uncurated datasets in weakly supervised mode, it becomes important to establish mechanisms for inspecting, interacting with and revising models. These are necessary to mitigate shortcut learning effects and to guarantee that the model s learned knowledge is aligned with human knowledge. Recently, several explanatory interactive machine learning methods have been developed for this purpose, but Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
