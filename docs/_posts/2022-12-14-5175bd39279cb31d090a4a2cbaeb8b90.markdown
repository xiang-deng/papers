Multi-label classification is a challenging task, particularly in domains where the number of labels to be predicted is large. Deep neural networks are often effective at multi-label classification of images and textual data. When dealing with tabular data, however, conventional machine learning algorithms, such as tree ensembles, appear to outperform competition. Random forest, being a popular ensemble algorithm, has found use in a wide range of real-world problems. Such problems …
