ABSTRACT Sixth (6 th) Generation (6G) wireless communication proposes Non-Terrestrial aerial Network (NTN) architecture to support dynamic scaling of both coverage and capacity. In this paper, we discuss Low Altitude Platform (LAP) based aerial cell for NTN which augments the terrestrial cell through Dual Connectivity (DC) or Carrier Aggregation (CA) on an independent and non-interfering frequency carrier. The determination of an optimal trajectory for a LAP based aerial cell is  Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
