Abstract Reasoning is essential for the development of large temporal knowledge graphs, which aim to infer new facts based on existing ones. Recent temporal knowledge graph reasoning methods mainly embed timestamps into low-dimensional spaces. These methods focus on entity reasoning, which cannot obtain the specific reasoning paths. More importantly, they ignore the logic and explanation of reasoning paths in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs). To overcome this  Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
