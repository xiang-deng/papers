When there is a contingency in a major transmission system, it is crucial to locate and detect abnormal parameters using an accurately modeled gas turbine (GT) generator. In this paper, a new method was proposed to model, a GT generator system. Firstly, MATLAB/Simulink was used to rebuild GT-based model which was validated using a model in PSS/E. Secondly, an artificial intelligence (AI) based approach, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used for problem recognition Cites: Load forecasting using support vector machines: A study on
