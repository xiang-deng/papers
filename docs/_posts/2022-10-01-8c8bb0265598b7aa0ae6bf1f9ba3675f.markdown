Existing techniques for unionable table search define unionability using metadata (tables must have the same or similar schemas) or column-based metrics (for example, the values in a table should be drawn from the same domain). In this work, we introduce the use of semantic relationships between pairs of columns in a table to improve the accuracy of union search. Consequently, we introduce a new notion of unionability that considers relationships between columns, together with the Cites: TURL: Table Understanding through Representation Learning
