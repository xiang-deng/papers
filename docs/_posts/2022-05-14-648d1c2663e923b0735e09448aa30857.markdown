Deep learning methods can struggle to handle domain shifts not seen in training data, which can cause them to not generalize well to unseen domains. This has led to research attention on domain generalization (DG), which aims to the model s generalization ability to out-of-distribution. Adversarial domain generalization is a popular approach to DG, but conventional approaches (1) struggle to sufficiently align features so that local neighborhoods are mixed across domains; and (2) can Cites: Wilds: A benchmark of in-the-wild distribution shifts
