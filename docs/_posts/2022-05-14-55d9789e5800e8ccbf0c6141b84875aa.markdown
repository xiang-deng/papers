The remarkable success of deep learning has prompted interest in its application to medical diagnosis. Even tough state-of-the-art deep learning models have achieved human-level accuracy on the classification of different types of medical data, these models are hardly adopted in clinical workflows, mainly due to their lack of interpretability. The black-box-ness of deep learning models has raised the need for devising strategies to explain the decision process of these models, leading to the Cites: Concept bottleneck models
