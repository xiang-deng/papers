Toxic comment classification is a core natural language processing task for combating online toxic comments. It follows the supervised learning paradigm which requires labelled data for the training. A large amount of high-quality training data is empirically beneficial to the model performance. Transferring a pre-trained language model (PLM) to a downstream model allows the downstream model to access more data without creating new labelled data. Despite the increasing research on PLMs in …
