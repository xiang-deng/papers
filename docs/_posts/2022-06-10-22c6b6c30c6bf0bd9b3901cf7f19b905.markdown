This tutorial demonstrates workflows to incorporate text data into actuarial classification and regression tasks. The main focus is on methods employing transformer-based models. A dataset of car accident descriptions with an average length of 400 words, available in English and German, and a dataset with short property insurance claims descriptions are used to demonstrate these techniques. The case studies tackle challenges related to a multi-lingual setting and long input …
