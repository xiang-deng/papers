Soils are inhabited by communities of tiny invertebrates that participate in the essential functions of soils. Characterizing those communities in terms of species diversity and species abundance is part of investigating soil functions and response to perturbation. Dozens to hundreds of specimens can be extracted from a sample that need to be sorted, counted and identified. It involves an enormous amount of time, straining the workflow of soil zoologists.
