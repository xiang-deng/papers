Advances in natural language processing have resulted in large language models (LLMs) that are capable of generating understandable and sensible written text. Recent versions of these models, such as OpenAI Codex and GPT-3, can generate code and code explanations. However, it is unclear whether and how students might engage with such explanations. In this paper, we report on our experiences generating multiple code explanation types using LLMs and integrating them into an Cites: Pre-train, prompt, and predict: A systematic survey of prompting
