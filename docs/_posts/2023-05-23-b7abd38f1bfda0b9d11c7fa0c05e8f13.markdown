Word sense disambiguation is a basic task in Natural Language Processing which aims to identify the most appropriate sense of ambiguous words in different contexts by applying algorithm models. In this work, we propose a model that uses a stacked bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory neural network and attention mechanism to determine the sense of ambiguous words. First, the stacked bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory is employed for deep embedding-based representation of sentences …
