Context: Users and developers use bug tracking systems to report errors that occur during the development and testing of software. The manual identification of duplicates is a tedious task especially with software that have large bug repositories. In this context, their automatic detection becomes a necessary task that can help prevent frequently fixing the same bug. Objective: In this article, we propose BERT-MLP, a novel pretrained language model using bidirectional encoder Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
