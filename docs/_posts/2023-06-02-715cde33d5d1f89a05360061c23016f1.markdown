We study the problem of discovering joinable datasets at scale. We approach the problem from a learning perspective relying on profiles. These are succinct representations that capture the underlying characteristics of the schemata and data values of datasets, which can be efficiently extracted in a distributed and parallel fashion. Profiles are then compared, to predict the quality of a join operation among a pair of attributes from different datasets. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, we define a  Cites: The seattle report on database research
