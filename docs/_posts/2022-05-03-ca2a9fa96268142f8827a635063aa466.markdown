To train image-caption retrieval (ICR) methods, contrastive loss functions are a common choice for optimization functions. Unfortunately, contrastive ICR methods are vulnerable to learning shortcuts: decision rules that perform well on the training data but fail to transfer to other testing conditions. We introduce an approach to reduce shortcut feature representations for the ICR task: latent target decoding (LTD). We add an additional decoder to the learning framework to reconstruct the input Cites: Oscar: Object-semantics aligned pre-training for vision-language
