TypeScript and Python are two programming languages that support optional type annotations, which are useful but tedious to introduce and maintain. This has motivated automated type prediction: given an untyped program, produce a well-typed output program. Large language models (LLMs) are promising for type prediction, but there are challenges: fill-in-the-middle performs poorly, programs may not fit into the context window, generated types may not type check, and it is difficult …
