Music information retrieval (MIR) has witnessed rapid advances in various tasks like musical similarity, music genre classification (MGC), etc. MGC and audio tagging are approached using various features through traditional machine learning and deep learning (DL) based techniques by many researchers. DL-based models require a large amount of data to generalize well on new data samples. Unfortunately, the lack of sizeable open music datasets makes the analyses of the robustness of musical Cites: Effective approaches to attention-based neural machine translation
