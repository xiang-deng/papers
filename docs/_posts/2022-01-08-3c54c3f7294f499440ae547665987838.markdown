Supervised deep learning approaches for automated diagnosis support require datasets annotated by experts. Intra-annotator variability of a single annotator and inter-annotator variability between annotators can affect the quality of the diagnosis support. As medical experts will always differ in annotation details, quantitative studies concerning the annotation quality are of particular interest. A consistent and noise-free annotation of large-scale datasets by, for example, dermatologists or Cites: Deep neural networks improve radiologists performance in breast
