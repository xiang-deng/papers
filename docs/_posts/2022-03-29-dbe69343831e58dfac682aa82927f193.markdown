Every year physicians face an increasing demand of image-based diagnosis from patients, a problem that can be addressed with recent artificial intelligence methods. In this context, we survey works in the area of automatic report generation from medical images, with emphasis on methods using deep neural networks, with respect to:(1) Datasets,(2) Architecture Design,(3) Explainability and (4) Evaluation Metrics. Our survey identifies interesting developments, but also remaining Cites:   Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
