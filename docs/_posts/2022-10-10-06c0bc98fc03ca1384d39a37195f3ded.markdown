Data denoising is an essential issue in machine learning and computer vision. However, most existing denoising methods can handle only low-noise data, because it is difficult for these methods to obtain the true structures of high-noise data. An existing partial solution is to consolidate the structures of data by moving each sample to its near high density region. It actually regards all non-noisy samples as noisy ones, but non-noisy samples are important for constructing the structures of Cites: Maximum Margin Coresets for Active and Noise Tolerant Learning.
