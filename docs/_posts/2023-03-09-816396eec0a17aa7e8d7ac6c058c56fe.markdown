Building high-performing end-to-end machine learning systems primarily consists of developing the machine learning model and gathering high-quality training data for the application of interest, assuming one has access to the right hardware. Although machine learning models are getting increasingly commoditized in the last few years with the rise of open-sourced platforms, curating high-quality labeled training datasets is still either costly or not feasible for many real-world applications. Hence …
