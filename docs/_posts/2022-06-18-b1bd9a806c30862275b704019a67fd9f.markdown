Background Lumbar spine MRI studies are widely used for back pain assessment. Interpretation involves grading lumbar spinal stenosis, which is repetitive and time consuming. Deep learning (DL) could provide faster and more consistent interpretation. Purpose To assess the speed and interobserver agreement of radiologists for reporting lumbar spinal stenosis with and without DL assistance. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a DL model designed to assist  Cites: Evaluation of combined artificial intelligence and radiologist
