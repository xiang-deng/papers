Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN) has been receiving a lot of attention recently due to its capability in modeling time-evolving graph-related tasks. Similar to Graph Neural Networks, it is also non-trivial to interpret predictions made by a TGNN due to its black-box nature. A major approach tackling this problems in GNNs is by analyzing the model responses on some perturbations of the model s inputs, called perturbation-based explanation methods. While these methods are convenient and  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
