To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent agent needs to incrementally acquire, update, accumulate, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. In a general sense, continual learning is explicitly limited by catastrophic forgetting, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop of the old tasks. Beyond this, increasingly numerous advances  Cites: ELLE: Efficient Lifelong Pre-training for Emerging Data
