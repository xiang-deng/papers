Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. It is a fast evolving field in the recent years because of the development of large-scale datasets and the deep learning technology. Even though, numerous MRC models have been developed for Question Answer (QA) system, the existing MRC models are not on par with reading comprehension. In order to assess and improve the performance of the projected datasets, an advanced Cites: Interpretation of natural language rules in conversational machine
