Code completion tools are frequently used by software developers to accelerate software development by suggesting the following code elements. Completing a sequence of code tokens (eg, a full line of code) has been proved more efficient than predicting a single token at a time. To complete the code sequence, researchers are employing AutoRegressive (AR) decoders to generate tokens in a left-to-right, token- by-token fashion. Consequently, the prediction of the next token depends on all Cites: FlowSeq: Non-Autoregressive Conditional Sequence Generation
