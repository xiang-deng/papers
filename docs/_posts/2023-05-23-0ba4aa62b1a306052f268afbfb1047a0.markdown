Software is constantly changing, requiring developers to perform several derived tasks in a timely manner, such as writing a description for the intention of the code change, or identifying the defect-prone code changes. Considering that the cost of dealing with these tasks can account for a large proportion (typically around 70 percent) of the total development expenditure, automating such processes will significantly lighten the burdens of developers. To achieve such a target, existing Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
