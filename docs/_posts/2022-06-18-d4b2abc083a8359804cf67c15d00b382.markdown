Effective decision making involves flexibly relating past experiences and relevant contextual information to a novel situation. In deep reinforcement learning, the dominant paradigm is for an agent to amortise information that helps decision-making into its network weights via gradient descent on training losses. Here, we pursue an alternative approach in which agents can utilise large-scale context-sensitive database lookups to support their parametric computations. This allows …
