Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is an active area of research in machine learning with many important practical applications. The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC), a set of fully-cooperative partially observable MARL test environments using StarCraft II, is an important standardized benchmark in this field. Despite its value, SMAC remains inaccessible to many researchers in this field as it requires expensive computer hardware to use in practice. This project introduces …
