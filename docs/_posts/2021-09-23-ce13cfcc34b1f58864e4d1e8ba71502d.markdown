Causal event extraction (CEE) aims to identify and extract causeeffect event pairs from texts, which is a fundamental task in natural language processing. Recent research treat CEE as a sequence labeling problem. However, the linguistic complexity and ambiguity of textual description results in the low accuracy of extractors. To address the above issues, considering the prior knowledge like the causal network constructed based on the causal indicators, which can represent Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
