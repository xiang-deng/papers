We propose Text2Motion, a language-based planning framework enabling robots to solve sequential manipulation tasks that require long-horizon reasoning. Given a natural language instruction, our framework constructs both a task-and policy-level plan that is verified to reach inferred symbolic goals. Text2Motion uses skill feasibility heuristics encoded in learned Q-functions to guide task planning with Large Language Models. Whereas previous language-based planners only consider the  Cites: Chain of thought prompting elicits reasoning in large language
