Deep learning based models are used regularly in every applications nowadays. Generally we train a single model on a single task. However, we can train multiple tasks on a single model under multi-task learning (MTL) settings. This provides us many benefits like lesser training time, training a single model for multiple tasks, reducing overfitting, and improving performances. To train a model in multi-task learning settings we need to sum the loss values from different tasks. In vanilla multi Cites: Squad: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text
