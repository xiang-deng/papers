Data scientists frequently examine the raw content of large tables when exploring an unknown dataset. In such cases, small subsets of the full tables (sub-tables) that accurately capture table contents are useful. We present a framework which, given a large data table T, creates a sub-table of small, fixed dimensions by selecting a subset of T s rows and projecting them over a subset of T s columns. The question is: Which rows and columns should be selected to yield an informative sub-table? Our  Cites: Visualization-aware sampling for very large databases
