Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become important auxiliary information for helping recommender systems obtain a good understanding of user preferences. Despite recent advances in KG-based recommender systems, existing methods are prone to suboptimal performance due to the following two drawbacks: 1) current KG-based methods over-emphasize the heterogeneous structural information within a KG and overlook the underlying semantics of its connections, hindering the recommender Cites: K-adapter: Infusing knowledge into pre-trained models with adapters
