Error detection is a critical step in data cleaning. Most traditional error detection methods are based on rules and external information with high cost, especially when dealing with large-scaled data. Recently, with the advances of deep learning, some researchers focus their attention on learning the semantic distribution of data for error detection; however, the low error rate in real datasets makes it hard to collect negative samples for training supervised deep learning models.
