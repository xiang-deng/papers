In response to the exponential growth of the volume of scientific publications, researchers have proposed a multitude of information extraction methods for extracting entities and relations, such as task, dataset, metric, and method entities. However, the existing methods cannot directly provide readers with procedural scientific information that demonstrates the path to the problem s solution. From the perspective of applied science, we propose a novel schema for the applied AI  Cites: Semeval 2017 task 10: Scienceie-extracting keyphrases and
