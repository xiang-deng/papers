Domain adaptation indeed promotes the progress of intelligent fault diagnosis in industrial scenarios. The abundant labeled samples are not necessary. The identical distribution between the training and testing datasets is not any more the prerequisite for intelligent fault diagnosis working. However, two issues arise subsequently: Feature learning in domain adaptation framework tends to be biased to the source domain, and unreliable pseudolabeling seriously impacts on the conditional domain Cites: Understanding self-training for gradual domain adaptation
