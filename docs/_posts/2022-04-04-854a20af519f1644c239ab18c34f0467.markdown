Simple Summary The health of dairy cows is important for milk quality and the health of the mammary gland. Traditionally, teat-end health has been assessed manually through visual inspection of teat-end callosity thickness and roughness (ie, hyperkeratosis), which is a risk-factor for mastitis. Here, we describe a computer- vision approach to replace the time-consuming and expensive manual assessment of teat-end hyperkeratosis. Using separable confident transductive learning, a Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
