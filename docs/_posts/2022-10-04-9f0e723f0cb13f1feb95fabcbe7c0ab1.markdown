We introduce YATO, an open-source toolkit for text analysis with deep learning. It focuses on fundamental sequence labeling and sequence classification tasks on text. Designed in a hierarchical structure, YATO supports free combinations of three types of features including 1) traditional neural networks (CNN, RNN, etc.); 2) pre-trained language models (BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, etc.); and 3) user-customed neural features via a simple configurable file. Benefiting from the advantages of …
