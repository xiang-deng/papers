As social networks take an ever-prominent role in information access, combating disinformation becomes increasingly important. Given current volumes of data, automated approaches for the detection of disinformation are the only ones able to offer an online solution. We formalize disinformation as an anomaly in the organic evolution of the network, in terms of users, content or coordination. To identify it, we propose a solution based on Temporal Graph Networks (TGN) adapted to the Cites: Compare to the knowledge: Graph neural fake news detection with
