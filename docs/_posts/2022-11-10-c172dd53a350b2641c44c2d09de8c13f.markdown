Humans can classify an unseen category by reasoning on its language explanations. This ability is owing to the compositional nature of language: we can combine previously seen concepts to describe the new category. For example, we might describe mavens as a kind of large birds with black feathers , so that others can use their knowledge of concepts large birds and black feathers to recognize a maven. Inspired by this observation, in this work we tackle zero-shot classification task by Cites: Improving and Simplifying Pattern Exploiting Training
