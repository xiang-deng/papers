Dense retrieval methods have surpassed traditional sparse retrieval methods for open-domain retrieval. While these methods, such as the Dense Passage Retriever (DPR), work well on datasets or domains they have been trained on, there is a noticeable loss in accuracy when tested on out-of-distribution and out-of-domain datasets. We hypothesize that this may be, in large part, due to the mismatch in the information available to the context encoder and the query encoder during training  Cites: Fact or fiction: Verifying scientific claims
