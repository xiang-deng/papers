Entity and relation extraction is an essential task in knowledge acquisition and representation. Since novel relations continue to emerge in practice, the extraction for novel relational triplets is urgently needed but understudied. Existing works heavily rely on large-scale artificial external knowledge instead of just the corpus itself to predict novel relations, which require costly human work. In this paper, we propose a semantic-consistent learning method (SCL) for one-shot joint entity and …
