Benefiting from the development of hyperspectral imaging technology, hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has become a significant research direction in remote sensing image analysis. However, labeling HSI requires sufficient domain knowledge and consumes a lot of human and material resources. In addition, HSI contains rich spectral and spatial features, and how to fully extract these two joint features remains a problem worth exploring.
