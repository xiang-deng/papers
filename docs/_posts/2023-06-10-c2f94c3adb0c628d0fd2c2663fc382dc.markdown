A key component of modern conversational systems is the Dialogue State Tracker (or DST), which models a user s goals and needs. Toward building more robust and reliable DSTs, we introduce a prompt-based learning approach to automatically generate effective adversarial examples to probe DST models. Two key characteristics of this approach are:(i) it only needs the output of the DST with no need for model parameters, and (ii) it can learn to generate natural language …
