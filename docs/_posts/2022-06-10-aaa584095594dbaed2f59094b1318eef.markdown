Few-shot learning with large-scale, pre-trained language models is a powerful way to answer questions about code, eg, how to complete a given code example, or even generate code snippets from scratch. The success of these models raises the question whether they could serve as a basis for building a wide range code generation tools. Traditionally, such tools are built manually and separately for each task. Instead, few-shot learning may allow to obtain different tools from a single preÂ â€¦
