Deep learning has been widely applied in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and data mining. Although deep learning has achieved significant success in solving complex problems, it has been shown that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, resulting in models that fail to perform their tasks properly, which limits the application of deep learning in security-critical areas. In this paper, we first review some of the classical and latest representative  Cites: Meta pseudo labels
