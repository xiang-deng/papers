Knowledge-enhanced neural machine reasoning has garnered significant attention as a cutting-edge yet challenging research area with numerous practical applications. Over the past few years, plenty of studies have leveraged various forms of external knowledge to augment the reasoning capabilities of deep models, tackling challenges such as effective knowledge integration, implicit knowledge mining, and problems of tractability and optimization. However, there is a dearth of a  Cites: Unsupervised commonsense question answering with self-talk
