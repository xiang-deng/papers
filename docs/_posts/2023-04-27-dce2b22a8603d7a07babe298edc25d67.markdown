In the last few years, the availability of temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), which associate time information for each event, increased the need for completing in these TKGs. In order to solve the completion problem, the existing efforts extend static knowledge graph completion models to handle time-dependent representations, or encode the structural information of events for passing temporal message. However, the above efforts mostly construct TKGs in the form of multi-edges mesh and focus on …
