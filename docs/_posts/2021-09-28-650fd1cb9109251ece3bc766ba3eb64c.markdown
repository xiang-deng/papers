Aspect-based sentiment classification is the task of predicting the sentiment tendency of a text toward a given aspect. Existing works on this task mainly focus on aspect- relevant information. In contrast, we design a model (BAT) which could extract overall Background information as well as Aspect-relevant informaTion. To make the BAT model learn better semantic representation of the given text, we introduce two auxiliary tasks (dependency neighborhood prediction and part-of-speech tagging) Cites: Learning latent opinions for aspect-level sentiment classification
