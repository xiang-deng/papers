Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown satisfying performance in various graph analytical problems. Hence, they have become the\emph {de facto} solution in a variety of decision-making scenarios. However, GNNs could yield biased results against certain demographic subgroups. Some recent works have empirically shown that the biased structure of the input network is a significant source of bias for GNNs. Nevertheless, no studies have systematically scrutinized which part of the input  Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
