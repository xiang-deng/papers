Code review is a crucial ingredient to quality software development, but requires a large amount of time and effort for developers. To optimise this manual process, recent research on automated code review seeks to leverage Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models to perform tasks such as automated code improvement. A recent work had pretrained the NMT model for automated code review in order to equip the model with general coding knowledge. However, their pretraining Cites: Codebleu: a method for automatic evaluation of code synthesis
