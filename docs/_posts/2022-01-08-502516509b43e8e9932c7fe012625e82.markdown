Speech-based inputs have been gaining significant momentum with the popularity of smartphones and tablets in our daily lives, since voice is the most easiest and efficient way for human-computer interaction. This paper works towards designing more effective speech-based interfaces to query the structured data in relational databases. We first identify a new task named Speech-to-SQL, which aims to understand the information conveyed by human speech and directly translate it into Cites: Rat-sql: Relation-aware schema encoding and linking for text-to
