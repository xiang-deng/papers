The field of neuroimaging has embraced methods from machine learning in a variety of ways. Although an increasing number of initiatives have published open-access neuroimaging datasets, specifically designed benchmarks are rare in the field. In this article, we first describe how benchmarks in computer science and biomedical imaging have fostered methodological progress in machine learning. Second, we identify the special characteristics of neuroimaging data and outline what Cites: Dynabench: Rethinking benchmarking in NLP
