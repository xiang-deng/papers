Large-scale text retrieval technology has been widely used in various practical business scenarios. This paper presents our systems for the TREC 2022 Deep Learning Track. We explain the hybrid text retrieval and multi-stage text ranking method adopted in our solution. The retrieval stage combined the two structures of traditional sparse retrieval and neural dense retrieval. In the ranking stage, in addition to the full interactionbased ranking model built on large pre-trained Cites: Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering
