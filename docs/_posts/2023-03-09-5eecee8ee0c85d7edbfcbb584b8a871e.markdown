Named entity recognition (NER) is a sequential labelling task in categorizing textual nuggets into specific types. Named entity boundary detection can be recognized as a prominent research area under the NER domain which has been heavily adapted for information extraction, event extraction, information retrieval, sentiment analysis etc. Named entities (NE) can be identified as per flat NEs and nested NEs in nature and limited research attempts have been made for nested NE boundary detection. NER …
