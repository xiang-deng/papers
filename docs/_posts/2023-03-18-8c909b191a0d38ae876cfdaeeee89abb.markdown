We report the ionization reduction of atoms in two-color femtosecond laser fields in this joint theoretical-experimental study. For the multiphoton ionization of atoms using a 400 nm laser pulse, the ionization probability is reduced if another relatively weak 800 nm laser pulse is overlapped. Such ionization reduction consistently occurs regardless of the relative phase between the two pulses. The time-dependent Schrödinger equation simulation results indicate that with the assisted 800 nm …
