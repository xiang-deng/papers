Background Postoperative discharge to facilities account for over 33% of the $2.7 billion revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA)-associated annual expenditures and are associated with increased complications when compared to home discharges. Prior studies predicting discharge disposition using advanced machine learning (ML) have been limited due to a lack of generalizability and validation. This study aimed to establish ML model generalizability by externally validating its prediction for non …
