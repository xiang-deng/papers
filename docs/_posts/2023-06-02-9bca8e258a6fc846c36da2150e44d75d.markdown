Neural sentence simplification method based on sequence-to-sequence framework has become the mainstream method for sentence simplification (SS) task. Unfortunately, these methods are currently limited by the scarcity of parallel SS corpus. In this paper, we focus on how to reduce the dependence on parallel corpus by leveraging a careful initialization for neural SS methods from paraphrase corpus. Our work is motivated by the following two findings:(1) Paraphrase corpus includes a  Cites: Paraphrasing revisited with neural machine translation
