The traditional optimization of airfoils relies on, and is limited by, the knowledge and experience of the designer. As a method of intelligent decision-making, reinforcement learning can be used for such optimization through self-directed learning. In this paper, we use the liftdrag ratio as the objective of optimization to propose a method for the aerodynamic optimization of airfoils based on a combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning.
