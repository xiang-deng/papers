Named entity recognition (NER) is a prominent task in identifying text spans to specific types. Named entity boundary detection can be mentioned as a rising research area under NER. Although a limited work has been conducted for nested NE boundary detection, flat NE boundary detection can be considered as at a pinnacle stage. Nested NE boundary detection is an important aspect in information extraction, information retrieval, event extraction, sentiment analysis etc. On the other Cites: Neural segmental hypergraphs for overlapping mention recognition
