Shear failure of reinforced concrete (RC) beams is a form of brittle failure and has always been a concern. This study adopted the interpretable machine-learning technique to predict failure modes and identify the boundary value between different failure modes to avoid diagonal splitting failure. An experimental database consisting of 295 RC beams with or without transverse reinforcements was established. Two features were constructed to reflect the design characteristics of RC beams, namely …
