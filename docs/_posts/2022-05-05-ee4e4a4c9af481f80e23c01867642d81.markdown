We review the field of machinelearning (ML) and dataintensive methods for rechargeable battery materials development. We highlight advancements in high throughput density functional theory calculation of materials properties, and discuss how these advancements have enabled the application of ML or datadriven methods to accelerate property prediction. We provide an overview of the fundamentals of machine learning, including a discussion of underfitting vs Cites: Glove: Global vectors for word representation
