Planning is a data efficient decision-making strategy where an agent selects candidate actions by exploring possible future states. To simulate future states when there is a high-dimensional action space, the knowledge of one s decision making strategy must be used to limit the number of actions to be explored. We refer to the model used to simulate one s decisions as the agent s self-model. While self-models are implicitly used widely in conjunction with world models to plan actions, it remains  Cites: Separating the world and ego models for self-driving
