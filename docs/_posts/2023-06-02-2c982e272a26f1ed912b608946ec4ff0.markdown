Task-oriented semantic parsing has drawn a lot of interest from the NLP community, and especially the voice assistant use-cases as it enables representing the meaning of user requests with arbitrarily nested semantics, including multiple intents and compound entities. SOTA models are large seq2seq transformers and require hundreds of thousands of annotated examples to be trained. However annotating such data to bootstrap new domains or languages is expensive and error-prone  Cites: Meta-learning for domain generalization in semantic parsing
