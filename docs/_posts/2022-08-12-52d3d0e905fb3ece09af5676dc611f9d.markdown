We detail a deep learning approach based on the transformer architecture for performing fake news detection. The proposed approach is composed of a deep learning network which receives as input the claim to be verified, a series of predictions made by other models, and supporting evidence in the form of ranked passages. We validate our approach participating as the BrisbaneUdineMelbourne (BUM) Team in the CLEF2022-CheckThat! Lab (Task 3: Fake News Cites: HoVer: A Dataset for Many-Hop Fact Extraction And Claim
