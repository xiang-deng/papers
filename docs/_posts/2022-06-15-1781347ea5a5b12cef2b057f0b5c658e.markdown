Traditional dialogue summarization models rely on a large-scale manually-labeled corpus, lacking generalization ability to new domains, and domain adaptation from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain is important in practical summarization scenarios. However, existing domain adaptation works in dialogue summarization generally require large-scale pre-training using extensive external data. To explore the lightweight fine-tuning methods, in this paper, we propose an …
