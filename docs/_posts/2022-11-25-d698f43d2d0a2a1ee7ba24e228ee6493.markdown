Practical deployment of deep neural networks has become widespread in the last decade due to their ability to provide simple, intelligent, and automated processing of the tasks that up to now were hard for other machine learning models. There is an enormous financial and societal interest in deep neural networks as a viable solution for many practical problems such as computer vision, language processing, financial fraud detection, and many more. At the same time, some concerns regarding the …
