Recently, pre-training based approaches are proposed to leverage self-supervised signals for improving the performance of sequential recommendation. However, most of existing pre-training recommender systems simply model the historical behavior of a user as a sequence, while lack of sufficient consideration on temporal interaction patterns that are useful for modeling user behavior. In order to better model temporal characteristics of user behavior sequences, we propose a T emporal C ontrastive P Cites: UPRec: User-Aware Pre-training for Recommender Systems
