The energy consumption for training deep learning models is increasing at an alarming rate due to the growth of training data and model scale, resulting in a negative impact on carbon neutrality. Energy consumption is an especially pressing issue for AutoML algorithms because it usually requires repeatedly training large numbers of computationally intensive deep models to search for optimal configurations. This paper takes one of the most essential steps in developing  Cites: Can weight sharing outperform random architecture search? an
