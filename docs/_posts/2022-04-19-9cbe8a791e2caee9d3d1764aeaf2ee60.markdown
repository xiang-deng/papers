Recently, OT (operational technology) networks of industrial control systems have been combined with IT networks. Therefore, OT networks have inherited the vulnerabilities and attack paths existing in IT networks. Consequently, attacks on industrial control systems are increasing, and research on technologies combined with artificial intelligence for detecting attacks is active. Current research focuses on detecting attacks and improving the detection accuracy. Few studies exist on metrics Cites: Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for
