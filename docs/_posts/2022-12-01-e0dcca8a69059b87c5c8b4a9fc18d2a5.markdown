Machine Learning algorithms have had a profound impact on the field of computer science over the past few decades. These algorithms performance is greatly influenced by the representations that are derived from the data in the learning process. The representations learned in a successful learning process should be concise, discrete, meaningful, and able to be applied across a variety of tasks. A recent effort has been directed toward developing Deep Learning models, which …
