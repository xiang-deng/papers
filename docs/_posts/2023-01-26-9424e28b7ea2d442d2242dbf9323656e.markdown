Statistical divergences have been widely used in statistics and artificial intelligence to measure the dissimilarity between probability distributions. The applications range from generative modeling to statistical inference. Early works in statistics have focused on discrete and low-dimensional probability distributions. We choose to tackle problems emerging in modern applications of statistics and artificial intelligence in which the sample space is either discrete with a large alphabet (eg …
