Exact inference for large, directed graphical models, also known as Bayesian networks (BNs), can be intractable as the space complexity grows exponentially in the tree-width of the model. Approximate inference, such as generalized belief propagation (GBP), is used instead. GBP treats inference as the Bethe/Kikuchi energy function optimization problem. The solution is found using iterative message passing, which is inefficient and convergent problematic. Recent progress on Cites: On amortizing inference cost for structured prediction
