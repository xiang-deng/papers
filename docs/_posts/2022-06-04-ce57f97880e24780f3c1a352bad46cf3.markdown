The fast advancement in machine translation models necessitates the development of accurate evaluation metrics that would allow researchers to track the progress in text languages. The evaluation of machine translation models is crucial since its results are exploited for improvements of translation models. However fully automatically evaluating the machine translation models in itself is a huge challenge for the researchers as human evaluation is very expensive, time-consuming Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
