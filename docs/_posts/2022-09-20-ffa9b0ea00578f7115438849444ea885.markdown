Recommendation System (RS) is a subclass of information filtering system which tracks rating given by users to in-use items. Movie RS act as a tool to provide services to users. With the massive increase of data on internet, users face challenge in searching information and sometimes it is time-consuming process. Hence there is a need to enhance RS in a way to resolve basic problems faced by the users during the search. In this research a hybrid technique is proposed to build a movie  Cites: Deep learning for sentiment analysis: successful approaches and
