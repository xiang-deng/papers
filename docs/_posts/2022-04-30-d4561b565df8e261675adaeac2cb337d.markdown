Recent research has supported that system explainability improves user trust and willingness to use medical AI for diagnostic support. In this paper, we use chest disease diagnosis based on X-Ray images as a case study to investigate user trust and reliance. Building off explainability, we propose a support system where users (radiologists) can view causal explanations for final decisions. After observing these causal explanations, users provided their opinions of the model predictions and Cites: Concept bottleneck models
