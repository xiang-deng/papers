To date, most of the existing open-domain question answering (QA) methods focus on explicit questions where the reasoning steps are mentioned explicitly in the question. In this article, we study implicit QA where the reasoning steps are not evident in the question. Implicit QA is challenging in two aspects. First, evidence retrieval is difficult since there is little overlap between a question and its required evidence. Second, answer inference is difficult since the reasoning strategy is latent  Cites: Learning to retrieve reasoning paths over wikipedia graph for
