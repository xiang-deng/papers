Document retrieval has been extensively studied within the index-retrieve framework for decades, which has withstood the test of time. Unfortunately, such a pipelined framework limits the optimization of the final retrieval quality, because indexing and retrieving are separated stages that can not be jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner. In order to unify these two stages, we explore a model-based indexer for document retrieval. Concretely, we propose Ultron, which encodes the knowledge of Cites: Autoregressive search engines: Generating substrings as
