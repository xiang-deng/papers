While language models have impressive performance in prediction tasks, they often fail on examples that seem simple to humans. The failures can often be described as a result of models lacking common sense. There have been a number of efforts to encode commonsense knowledge using knowledge graphs, but the challenge remains of how best to perform commonsense inference in a way that has the intuitiveness of the knowledge graphs and the coverage and predictive power of the Cites: CommonsenseQA: A Question Answering Challenge Targeting
