Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) is an essential but challenging task in natural language processing that aims to answer questions in natural language formats on the basis of large-scale unstructured passages. Recent research has taken the performance of benchmark datasets to new heights, especially when these datasets are combined with techniques for machine reading comprehension based on Transformer models. However, as identified through our ongoing collaboration Cites: QA-GNN: Reasoning with language models and knowledge
