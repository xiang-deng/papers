Advancements in text representation have produced many deep language models (LMs), such as Word2Vec and recurrent-based LMs. However, there are scarce works that focus on detecting implicit sentiments with a small amount of labelled data because there are many different review areas. Deep learning techniques are suitable to automate the representation learning process. Hence, we proposed a semi-supervised aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) model for online review to  Cites: Effective LSTMs for target-dependent sentiment classification
