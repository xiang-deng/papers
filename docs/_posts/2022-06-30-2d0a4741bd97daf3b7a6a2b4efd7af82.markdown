Generative models, such as Auto-Encoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, Generative Flows, and Diffusion Models, are fascinating for their ability to synthesis versatile visual and audio information from merely noise. This generative process usually requires a model to perceive and compress high-dimensional data into a compact, low-dimensional latent space, where each dimension encodes some valuable semantic variations in the original data space.
