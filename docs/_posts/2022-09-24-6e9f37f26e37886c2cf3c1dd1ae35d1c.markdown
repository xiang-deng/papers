Deep learning-based graph generation approaches have remarkable capacities for graph data modeling, allowing them to solve a wide range of real-world problems. Making these methods able to consider different conditions during the generation procedure even increases their effectiveness by empowering them to generate new graph samples that meet the desired criteria. This paper presents a conditional deep graph generation method called SCGG that considers a particular type of structural …
