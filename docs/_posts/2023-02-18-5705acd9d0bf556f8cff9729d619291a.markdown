Despite some similarities that have been pointed out in the literature, the parallelism between automated planning and natural language processing has not been fully analysed yet. However, the success of Transformer-based models and, more generally, deep learning techniques for NLP, could open interesting research lines also for automated planning. Therefore, in this work, we investigate whether these impressive results could be transferred to planning. In particular, we study how a Cites: BERT with History Answer Embedding for Conversational Question
