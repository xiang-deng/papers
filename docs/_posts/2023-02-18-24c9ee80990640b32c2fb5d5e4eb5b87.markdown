State-of-the-art language generation models can degenerate when applied to open-ended generation problems such as text completion, story generation, or dialog modeling. This degeneration usually shows up in the form of incoherence, lack of vocabulary diversity, and self-repetition or copying from the context. In this paper, we postulate that``human-like  generations usually lie in a narrow and nearly flat entropy band, and violation of these entropy bounds correlates with degenerate behavior …
