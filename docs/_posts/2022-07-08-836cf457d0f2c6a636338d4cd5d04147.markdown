In this paper we present novel data-driven optimization models for Support Vector Machines (SVM), with the aim of linearly separating two sets of points that have non-disjoint convex closures. Traditional classification algorithms assume that the training data points are always known exactly. However, real-life data are often subject to noise. To handle such uncertainty, we formulate robust models with uncertainty sets in the form of hyperrectangles or hyperellipsoids, and propose a moment-based …
