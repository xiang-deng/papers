Causal relation extraction is essential in the causality discovery of natural language processing. The development of causal relation extraction from the model-driven is staggering, so we resort to the data-driven method. More causal information is necessary because most current datasets only label the locations of causal entities or events, which may restrict the learning capacity of models. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark causal strength classification and corresponding Cites: Joint reasoning for temporal and causal relations
