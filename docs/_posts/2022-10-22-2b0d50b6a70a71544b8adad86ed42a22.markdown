Deep learning (DL) solutions have been facing the long-standing problem of making the Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) an integral part of the machine learning pipeline. In recent times, multiple deep learning approaches have been established for solving the enhanced complications aroused due to high predictive capacity. Though DL models demonstrate exceptionally high accuracy but the same comes with computationally complex and difficult to interpret black-box architectures  Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
