This paper focuses on robotic reinforcement learning with sparse rewards for natural language goal representations. An open problem is the sample-inefficiency that stems from the compositionality of natural language, and from the grounding of language in sensory data and actions. We address these issues with three contributions. We first present a mechanism for hindsight instruction replay utilizing expert feedback. Second, we propose a seq2seq model to generate linguistic Cites: Experience grounds language
