In-context learning is a surprising and important phenomenon that emerged when modern language models were scaled to billions of learned parameters. Without modifying a large language model s weights, it can be tuned to perform various downstream natural language tasks simply by including concatenated training examples of these tasks in its input. Though disruptive for many practical applications of large language models, this emergent learning paradigm is not well understood Cites: What can transformers learn in-context? a case study of simple
