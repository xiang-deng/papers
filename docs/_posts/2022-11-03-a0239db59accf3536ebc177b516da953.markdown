Comparing the functional behavior of neural network models, whether it is a single network over time or two (or more networks) during or post-training, is an essential step in understanding what they are learning (and what they are not), and for identifying strategies for regularization or efficiency improvements. Despite recent progress, eg, comparing vision transformers to CNNs, systematic comparison of function, especially across different networks, remains difficult and is often carried out  Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
