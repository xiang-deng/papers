It is necessary to integrate the data reflecting the spatial organization and residents behavior characteristics in design of urban space renewal. Accordingly, based on the current principles of urban space design, a design platform for urban space renewal under the background of big data is proposed in this paper. Through the analysis of platform requirements and the design of organizational structure, the information integration of urban spatial database is mainly studied, where the database features Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
