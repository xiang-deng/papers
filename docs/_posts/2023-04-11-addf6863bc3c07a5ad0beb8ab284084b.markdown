Entity matching (EM) is crucial step in data integration. Supervised machine learning (SML) approaches have attained the SOTA performance in EM. In real-world scenarios SML suffers from absence or lack of large labeled data for training. Active machine learning (AML) for EM minimize the number of training data required and tries to reduce the amount of Hand labeling by picking just the helpful pairs. ALL AML approaches use just one of the two criteria-informativeness or representativeness-for …
