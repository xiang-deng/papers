Considerable attention to kernel subspace clustering has emerged in recent years due to its excellent performance in grouping data points from multiple manifolds. In particular, multiple kernel learning (MKL) is commonly used in kernel subspace clustering models to alleviate the difficulty of choosing a suitable kernel function, which brings out numerous MKL-based subspace clustering methods. Despite these successes, these MKL methods cannot guarantee that the feature representation  Cites: A regularization framework for learning from graph data
