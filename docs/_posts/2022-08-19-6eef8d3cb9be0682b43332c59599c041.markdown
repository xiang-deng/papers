Many recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial attacks on DNNs for natural language processing tasks are notoriously more challenging than that in computer vision. This paper proposes an attention-based genetic algorithm (dubbed AGA) for generating adversarial examples under a black-box setting. In particular, the attention mechanism helps identify the relatively more important words in a given text. Based Cites: Word-level Textual Adversarial Attacking as Combinatorial
