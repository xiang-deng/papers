The rapidly evolving curation of biomedical publications has resulted in an information crisis, such that researchers and other individuals working in biomedical domain require specialized text mining tools to keep track of the ever-evolving literature landscape. With the advances in natural language processing (NLP) models, especially those that are based on deep representation learning, gaining valuable insights from large-scale biomedical corpora have become extremely Cites: Squad: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text
