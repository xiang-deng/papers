Abstract Machine reading comprehension (MRC), as an important task in natural language processing (NLP), is to automatically answer the question after reading a passage. In this aspect, dominant studies mainly focus on domain-specific models. However, domain-specific models trained only on single domain data often cannot achieve satisfactory performance. Although using data of other domains can bring improvement to some extent, building MRC models specific to each domain also  Cites: Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research
