Mechanistic simulators are an indispensable tool for epidemiology to explore the behavior of complex, dynamic infections under varying conditions and navigate uncertain environments.

Agent-based models (ABMs) are an increasingly popular alternative paradigm that can represent the  Cites: The AI Economist: Taxation policy design via two-level deep
