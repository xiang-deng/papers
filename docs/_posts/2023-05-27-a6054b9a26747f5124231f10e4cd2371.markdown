An independent set (IS) is a set of vertices in a graph such that no edge connects any two vertices. In adiabatic quantum computation [E. Farhi, et al., Science 292, 472475 (2001); A. Das, BK Chakrabarti, Rev. Mod. Phys. 80, 10611081 (2008)], a given graph G (V, E) can be naturally mapped onto a many-body Hamiltonian H IS G (V, E), with edges E being the two-body interactions between adjacent vertices V. Thus, solving the IS problem is equivalent to finding all the computational basis ground  Cites: A graph placement methodology for fast chip design
