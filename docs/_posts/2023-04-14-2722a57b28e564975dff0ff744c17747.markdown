Selective prediction aims to learn a reliable model that abstains from making predictions when the model uncertainty is high. These predictions can then be deferred to a human expert for further evaluation. In many real-world scenarios, however, the distribution of test data is different from the training data. This results in more inaccurate predictions, necessitating increased human labeling, which is difficult and expensive in many scenarios. Active learning circumvents this difficulty …
