Supervised learning algorithms, such as decision trees are increasingly used by information technology (IT) organizations to construct classification and prediction models. As these models are deployed to production, integration of secure software development practices is pivotal for IT organizations so that their software projects that use supervised learning are resilient against security attacks.
