ABSTRACT Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an essential sub-task for many important tasks in software engineering (SE), such as automated requirement analysis, opinion mining, question answering, knowledge base construction, and information retrieval. As existing domain-independent NER approaches perform low when applied in the SE domain, we observe the development of different tools and techniques for NER in this domain recently. Despite those developments, we lack our Cites: Unsupervised named-entity extraction from the web: An
