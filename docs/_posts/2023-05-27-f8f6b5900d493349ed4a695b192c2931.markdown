Natural language understanding (NLU) studies often exaggerate or underestimate the capabilities of systems, thereby limiting the reproducibility of their findings. These erroneous evaluations can be attributed to the difficulty of defining and testing NLU adequately. In this position paper, we reconsider this challenge by identifying two types of researcher degrees of freedom. We revisit Turing s original interpretation of the Turing test and indicate that an NLU test does not provide an operational Cites: Polyjuice: Generating Counterfactuals for Explaining, Evaluating
