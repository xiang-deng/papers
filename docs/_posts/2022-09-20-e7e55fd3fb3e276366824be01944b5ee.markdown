The increasing interest in transparent and fair AI systems has propelled the research in explainable AI (XAI). One of the main research lines in XAI is post-hoc explainability, the task of explaining the logic of an already deployed black-box model. This is usually achieved by learning an interpretable surrogate function that approximates the black box. Among the existing explanation paradigms, local linear explanations are one of the most popular due to their simplicity and fidelity. Despite …
