Aptly aims to use large language models to allow for on-the-fly generation of full apps given only an user description of an app idea. In order to optimize this platform and to provide guidance for other platforms or companies aiming to personalize large language models (LLMs) for their needs, we embark on one of the first systematic studies of prompt engineering for the Codex model, a LLM that produces code from a natural-language input. Specifically, we examine the effect of varying the Cites: Incoder: A generative model for code infilling and synthesis
