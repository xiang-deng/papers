Event temporal relation extraction is an important task for information extraction. The existing methods usually rely on feature engineering and require post-process to achieve optimization, though inconsistent optimization may occur in the post-process module and main neural network due to their independence. Recently, a few works start to incorporate the temporal logic rules into the neural network and achieve joint optimization. However, these methods still suffer from two shortcomings:(1) Although …
