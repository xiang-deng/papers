Abstract Machine reading comprehension (MRC) is a question answering task, in which a system provides appropriate answers to users queries in a given document. With large-scale language models and enough training datasets, recent MRC models have surpassed humans in well-designed intrinsic tests that require short and single span answers. However, they have performed poorly in real world applications that require long and multispan answers.
