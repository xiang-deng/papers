Recently, machine learning (ML) has become a popular approach to support self-adaptation. ML has been used to deal with several problems in self-adaptation, such as maintaining an up-to-date runtime model under uncertainty and scalable decision-making. Yet, exploiting ML comes with inherent challenges. In this paper, we focus on a particularly important challenge for learning-based self-adaptive systems: drift in adaptation spaces. With adaptation space we refer to the set of adaptation options a Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
