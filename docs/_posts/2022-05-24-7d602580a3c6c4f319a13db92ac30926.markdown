Relational representation learning has lately received an increase in interest due to its flexibility in modeling a variety of systems like interacting particles, materials and industrial projects for, eg, the design of spacecraft. A prominent method for dealing with relational data are knowledge graph embedding algorithms, where entities and relations of a knowledge graph are mapped to a low-dimensional vector space while preserving its semantic structure. Recently, a graph embedding method has been  Cites: Observed Versus Latent Features for Knowledge Base and Text
