Since 2009, the deep learning revolution---which was triggered by the introduction of ImageNet---has stimulated the synergy between Software Engineering (SE) and Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL). Meanwhile, critical reviews have emerged that suggest that ML/DL should be used cautiously. To improve the applicability and generalizability of ML/DL-related SE studies, we conducted a 12- year Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on 1,428 ML/DL-related SE papers Cites: A syntactic neural model for general-purpose code generation
