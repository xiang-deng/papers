Neural music instrument cloning is an application of deep neural networks for imitating the timbre of a particular music instrument recording. One can create such clones using an approach such as DDSP [1], which has been shown to achieve good synthesis quality for several instrument types [2]. However, this approach needs about ten minutes of audio data from the instrument of interest (target recording audio). In this work, we modify the DDSP architecture and apply transfer learning Cites: Towards realistic midi instrument synthesizers
