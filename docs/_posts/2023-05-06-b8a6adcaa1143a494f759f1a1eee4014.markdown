Transformer-based language models such as BERT and its variants have found widespread use in natural language processing (NLP). A common way of using these models is to fine-tune them to improve their performance on a specific task. However, it is currently unclear how the fine-tuning process affects the underlying structure of the word embeddings from these models. We present TopoBERT, a visual analytics system for interactively exploring the fine-tuning process of various …
