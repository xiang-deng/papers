Social recommendation, which leverages social connections to construct Recommender Systems (RS), plays an important role in alleviating information overload. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received increasing attention due to their great capacity for graph data. Since data in RS is essentially in the structure of graphs, GNN-based RS is flourishing. However, existing works lack in- depth thinking of social recommendations. These methods contain implicit Cites: Recommender systems with social regularization
