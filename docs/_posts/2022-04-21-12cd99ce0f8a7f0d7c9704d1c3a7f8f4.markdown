The aerosol extinction coefficient (AEC) characterises the attenuation of the light propagating in a turbid medium with suspended particles. Therefore, it is of great significance to carry out AEC prediction research using state-of-art neural network (NN) methods. The attention mechanism (AM) has become an indispensable part of NNs that focuses on input weight assignment. Traditional AM is used in time steps to help generate the outputs.
