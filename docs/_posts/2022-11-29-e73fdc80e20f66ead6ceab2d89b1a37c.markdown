Deep learning techniques and attention schemes are used by many researchers for classifying the sentiments. Retrieval of semantic relationship between the aspects with words of context will improve the classification accuracy. This was done by Aspect-Specific Graph Convolutional Networks (ASGCN) which utilizes aspect-specific relationships and attention scheme by researchers. Long-range dependencies and sensitive-important words are missing in these methods. This Cites: Aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network
