In the past few years, the emergence of vision-language pre-training (VLP) has brought cross-modal retrieval to a new era. However, due to the latency and computation demand, it is commonly challenging to apply VLP in a real-time online retrieval system. To alleviate the defect, this paper proposes a\textbf {Hi} erarchical\textbf {V} ision-\textbf {} Language\textbf {P} re-Training (\textbf {HiVLP}) for fast Image-Text Retrieval (ITR). Specifically, we design a novel hierarchical retrieval … Cites: ‪How Much Can CLIP Benefit Vision-and-Language Tasks?‬
