The deep learning has become an important technique for semantic relation classification in patent texts. Previous studies just borrowed the relevant models from generic texts to patent texts while keeping structure of the models unchanged. Due to significant distinctions between patent texts and generic ones, this enables the performance of these models in the patent texts to be reduced dramatically. To highlight these distinct characteristics in patent texts, seven annotated corpora from …
