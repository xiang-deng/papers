Blending free annotation cost, low memory usage and high query speed into a unity, unsupervised deep hashing has shown extraordinary talents in image retrieval. In order to address the lack of semantic information in unsupervised scenario, related works leverage models pretrained on large-scale datasets (eg, ImageNet) to the estimate semantic similarity for specific datasets (eg, FLICKR-25K). However, most of them discard the original semantic attribute in the pretrained datasets, which results …
