Abstract Beyond 5G (B5G) in mobile network technologies is the latest communication technology currently under development. B5G is expected to achieve superior capabilities in ultra-high network transmission speed, low latency, low energy consumption, and high coverage, comparing to current 5G network performance. Although B5G is still in the development and implementation stage, there are many patents and non-patent literature depicting B5G innovative  Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
