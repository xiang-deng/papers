High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data subject to the nonnegativity constraints are commonly encountered in a big data-related application concerning the interactions among numerous nodes. A nonnegative latent factor analysis (NLFA) model can perform representation learning to HDI data efficiently. However, existing NLFA models suffer from either slow convergence rate or representation accuracy loss. To address this issue, this paper proposes a proximal alternating-direction Cites: Recommender systems with social regularization
