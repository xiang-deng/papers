Legal judgment prediction (LJP) and decision support aim to enable machines to predict the verdict of legal cases after reading the description of facts, which is an application of artificial intelligence in the legal field. This paper proposes a legal judgment prediction model based on process supervision for the sequential dependence of each subtask in the legal judgment prediction task. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the model framework and process monitoring …
