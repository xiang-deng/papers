Dialogue intent classification is a fundamental and essential task in dialogue systems. Although sentence-level and document-level text classification have made dramatic progress in recent years with the help of deep learning technology, dialogue-level classification remains challenging. Dialogue has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other types of text. Dialogue is interactive, with feedback between speakers, and turn-taking. These unique features suggest that Cites: Document modeling with gated recurrent neural network for
