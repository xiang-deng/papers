Evaluation of generative models has been an underrepresented field despite the surge of generative architectures. Most recent models are evaluated upon rather obsolete metrics which suffer from robustness issues, while being unable to assess more aspects of visual quality, such as compositionality and logic of synthesis. At the same time, the explainability of generative models remains a limited, though important, research direction with several current attempts requiring access to the  Cites: Integrating Visuospatial, Linguistic and Commonsense Structure
