In modern machine learning, attention computation is a fundamental task for training large language models such as Transformer, GPT-4 and ChatGPT. In this work, we study exponential regression problem which is inspired by the softmax/exp unit in the attention mechanism in large language models. The standard exponential regression is non-convex. We study the regularization version of exponential regression problem which is a convex problem. We use approximate newton method Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
