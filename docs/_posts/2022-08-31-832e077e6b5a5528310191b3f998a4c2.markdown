Scoring function (SF) measures the plausibility of triplets in knowledge graphs. Different scoring functions can lead to huge differences in link prediction performances on different knowledge graphs. In this report, we describe a weird scoring function found by random search on the open graph benchmark (OGB). This scoring function, called AutoWeird, only uses tail entity and relation in a triplet to compute its plausibility score. Experimental results show that AutoWeird achieves top  Cites: Relation prediction as an auxiliary training objective for improving
