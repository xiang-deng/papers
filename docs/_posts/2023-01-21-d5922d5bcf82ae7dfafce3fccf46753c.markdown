Robust loss minimization is an important strategy for handling robust learning issue on noisy labels. Current robust losses, however, inevitably involve hyperparameters to be tuned for different datasets with noisy labels, manually or heuristically through cross validation, which makes them fairly hard to be generally applied in practice. Existing robust loss methods usually assume that all training samples share common hyperparameters, which are independent of instances. This limits the ability of these …
