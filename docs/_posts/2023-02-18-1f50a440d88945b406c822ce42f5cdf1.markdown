Abstractive summarization is flexible and allows the model to generate new words and phrases. However, the familiar words are more likely to be selected as abstract candidate words in the process of abstractive summarization, causing the generated abstract to diverge from the reference. In our consideration, this is caused by representation degeneration of the pre-trained word embedding. Therefore, this paper proposes a general abstractive summarization framework with dynamic word Cites: Whiteningbert: An easy unsupervised sentence embedding
