Most of the existing knowledge graphs are not usually complete and can be complemented by some reasoning algorithms. The reasoning method based on path features is widely used in the field of knowledge graph reasoning and completion on account of that its have strong interpretability. However, reasoning methods based on path features still have several problems in the following aspects: Path search isinefficient, insufficient paths for sparse tasks and some paths are not helpful for …
