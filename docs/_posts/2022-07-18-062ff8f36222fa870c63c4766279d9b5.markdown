The remarkable success of deep learning is largely attributed to the collection of large datasets with human-annotated labels. However, it is extremely expensive and time-consuming to label extensive data with high-quality annotations. In other words, noisy samples are inevitable in large datasets. In this thesis, we aim to tackle the issues caused by noisy training samples under two noise-sensitive practical settings: instance recognition task and few-shot classification task.
