Chest radiography is the modality of choice for the identification of rib fractures in young children and there is value for the development of computer-aided rib fracture detection in this age group. However, the automated identification of rib fractures on chest radiographs can be challenging due to the need for high spatial resolution in deep learning frameworks. A patch-based deep learning algorithm was developed to automatically detect rib fractures on frontal chest radiographs in children under 2 …
