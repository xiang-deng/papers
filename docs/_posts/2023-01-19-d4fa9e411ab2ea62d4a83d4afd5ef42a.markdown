Deep learning technology has unprecedentedly developed in the last decade and has become the primary choice in many application domains. This progress is mainly attributed to a systematic collaboration that rapidly growing computing resources encourage advanced algorithms to deal with massive data. However, it gradually becomes challenging to cope with the unlimited growth of data with limited computing power. To this end, diverse approaches are proposed to improve data …
