Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated an impressive ability to perform arithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks when provided with a few examples at test time (few-shot prompting). Much of this success can be attributed to prompting methods for reasoning, such as chain-of-thought, that employ LLMs for both understanding the problem description by decomposing it into steps, as well as solving each step of the problem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this sort of step-by …
