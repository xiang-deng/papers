Conversational systems now attract great attention due to their promising potential and commercial values. To build a conversational system with moderate intelligence is challenging and requires big (conversational) data, as well as interdisciplinary techniques. Thanks to the prosperity of the Web, the massive data available greatly facilitate data-driven methods such as deep learning for human-computer conversational systems. In general, retrieval-based conversational systems apply Cites: A knowledge-grounded neural conversation model
