We introduce a new dataset for conversational question answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with verbalized answers. Question answering over KGs is currently focused on answer generation for single-turn questions (KGQA) or multiple-tun conversational question answering (ConvQA). However, in a real-world scenario (eg, voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant), users prefer verbalized answers. This paper contributes to the state-of-the-art by extending an existing Cites: Few-Shot Generative Conversational Query Rewriting
