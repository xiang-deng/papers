We present a novel iterative extraction (IterX) model for extracting complex relations, or templates, ie, N-tuples representing a mapping from named slots to spans of text contained within a document. Documents may support zero or more instances of a template of any particular type, leading to the tasks of identifying the templates in a document, and extracting each template s slot values. Our imitation learning approach relieves the need to use predefined template orders to train an extractor  Cites: Scirex: A challenge dataset for document-level information extraction
