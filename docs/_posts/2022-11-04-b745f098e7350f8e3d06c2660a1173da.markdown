The fast growth of communication technology has brought nations and their cultures closer together, and the demand for cross-language communication has risen tremendously. There is a different learning method to connect the source language to the target language in which unsupervised learning is a blessing for low-resource languages. The unsupervised machine translation is always problematic to those languages which are morphologically rich and low resources languages …
