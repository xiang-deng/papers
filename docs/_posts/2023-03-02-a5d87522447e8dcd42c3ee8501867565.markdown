We propose a novel non-parametric/un-trainable language model, named Non-Parametric Pairwise Attention Random Walk Model (NoPPA), to generate sentence embedding only with pre-trained word embedding and pre-counted word frequency. To the best we know, this study is the first successful attempt to break the constraint on bag-of-words assumption with a non-parametric attention mechanism. We evaluate our method on eight different downstream classification tasks. The …
