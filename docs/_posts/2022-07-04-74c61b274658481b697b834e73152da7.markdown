Deep neural networks have completely revolutionized the field of machine learning by achieving state-of-the-art results on various tasks ranging from computer vision to protein folding. However, their application is hindered by their large computational and memory requirements. In this thesis, we propose methods for improving the efficiency of deep neural networks. Firstly, we tackle the sample inefficiency of neural network training with an importance sampling algorithm suitable for deep neural …
