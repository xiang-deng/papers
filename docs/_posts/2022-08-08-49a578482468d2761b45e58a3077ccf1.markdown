Few-shot learning (FSL), purposing to resolve the problem of data-scarce, has attracted considerable attention in recent years. A popular FSL framework contains two phases:(i) the pre-train phase employs the base data to train a CNN-based feature extractor.(ii) the meta-test phase applies the frozen feature extractor to novel data (novel data has different categories from base data) and designs a classifier for recognition. To correct few-shot data distribution, researchers propose Semi Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
