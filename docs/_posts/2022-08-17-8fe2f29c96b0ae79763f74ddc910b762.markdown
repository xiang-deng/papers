Open-set domain adaptation aims to improve the generalization performance of a learning algorithm on a target task of interest by leveraging the label information from a relevant source task with only a subset of classes. However, most existing works are designed for the static setting, and can be hardly extended to the dynamic setting commonly seen in many real-world applications. In this paper, we focus on the more realistic open-set domain adaptation setting with a static source task and a time Cites: Understanding self-training for gradual domain adaptation
