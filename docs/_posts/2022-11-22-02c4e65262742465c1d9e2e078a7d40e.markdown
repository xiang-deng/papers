Recommender systems are considered to be capable of predicting what the next product a customer should purchase is. It is crucial to identify which customers are more suitable than others to target a product for cross-selling in the retail industry. Using recurrent neural networks with self-attention mechanisms, this study proposes a hybrid model. Furthermore, the proposed design is capable of handling both sequential and non-sequential features, which correspond to purchase behavior and  Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
