Sentiment analysis has always been an important basic task in the NLP field. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely used in aspect-level sentiment analysis. Because GCNs have good aggregation effects, every node can contain neighboring node information. However, in previous studies, most models used only a single GCN to learn contextual information. The GCN relies on the construction method of the graph, and a single GCN will cause the model to focus …
