Digital ink (online handwriting) generation has a number of potential applications for creating user-visible content, such as handwriting autocompletion, spelling correction, and beautification. Writing is personal and usually the processing is done on-device. Ink generative models thus need to produce high quality content quickly, in a resource constrained environment. In this work, we study ways to maximize the quality of the output of a trained digital ink generative model, while staying within an  Cites: Coder Reviewer Reranking for Code Generation
