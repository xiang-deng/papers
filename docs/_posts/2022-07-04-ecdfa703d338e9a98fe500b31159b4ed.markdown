Current research in yes/no question answering (QA) focuses on transfer learning techniques and transformer-based models. Models trained on large corpora are fine-tuned on tasks similar to yes/no QA, and then the captured knowledge is transferred for solving the yes/no QA task. Most previous studies use existing similar tasks, such as natural language inference or extractive QA, for the fine-tuning step. This paper follows a different perspective, hypothesizing that an artificial yes/no task can transfer  Cites: Muppet: Massive multi-task representations with pre-finetuning
