Academic papers form citation networks wherein each paper is a node and citation relationships between papers are edges. The embeddings of each paper obtained by projecting the citation network into a vector space are called citation network embeddings. Thus far, only a limited number of studies have focused on incorporating information regarding the intent of one paper to cite another paper. We consider citation context, ie, the text to cite a paper, as a source of information for Cites: CitationIE: Leveraging the Citation Graph for Scientific Information
