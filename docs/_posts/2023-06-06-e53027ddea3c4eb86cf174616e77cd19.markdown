Abstract In the Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) Inference problem, for any given probability distribution, the goal is to find the point in the support of that distribution with the highest probability. Potts models and Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are probabilistic models that were introduced in the context of statistical physics several decades ago. They have been extensively used in several computer science applications like computer vision, recommender systems, and document …
