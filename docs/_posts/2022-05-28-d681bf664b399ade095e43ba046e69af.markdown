We demonstrate SubTab, a framework for creating small, informative sub-tables of large data tables to speed up data exploration.

The rows and columns are chosen as representatives of prominent data patterns within and across columns in the input table. SubTab can also be used for … Cites: ‪Visualization-aware sampling for very large databases‬
