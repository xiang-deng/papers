Modern object detection for aerial images requires numerous annotated data. However, the data annotation process inevitably introduces noise due to the bird s eye view perspective of aerial images and the professional requirements of annotations. While recent noise-robust object detection methods achieved great success, the noise side-effect during the early training stage was still a problem. As demonstrated in this letter, noise during the early training stage will cumulatively Cites: Towards noise-resistant object detection with noisy annotations
