We study the problem of self-supervised and interpretable data cleaning, which automatically extracts interpretable data repair rules from dirty data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely Garf, based on sequence generative adversarial networks (SeqGAN). One key information Garf tries to capture is data repair rules (for
