To make robots accessible to a broad audience, it is critical to endow them with the ability to take universal modes of communication, like commands given in natural language, and extract a concrete desired task specification, defined using a formal language like linear temporal logic (LTL). In this paper, we present a learning-based approach for translating from natural language commands to LTL specifications with very limited human-labeled training data. This is in stark contrast to existing natural Cites: Semantic parsing with syntax-and table-aware sql generation
