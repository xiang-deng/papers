In contrast to classic autoregressive generation, insertion-based models can predict in a order-free way multiple tokens at a time, which make their generation uniquely controllable: it can be constrained to strictly include an ordered list of tokens. We propose to exploit this feature in a new diverse paraphrasing framework: first, we extract important tokens or keywords in the source sentence; second, we augment them; third, we generate new samples around them by using insertion models.
