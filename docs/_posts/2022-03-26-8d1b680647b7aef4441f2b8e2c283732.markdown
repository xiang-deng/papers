Despite the recent success of end-to-end deep neural networks, there are growing concerns about their lack of logical reasoning abilities, especially on cognitive tasks with perception and reasoning processes. A solution is the neural symbolic learning (NeSyL) method that can effectively utilize pre-defined logic rules to constrain the neural architecture making it perform better on cognitive tasks. However, it is challenging to apply NeSyL to these cognitive tasks because of the lack of Cites: Neural symbolic reader: Scalable integration of distributed and
