Neural language models have drastically changed the landscape of natural language processing (NLP). Originally used for language generation (eg, in summarization and dialogue systems) and scoring (eg, in automatic speech recognition and statistical machine translation), these models now widely serve as the universal starting point for transfer learning on almost all NLP tasks. This development is largely due to matters of scale—because language models require …
