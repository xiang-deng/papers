Language Models (LMs) have proven to be useful in various downstream applications, such as summarisation, translation, question answering and text classification. LMs are becoming increasingly important tools in Artificial Intelligence, because of the vast quantity of information they can store. In this work, we present ProP (Prompting as Probing), which utilizes GPT-3, a large Language Model originally proposed by OpenAI in 2020, to perform the task of Knowledge Base Cites: Opt: Open pre-trained transformer language models
