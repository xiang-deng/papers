In this paper, we present an English-to-Japanese simultaneous speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system. It has three Transformer-based incremental processing modules for S2ST: automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). We also evaluated its system-level latency in addition to the modulelevel latency and accuracy. Cites: Effective approaches to attention-based neural machine translation
