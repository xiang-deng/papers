At present, most of the methods for knowledge graph completion (KGC) task highly rely on external knowledge base or graph representation learning. However, how to complete this task without using any external prior knowledge is still a huge challenge and difficulty. To this end, we propose a novel framework which converts the plausibility evaluation of knowledge triple task to the question and answer (QA) task with the thought of KG-BERT and prompt learning. We also test the effect of Cites: KEPLER: A Unified Model for Knowledge Embedding and Pre
