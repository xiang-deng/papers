With the development of machine learning, datasets for models are getting increasingly larger. This leads to increased data annotation costs and training time, which undoubtedly hinders the development of machine learning. To solve this problem, zero-shot learning is gaining considerable attention. With zero-shot learning, objects can be recognized or classified, even without having been seen before. Nevertheless, the accuracy of this method is still low, thus limiting its practical  Cites: QuAC: Question answering in context
