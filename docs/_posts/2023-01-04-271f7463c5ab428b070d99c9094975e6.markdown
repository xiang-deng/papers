Neural models with an encoder-decoder framework provide a feasible solution to Question Generation (QG). However, after analyzing the model vocabulary we find that current models (both RNN-based and pre-training based) have more than 23\% inflected forms. As a result, the encoder will generate separate embeddings for the inflected forms, leading to a waste of training data and parameters. Even worse, in decoding these models are vulnerable to irrelevant noise and they suffer from high …
