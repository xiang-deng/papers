In this paper, we introduce a machine reading comprehension model and how we built this model from scratch. Reading comprehension is a crucial requisite for artificial intelligence applications, such as Question-Answering systems, chatbots, virtual assistants etc. Reading comprehension task requires the highest complexity of natural language processing methods. In recent years, the transformer neural architecture could achieve the ability to solve high complexity tasks. To make these  Cites: ESTER: A Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset for Event
