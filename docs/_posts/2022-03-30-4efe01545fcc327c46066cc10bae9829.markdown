Despite the unprecedented pace at which technology is advancing nowadays, its wider use and application are often limited by the availability of low-cost, high- performance materials. The development of better materials is often costly and time- consuming due to the sheer size of the search space of a new material. Recently, data-driven materials design through machine learning techniques have gained much interest for its potential to accelerate the materials discovery and Cites: Generalized inner loop meta-learning
