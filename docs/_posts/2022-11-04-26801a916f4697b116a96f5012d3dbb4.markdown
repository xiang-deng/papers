Research on Dialogue State Tracking (DST) has achieved meaningful advancements in benchmark datasets. However, the generalization ability of DST models to handle unseen data robustly remains an issue. Hence, recent studies on DST with zero-shot and few-shot learning are reviewed in this paper. For a task-oriented dialogue system, DST is explained by introducing datasets and evaluation metrics. DST models could be categorized into four groups: DST based on a pre Cites: In-Context Learning for Few-Shot Dialogue State Tracking
