Zircon geochemistry provides a sensitive monitor of its parental magma composition. However, due to the complexity of the uptake of trace elements during zircon growth, identifying source magmas remains challenging, particularly for detrital grains whose petrological context is lost. We use a machine learning-based approach to explore the classifiers for zircon provenance, based on 3794 published, high-quality zircon trace element analyses compiled from I-, S-, and A-type granites.
