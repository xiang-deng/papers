Despite recent progress in abstractive summarization, models often generate summaries with factual errors. Numerous approaches to detect these errors have been proposed, the most popular of which are question answering (QA)-based factuality metrics. These have been shown to work well at predicting summarylevel factuality and have potential to localize errors within summaries, but this latter capability has not been systematically evaluated in past research.
