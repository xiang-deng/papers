Joint entity and relation extraction (JERE) is one of the most important tasks in information extraction. However, most existing works focus on sentence-level coarse-grained JERE, which have limitations in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we construct a large-scale document-level fine-grained JERE dataset DocRED-FE, which improves DocRED with Fine-Grained Entity Type. Specifically, we redesign a hierarchical entity type schema including 11 coarse-grained types and 119 fine …
