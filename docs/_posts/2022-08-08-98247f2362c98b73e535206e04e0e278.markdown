Machine learning systems may encounter unexpected problems when the data distribution changes in the deployment environment. A major reason is that certain combinations of domains and labels are not observed during training but appear in the test environment. Although various invariance-based algorithms can be applied, we find that the performance gain is often marginal. To formally analyze this issue, we provide a unique algebraic formulation of the combination shift problem based on Cites: Distributionally robust neural networks for group shifts: On the
