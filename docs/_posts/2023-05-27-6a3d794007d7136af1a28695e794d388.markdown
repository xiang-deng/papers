We train a language model (LM) to robustly answer multistep questions by generating and answering sub-questions. We propose Chain-of-Questions, a framework that trains a model to generate sub-questions and sub-answers one at a time by leveraging human annotated question decomposition meaning representation (QDMR). The key technical challenge is that QDMR only contains sub-questions but not answers to those sub-questions, so we treat sub-answers as latent Cites: MRQA 2019 Shared Task: Evaluating Generalization in Reading
