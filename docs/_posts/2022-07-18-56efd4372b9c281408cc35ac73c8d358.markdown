Over the past few years, different types of data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been widely adopted in various domains of science for generating predictive black-box models. However, because of their black-box nature, it is crucial to establish trust in these models before accepting them as accurate. One way of achieving this goal is through the implementation of a post-hoc interpretation scheme that can put forward the reasons behind a black-box model prediction.
