We evaluated and compared the mammographic density assessment of an artificial intelligence-based computer-assisted diagnosis (AI-CAD) program using inter-rater agreements between radiologists and an automated density assessment program. Between March and May 2020, 488 consecutive mammograms of 488 patients (56.210.9 years) were collected from a single institution. We assigned four classes of mammographic density based on BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Cites: Deep neural networks improve radiologists performance in breast
