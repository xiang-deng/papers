It is essential to develop innovative and original research questions/ideas for interdisciplinary research fields, such as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In this work, we focus on discussing how recent natural language generation (NLG) methodologies can be applied to promote the formulation of creative research questions. We collect and curate a dataset that contains texts of RQs and related work sections from HCI papers, and introduce a new NLG task of automatic HCI Cites: Question generation for question answering
