The present study explores the intricacies of causal relationship extraction, a vital component in the pursuit of causality knowledge. Causality is frequently intertwined with temporal elements, as the progression from cause to effect is not instantaneous but rather ensconced in a temporal dimension. Thus, the extraction of temporal causality holds paramount significance in the field. In light of this, we propose a method for extracting causality from the text that integrates both temporal and causal Cites: Joint reasoning for temporal and causal relations
