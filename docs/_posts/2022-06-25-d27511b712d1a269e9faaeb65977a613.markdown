By the recent success of deep learning, real-world applications of stereo depth estimation algorithms attracted the interest of many researchers. Using the available datasets, synthetic or real-world, the researchers begin analyzing their ideas for practical applications. In this thesis, a thorough analysis is performed of such an aim. The state-of-the-art stereo depth estimation algorithms are tried to be improved by incorporating attention mechanisms to the current networks and better initialization  Cites: Train short, test long: Attention with linear biases enables input
