Deep reinforcement learning has shown useful in the field of robotics but the black-box nature of deep neural networks impedes the applicability of deep reinforcement learning agents for real-world tasks. This is addressed in the field of explainable artificial intelligence, by developing explanation methods that aim to explain such agents to humans. Model trees as surrogate models have proven useful for producing explanations for black-box models used in real-world robotic applications  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
