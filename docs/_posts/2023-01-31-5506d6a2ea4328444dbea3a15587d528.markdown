Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have a large number of parameters and take significantly large hardware resources to compute, so edge devices struggle to run high-level networks. This paper proposes a novel method to reduce the parameters and FLOPs for computational efficiency in deep learning models. We introduce accuracy and efficiency coefficients to control the trade-off between the accuracy of the network and its computing efficiency. The proposed Rewarded meta-pruning  Cites: Good subnetworks provably exist: Pruning via greedy forward
