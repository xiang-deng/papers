Language models generate text based on successively sampling the next word. A decoding procedure based on nucleus (top-$ p $) sampling chooses from the smallest possible set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds the probability $ p $. In this work, we assess whether a top-$ p $ set is indeed aligned with its probabilistic meaning in various linguistic contexts. We employ conformal prediction, a calibration procedure that focuses on the construction of minimal prediction sets …
