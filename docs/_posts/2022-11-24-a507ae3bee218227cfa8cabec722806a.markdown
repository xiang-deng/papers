Geometry diagram parsing plays a key role in geometry problem solving, wherein the primitive extraction and relation parsing remain challenging due to the complex layout and between-primitive relationship. In this paper, we propose a powerful diagram parser based on deep learning and graph reasoning. Specifically, a modified instance segmentation method is proposed to extract geometric primitives, and the graph neural network (GNN) is leveraged to realize relation parsing and …
