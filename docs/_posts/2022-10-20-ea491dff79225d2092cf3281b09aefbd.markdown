Automatic data augmentation (AutoAugment) strategies are indispensable in supervised data-efficient training protocols of vision transformers, and have led to state-of-the-art results in supervised learning. Despite the success, its development and application on self-supervised vision transformers have been hindered by several barriers, including the high search cost, the lack of supervision, and the unsuitable search space. In this work, we propose AutoView, a self-regularized  Cites: Shortformer: Better language modeling using shorter inputs
