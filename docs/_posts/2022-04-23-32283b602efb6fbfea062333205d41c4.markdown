Code completion, one of the most useful features in the Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), can accelerate software development by suggesting the next probable tokens based on existing code in real-time. Recent studies have shown that recurrent neural networks based statistical language models can improve the performance of code completion tools through learning from large-scale software repositories. However, most of the existing approaches treat code completion as a Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
