The adversarial attack reveals the vulnerability of deep models by incurring test domain shift, while delusive attack relieves the privacy concern about personal data by injecting malicious noise into the training domain to make data unexploitable. However, beyond their successful applications, the two attacks can be easily defended by adversarial training (AT). While AT is not the panacea, it suffers from poor generalization for robustness. For the limitations of attack and defense, we Cites: Unlabeled data improves adversarial robustness
