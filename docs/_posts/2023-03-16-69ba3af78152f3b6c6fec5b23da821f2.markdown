Multi-turn response selection is a challenging task due to its high demands on efficient extraction of the matching features from abundant information provided by context utterances. Since incorporating syntactic information like dependency structures into neural models can promote a better understanding of the sentences, such a method has been widely used in NLP tasks. Though syntactic information helps models achieved pleasing results, its application in retrieval-based dialogue Cites: Jingfei Du
