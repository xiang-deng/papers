Most existing recommendation systems assume that items are independent and identically distributed. These methods only leverage user-item interactions as model input, while neglecting the relationship between items, leading to limited performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes the PEVGraphRec, which provides recommendations by utilizing Proximity-Effect-Value (PEV) similarity measurement to generate an item-item implicit network and employing graph neural  Cites: Recommender systems with social regularization
