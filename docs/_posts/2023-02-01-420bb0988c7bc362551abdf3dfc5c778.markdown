Diagnosing and cleaning datasets are crucial for building robust machine learning systems. However, identifying problems within large-scale datasets with real-world distributions is difficult due to the presence of complex issues, such as label errors or under-representation of certain types. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for identifying problematic data by utilizing a largely ignored source of information: a relational structure of data in the feature-embedded space. We develop an efficient Cites: Detecting Label Errors using Pre-Trained Language Models
