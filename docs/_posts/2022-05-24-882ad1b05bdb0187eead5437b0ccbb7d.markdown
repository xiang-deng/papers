Cross-domain sentiment classification (CDSC) aims to use the transferable semantics learned from the source domain to predict the sentiment of reviews in the unlabeled target domain. Existing studies in this task attach more attention to the sequence modeling of sentences while largely ignoring the rich domain-invariant semantics embedded in graph structures (ie, the part-of-speech tags and dependency relations). As an important aspect of exploring characteristics of … Cites: ‪A Fast and Accurate Dependency Parser using Neural Networks‬
