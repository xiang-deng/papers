Currently, multiturn dialogue models generate human-like responses based on pretrained language models given a dialogue history. However, most existing models simply concatenate dialogue histories, which makes it difficult to maintain a high degree of consistency throughout the generated text. We speculate that this is because the encoder ignores information about the hierarchical structure between sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel multiturn dialogue generation model Cites: Towards a human-like open-domain chatbot
