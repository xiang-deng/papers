Registration of brain scans with pathologies is difficult, yet important research area. The importance of this task motivated researchers to organize the BraTS-Reg challenge, jointly with IEEE ISBI 2022 and MICCAI 2022 conferences. The organizers introduced the task of aligning pre-operative to follow-up magnetic resonance images of glioma. The main difficulties are connected with the missing data leading to large, nonrigid, and noninvertible deformations. In this work, we …
