Code summaries are clear and concise natural language descriptions of program entities. Meaningful code summaries assist developers in better understanding. Code summarization refers to the task of generating a natural language summary from a code snippet. Most researches on code summarization focus on automatically generating summaries for methods or functions. However, in an object-oriented language such as Java, class is the basic programming unit rather than method. To  Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
