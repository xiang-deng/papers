For many automated perception and decision tasks, state-of-the-art performance may be obtained by algorithms that are too complex for their behavior to be completely understandable or predictable by human users, eg, because they employ large machine learning models. To integrate these algorithms into safety-critical decision and control systems, it is particularly important to develop methods that can promote trust into their decisions and help explore their failure modes. In this article, we …
