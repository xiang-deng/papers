SimRank is one of the most fundamental measures that evaluate the structural similarity between two nodes in a graph and has been applied in a plethora of data management tasks. These tasks often involve single-source SimRank computation that evaluates the SimRank values between a source node $ s $ and all other nodes. Due to its high computation complexity, single-source SimRank computation for large graphs is notoriously challenging, and hence recent studies resort to distributed …
