Federated learning allows many devices to collaborate in the training of machine learning models. As in traditional machine learning, there is a growing concern that models trained with federated learning may exhibit disparate performance for different demographic groups. Existing solutions to measure and ensure equal model performance across groups require access to information about group membership, but this access is not always available or desirable, especially under …
