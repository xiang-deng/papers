We propose a model-free reinforcement learning solution, namely the ASAP-Phi framework, to encourage an agent to fulfill a formal specification ASAP. The framework leverages a piece-wise reward function that assigns quantitative semantic reward to traces not satisfying the specification, and a high constant reward to the remaining. Then, it trains an agent with an actor-critic-based algorithm, such as soft actor-critic (SAC), or deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). Moreover, we prove Cites: Keeping your distance: Solving sparse reward tasks using self
