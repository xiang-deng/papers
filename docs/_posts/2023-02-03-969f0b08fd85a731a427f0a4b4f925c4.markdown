Few-shot knowledge graph completion (KGC) is an important and common task in real applications, which aims to predict unseen facts when only few samples are available for each relation in the knowledge graph (KG). Previous methods on few-shot KGC mainly focus on static KG, however, many KG in real-world applications are dynamic and develop over time. In this work, we consider few-shot KGC in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), where the fact may only hold for a specific …
