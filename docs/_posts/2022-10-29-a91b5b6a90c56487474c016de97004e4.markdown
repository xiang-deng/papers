We introduce question answering with a context in focus, a task that simulates a free interaction with a QA system. The user reads on a screen some information about a topic and they can follow-up with questions that can be either related or not to the topic; and the answer can be found in the document containing the screen content or from other pages. We call such information context. To study the task, we construct FOCUSQA, a dataset for answer sentence selection (AS2) with 12,165 unique Cites: Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering
