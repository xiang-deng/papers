Compositional generalization refers to a model s capability to generalize to newly composed input data based on the data components observed during training. It has triggered a series of compositional generalization analysis on different tasks as generalization is an important aspect of language and problem solving skills. However, the similar discussion on math word problems (MWPs) is limited. In this manuscript, we study compositional generalization in MWP solving. Specifically, we  Cites: Improving compositional generalization in semantic parsing
