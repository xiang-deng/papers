We describe a method to generate 3D architected materials based on mathematically parameterized human readable word input, offering a direct materialization of language. Our method uses a combination of a vector quantized generative adversarial network and contrastive language-image pre-training neural networks to generate images, which are translated into 3D architectures that are then 3D printed using fused deposition modeling into materials with varying rigidity.
