Automatic code generation, the task of generating new code snippets from existing code or comments, has long been of interest. Numerous code generation models have been proposed and proven on different benchmark datasets. However, little is known about whether this objective has been achieved and why code generation models effectively transform code sequences automatically. In other words, can we totally trust these automated code generation models? Consequently, there is a Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
