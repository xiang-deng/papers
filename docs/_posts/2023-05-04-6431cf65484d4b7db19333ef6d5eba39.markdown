With the wide application of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, how to make the contents generated by LLM accurate and credible becomes very important, especially in complex knowledge-intensive tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Search-in-the-Chain (SearChain) to improve the accuracy, credibility and traceability of LLM-generated content for multi-hop question answering, which is a typical complex knowledge-intensive task.
