Reinforcement learning (RL) under temporal logic typically suffers from slow propagation for credit assignment. Inspired by recent advancements called trajectory transformer in machine learning, the reinforcement learning under Temporal Logic (TL) is modeled as a sequence modeling problem in this paper, where an agent utilizes the transformer to fit the optimal policy satisfying the Finite Linear Temporal Logic (LTL f) tasks. To combat the sparse reward issue, the dense reward functions  Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
