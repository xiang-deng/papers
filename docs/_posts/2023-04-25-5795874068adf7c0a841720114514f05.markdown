Few-shot relation reasoning on knowledge graphs (FS-KGR) aims to infer long-tail data-poor relations, which has drawn increasing attention these years due to its practicalities. The pre-training of previous methods needs to manually construct the meta-relation set, leading to numerous labor costs. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is treated as a solution to tackle the issue, but still at an early stage for FS-KGR task. Moreover, most of the existing methods ignore leveraging the beneficial information  Cites: Multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning with reward shaping
