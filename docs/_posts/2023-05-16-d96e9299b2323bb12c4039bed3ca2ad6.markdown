Joint extraction of named entities and their relations has the advantage of avoiding cascading failures caused by falsely recognized named entities. Recent studies have focused on span classification modes to support end-to-end multiobjective learning. However, the enumeration of a large number of inaccurate entity spans creates a serious data imbalance and incurs high computational complexity. In this study, we propose a boundary regression model for joint entity and relation extraction, where a …
