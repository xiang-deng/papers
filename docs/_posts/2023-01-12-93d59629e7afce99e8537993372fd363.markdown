Encoder as a service is an emerging cloud service. Specifically, a service provider first pre-trains an encoder (ie, a general-purpose feature extractor) via either supervised learning or self-supervised learning and then deploys it as a cloud service API. A client queries the cloud service API to obtain feature vectors for its training/testing inputs when training/testing its classifier (called downstream classifier). A downstream classifier is vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are Cites: Certified robustness to adversarial word substitutions
