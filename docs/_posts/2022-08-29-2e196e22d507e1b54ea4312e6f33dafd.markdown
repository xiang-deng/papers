Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) integration combines symbolic reasoning with Neural Networks (NNs) for tasks requiring perception and reasoning. Most NeSy systems rely on continuous relaxation of logical knowledge and no discrete decisions are made within the model pipeline. Furthermore, these methods assume that the symbolic rules are given. In this paper, we propose Deep Symbolic Learning (DSL), a NeSy system that learns NeSy-functions, ie, the composition of a (set of) perception  Cites: End-to-end differentiable proving
