Abstract Knowledge graph embedding learns distributed low-dimensional representations for the elements in knowledge graphs, so that knowledge can be conveniently integrated into various tasks and smart systems. Recently, convolutional neural network has been introduced to embedding technique and obtained impressive achievements in link prediction task. ConvKB, a recently proposed method, captured the global dimension-wise interactions in facts with the …
