As automated machine learning (AutoML) systems continue to progress in both sophistication and performance, it becomes important to understand thehow andwhy of human-computer interaction (HCI) within these frameworks, both current and expected. Such a discussion is necessary for optimal system design, leveraging advanced data-processing capabilities to support decision-making involving humans, but it is also key to identifying the opportunities and risks Cites: AlphaD3M: Machine learning pipeline synthesis
