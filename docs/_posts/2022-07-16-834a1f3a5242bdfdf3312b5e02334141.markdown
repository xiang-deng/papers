This PhD project leverages advancements in multimodal large language models to build an inclusive collaboration feedback loop, in order to facilitate the automated detection, modeling, and feedback for participants developing general collaboration skills. This topic is important given the role of collaboration as an essential 21st century skill, the potential to ground large language models within learning theory and real-world practice, and the expressive potential of transformer models to  Cites: Coauthor: Designing a human-ai collaborative writing dataset for
