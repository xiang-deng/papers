Recently, eXplainable AI (XAI) research has focused on the use of counterfactual explanations to address interpretability, algorithmic recourse, and bias in AI system decision-making. The proponents of these algorithms claim they meet users requirements for counterfactual explanations. For instance, many claim that the output of their algorithms work as explanations because they prioritise plausible , actionable or causally important features in their generated counterfactuals  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
