Multilevel optimization has been widely adopted as a mathematical foundation for a myriad of machine learning problems, such as hyperparameter optimization, meta-learning, and reinforcement learning, to name a few. Nonetheless, implementing multilevel optimization programs oftentimes requires expertise in both mathematics and programming, stunting research in this field. We take an initial step towards closing this gap by introducing Betty, a high-level software library for gradient-based  Cites: Generalized inner loop meta-learning
