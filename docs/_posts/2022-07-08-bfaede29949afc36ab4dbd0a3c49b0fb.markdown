Knowledge Graph Completion has been widely studied recently to complete missing elements within triples via mainly modeling graph structural features, but performs sensitive to the sparsity of graph structure. Relevant texts like entity names and descriptions, acting as another expression form for Knowledge Graphs (KGs), are expected to solve this challenge. Several methods have been proposed to utilize both structure and text messages with two encoders, but only achieved limited  Cites: Dynamic Anticipation and Completion for Multi-Hop Reasoning
