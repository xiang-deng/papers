Abstract The prediction for Multivariate Time Series (MTS) explores the interrelationships among variables at historical moments, extracts their relevant characteristics, and is widely used in finance, weather, complex industries and other fields. Furthermore, it is important to construct a digital twin system. However, existing methods do not take full advantage of the potential properties of variables, which results in poor predicted accuracy. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Fused …
