Abstract Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to map the knowledge graph into a low-dimensional continuous vector space and provide a unified underlying representation for downstream tasks. Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has been widely used in knowledge graph embedding because of its powerful feature extraction ability, and most KGE models based on GNN use aggregation operations to extract potential information from the triples. Unfortunately, they only emphasize …
