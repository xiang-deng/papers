Most of the existing quantum-inspired models are based on amplitude-phase embedding to model natural language, which maps words into Hilbert space. In quantum-computing theory, the vectors corresponding to quantum states are all complex values, so there is a gap between these two areas. Presently, complex-valued neural networks have been studied, but their practical applications are few, let alone in the downstream tasks of natural language processing such as sentiment  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations. arXiv 2018
