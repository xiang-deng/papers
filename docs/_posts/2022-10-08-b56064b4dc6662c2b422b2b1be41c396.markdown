Machine learning techniques using neural networks have achieved promising success for time-series data classification. However, the models that they produce are challenging to verify and interpret. In this paper, we propose an explainable neural-symbolic framework for the classification of time-series behaviors. In particular, we use an expressive formal language, namely Signal Temporal Logic (STL), to constrain the search of the computation graph for a neural network. We …
