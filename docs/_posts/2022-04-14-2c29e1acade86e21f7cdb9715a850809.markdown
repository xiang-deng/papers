Abstract Recent advances in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have stimulated and paved the way toward the widespread introduction of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). This has opened new opportunities for smart roads, intelligent traffic safety, and traveler comfort. Autonomous Vehicles have become a highly popular research topic in recent years because of their significant capability to reduce road accidents and human injuries. This paper is an attempt to Cites: Empirical evaluation of gated recurrent neural networks on
