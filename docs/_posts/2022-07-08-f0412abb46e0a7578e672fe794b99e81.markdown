Molecular interaction prediction is essential in various applications including drug discovery and material science. The problem becomes quite challenging when the interaction is represented by unmapped relationships in molecular networks, namely molecular interaction, because it easily suffers from (i) insufficient labeled data with many false-positive samples, and (ii) ignoring a large number of biological entities with rich information in the knowledge graph. Most of the existing methods cannot  Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
