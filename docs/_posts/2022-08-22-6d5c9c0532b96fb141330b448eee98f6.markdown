The introduction and ever-growing size of the transformer deep-learning architecture have had a tremendous impact not only in the field of natural language processing but also in other fields. The transformer-based language models have contributed to a renewed interest in commonsense knowledge due to the abilities of deep learning models. Recent literature has focused on analyzing commonsense embedded within the pre-trained parameters of these models and embedding missing commonsense Cites: Opt: Open pre-trained transformer language models
