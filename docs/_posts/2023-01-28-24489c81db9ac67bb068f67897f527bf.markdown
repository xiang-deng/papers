Recent studies on heterogeneous information network (HIN) embedding-based recommendations have encountered challenges. These challenges are related to the data heterogeneity of the associated unstructured attribute or content (eg, text-based summary/description) of users and items in the context of HIN. In order to address these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel approach of semantic-aware HIN embedding-based recommendation, called SemHE4Rec. In our …
