AMR-to-text is one of the key techniques in the NLP community that aims at generating sentences from the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Since AMR was proposed in 2013, the study on AMR-to-Text has become increasingly prevalent as an essential branch of structured data to text because of the unique advantages of AMR as a high-level semantic description of natural language. In this paper, we provide a brief survey of AMR-to-Text. Firstly, we
