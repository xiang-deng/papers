Interpretable machine learning (IML) is concerned with the behavior and the properties of machine learning models. Scientists, however, are only interested in the model as a gateway to understanding the modeled phenomenon. We show how to develop IML methods such that they allow insight into relevant phenomenon properties. We argue that current IML research conflates two goals of model-analysis--model audit and scientific inference. Thereby, it remains unclear if model …
