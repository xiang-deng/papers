Utilizing Visualization-oriented Natural Language Interfaces (V-NLI) as a complementary input modality to direct manipulation for visual analytics can provide an engaging user experience. It enables users to focus on their tasks rather than worrying about operating the interface to visualization tools. In the past two decades, leveraging advanced natural language processing technologies, numerous V-NLI systems have been developed both within academic research and commercial Cites: Spider: A Large-Scale Human-Labeled Dataset for Complex and
