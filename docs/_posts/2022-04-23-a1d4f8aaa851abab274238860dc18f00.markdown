In chemoinformatics and medicinal chemistry, machine learning has evolved into an important approach. In recent years, increasing computational resources and new deep learning algorithms have put machine learning onto a new level, addressing previously unmet challenges in pharmaceutical research. In silico approaches for compound activity predictions, de novo design, and reaction modeling have been further advanced by new algorithmic developments and the emergence of big data in Cites:   Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
