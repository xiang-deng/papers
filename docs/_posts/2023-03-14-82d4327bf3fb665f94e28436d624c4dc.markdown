Minimizing safety incidents and their consequent damage has been a high priority for industries. Incident reports capture many details such as causes, failures as well as consequences. However, automated analysis of repositories of incident reports has remained a challenge. In this paper, we propose to apply knowledge-based NLP algorithms to automatically identify similar safety incidents from repositories of historical industrial incidents. We devise a notion of similarity among industrial …
