We propose a novel three-layer neural network architecture with threshold activations for tabular data classification problems. The hidden layer units correspond to trainable neurons with arbitrary weights and biases and a step activation. These neurons are logically equivalent to threshold logic functions. The output layer neuron is also a threshold function that implements a conjunction of the hidden layer threshold functions. This neural network architecture can leverage state  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
