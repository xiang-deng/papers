Using deep learning models to diagnose cancer from histology data presents several challenges, including image size, stain variation, and labels ambiguity. In addition, cancer grading and localization of regions of interest (ROIs) in these images normally relies on both image-and pixel-level labels, the latter requiring a costly annotation process. Deep weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL) methods provide different strategies for low-cost training of deep learning models.
