ABSTRACT Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs), as a kind of powerful graph representation learning methods on heterogeneous graphs, have attracted increasing attention of many researchers. Although, several existing libraries have supported HGNNs, they just provide the most basic models and operators. Building and benchmarking various downstream tasks on HGNNs is still painful and time consuming with them. In this paper, we will introduce Open-HGNN, an open-source Cites: OpenKE: An Open Toolkit for Knowledge Embedding
