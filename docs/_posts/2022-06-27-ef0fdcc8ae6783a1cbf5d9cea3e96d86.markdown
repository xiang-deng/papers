Information extraction from semi-structured documents is crucial for frictionless business-to-business (B2B) communication. While machine learning problems related to Document Information Extraction (IE) have been studied for decades, many common problem definitions and benchmarks do not reflect domain-specific aspects and practical needs for automating B2B document communication. We review the landscape of Document IE problems, datasets and benchmarks. We highlight the …
