One of the fundamental problems in deep learning research is how to design neural network models to incorporate logic and symbolic operations. Although deep neural network models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple natural language processing benchmarks, those black-box models can hardly provide explanations for their inner mechanisms. They still lack the ability to perform systematic reasoning like human beings and generalize poorly to out-of-distribution …
