Long‐lived nonspecular meteor echoes backscattered from meteor trail nonfield‐aligned irregularities (NFAIs) were observed sporadically at high latitudes. In this study, we employ the observations by the all‐sky radar of Meteor and ionospheric Irregularity Observation System (MIOS) at Ledong (18.4° N, 109° E) in October 2018, January, April, and July 2019, to investigate the occurrences of meteor trail NFAIs at low latitudes. A deep learning method was developed to identify long‐lived meteor …
