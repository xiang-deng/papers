Accurate mortality prediction allows Intensive Care Units (ICUs) to adequately benchmark clinical practice and identify patients with unexpected outcomes. Traditionally, simple statistical models have been used to assess patient death risk, many times with sub-optimal performance. On the other hand Deep Learning holds promise to positively impact clinical practice by leveraging medical data to assist diagnosis and prediction, including mortality prediction. However, as the question of Cites: Recurrent neural networks for multivariate time series with missing
