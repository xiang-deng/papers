Abstract Knowledge base question answering aims to answer a question over a knowledge base. Multi-hop knowledge base question answering is a challenging task because it requires multi-step reasoning according to the question to get the answer. Existing models infer the answer over a static subgraph or attend to different parts of the question through an intermediate signal. The former obtains limited semantic information, and the latter provides limited reasoning due to the weak …
