Commonsense question-answering (QA) methods combine the power of pre-trained Language Models (LM) with the reasoning provided by Knowledge Graphs (KG). A typical approach collects nodes relevant to the QA pair from a KG to form a Working Graph (WG) followed by reasoning using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This faces two major challenges:(i) it is difficult to capture all the information from the QA in the WG, and (ii) the WG contains some irrelevant nodes from the KG.
