Software architectures for conversational robots typically consist of multiple modules, each designed for a particular processing task or functionality. Some of these modules are developed for the purpose of making decisions about the next action that the robot ought to perform in the current context. Those actions may relate to physical movements, such as driving forward or grasping an object, but may also correspond to communicative acts, such as asking a question to the human user.
