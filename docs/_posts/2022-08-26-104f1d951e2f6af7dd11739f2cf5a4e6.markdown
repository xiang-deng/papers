Dynamic contextualised word embeddings represent the temporal semantic variations of words. We propose a method for learning dynamic contextualised word embeddings by time-adapting a pretrained Masked Language Model (MLM) using time-sensitive templates. Given two snapshots $ C_1 $ and $ C_2 $ of a corpora taken respectively at two distinct timestamps $ T_1 $ and $ T_2 $, we first propose an unsupervised method to select (a) pivot terms related to both $ C_1 $ and $ C_2 Cites: Making Pre-trained Language Models Better Few-shot Learners
