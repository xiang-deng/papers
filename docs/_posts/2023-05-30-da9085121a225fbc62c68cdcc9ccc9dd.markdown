Abstract Knowledge Graph encodes human-readable information and knowledge in graph format. Triples, denoted by (h, r, t), are basic elements of a KG, where h and t are head and tail entities while r is the relation connecting them. Both manual effort by domain experts and automated information extraction algorithms have contributed to the creation of many existing Knowledge Graphs today. However, given the limited information accessible to each individual and the limitation of algorithms, it is nearly …
