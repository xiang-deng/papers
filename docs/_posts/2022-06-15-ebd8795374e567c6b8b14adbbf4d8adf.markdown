Understanding behavior from neural activity is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. It has practical applications in building robust brain-machine interfaces, human-computer interaction, and assisting patients with neurological disabilities. Despite the ever-growing demand driven by the applications, neural action decoding methods still require laborious manual annotations. Furthermore, a different model must be trained for each new individual, requiring even more annotation and overwhelming …
