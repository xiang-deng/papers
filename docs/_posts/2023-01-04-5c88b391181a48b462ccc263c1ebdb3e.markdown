Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been demonstrated to be competitive in recommender systems. In most of the exiting MOEA-based recommendation algorithms, individuals in the population are usually represented in the form of matrix encoding, where rows represent users and columns represent recommended items. However, as the number of users and items increases, the search space of these MOEA-based methods increases exponentially. To tackle the  Cites: Pareto-efficient hybridization for multi-objective recommender
