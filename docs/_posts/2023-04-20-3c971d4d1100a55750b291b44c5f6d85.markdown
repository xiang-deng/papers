Code generation is widely regarded as a key technique for elevating the automation and ultimate quality of software development. Nevertheless, existing code generation approaches usually concentrate on a single stage of the software development process (ie, the coding stage) and do not take into consideration other stages that are crucial in reducing complexity and ensuring quality assurance. The organization and conduction of multiple stages in software development require collaborative Cites: Toolformer: Language models can teach themselves to use tools
