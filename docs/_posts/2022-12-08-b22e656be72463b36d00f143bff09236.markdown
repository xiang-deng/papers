For users to trust model predictions, they need to understand model outputs, particularly their confidencecalibration aims to adjust (calibrate) models confidence to match expected accuracy. We argue that the traditional calibration evaluation does not promote effective calibrations: for example, it can encourage always assigning a mediocre confidence score to all predictions, which does not help users distinguish correct predictions from wrong ones.
