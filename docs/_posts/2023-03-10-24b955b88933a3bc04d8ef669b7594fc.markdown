Abstract Next Point-Of-Interest (POI) recommendation aim to predict users  next visits by mining their movement patterns. Existing works attempt to extract spatial–temporal relationships from historical check-ins; however, the following critical factors have not been adequately considered:(1) structured features implied in trajectory that reflect individual visit tendency;(2) collaborative signals from other users and (3) dynamic user preference. To this end, we jointly take into full consideration the graph …
