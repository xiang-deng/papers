This review gives an overview of the current state of deep learning research in breast cancer imaging. Breast imaging plays a major role in detecting breast cancer at an earlier stage, as well as monitoring and evaluating breast cancer during treatment. The most commonly used modalities for breast imaging are digital mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Nuclear medicine imaging techniques are used for detection and classification of axillary Cites: Deep neural networks improve radiologists performance in breast
