A key component of generating text from modern language models (LM) is the selection and tuning of decoding algorithms. These algorithms determine how to generate text from the internal probability distribution generated by the LM. The process of choosing a decoding algorithm and tuning its hyperparameters takes significant time, manual effort, and computation, and it also requires extensive human evaluation. Therefore, the identity and hyperparameters of such decoding  Cites: Truncation Sampling as Language Model Desmoothing
