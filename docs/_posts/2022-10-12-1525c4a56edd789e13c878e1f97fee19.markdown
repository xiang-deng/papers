Abstract Semantic parsing aims to convert natural language utterances to logical forms. A critical challenge for constructing semantic parsers is the lack of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a data synthesis and iterative refinement framework for neural semantic parsing, which can build semantic parsers without annotated logical forms. We first generate a naive corpus by sampling logic forms from knowledge bases and synthesizing their canonical utterances. Then, we further  Cites: StructVAE: Tree-structured latent variable models for semi
