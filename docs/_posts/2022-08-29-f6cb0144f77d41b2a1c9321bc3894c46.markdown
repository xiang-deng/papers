Abstract The challenge of Lexical Entailment Recognition (LER) aims to identify the is-a relation between words. This problem has recently received attention from researchers in the field of natural language processing because of its application to varied downstream tasks. However, almost all prior studies have only focused on datasets that include single words; thus, how to handle compound words effectively is still a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel method called LERC (Lexical  Cites: Recognizing textual entailment: Models and applications
