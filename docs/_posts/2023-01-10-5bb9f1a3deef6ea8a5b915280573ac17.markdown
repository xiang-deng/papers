Reinforcement Learning aims to train autonomous agents in their interaction with the environment by means of maximizing a given reward signal; in the last decade there has been an explosion of new algorithms, which make extensive use of hyper-parameters to control their behaviour, accuracy and speed. Often those hyper-parameters are fine-tuned by hand, and the selected values may change drastically the learning performance of the algorithm; furthermore, it happens to train multiple  Cites: Online hyperparameter optimization by real-time recurrent learning
