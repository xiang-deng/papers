Multistores are data management systems that enable query processing across different and heterogeneous databases; besides the distribution of data, complexity factors like schema heterogeneity and data replication must be resolved through integration and data fusion activities. Our multistore solution relies on a dataspace to provide the user with an integrated view of the available data and enables the formulation and execution of GPSJ queries. In this paper, we propose a technique to  Cites: From databases to dataspaces: a new abstraction for information
