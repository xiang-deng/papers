Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) is a popular evaluation metric for binary classifiers. In this paper, we discuss techniques to segment the AUC-ROC along human-interpretable dimensions. AUC-ROC is not an additive/linear function over the data samples, therefore such segmenting the overall AUC-ROC is different from tabulating the AUC-ROC of data segments. To segment the overall AUC-ROC, we must first solve an\emph {attribution} problem to identify … Cites: ‪Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList‬
