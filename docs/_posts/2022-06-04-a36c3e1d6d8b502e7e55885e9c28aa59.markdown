Anchors [Ribeiro et al.(2018)] is a post-hoc, rule-based interpretability method. For text data, it proposes to explain a decision by highlighting a small set of words (an anchor) such that the model to explain has similar outputs when they are present in a document. In this paper, we present the first theoretical analysis of Anchors, considering that the search for the best anchor is exhaustive. We leverage this analysis to gain insights on the behavior of Anchors on simple models, including  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
