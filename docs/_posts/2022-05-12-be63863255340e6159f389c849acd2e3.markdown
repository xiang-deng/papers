Event detection is an extremely important step for extracting events, and its goal is to detect the occurrences of events and categorize them.

However, both approaches encounter two problems:(1) Enriched feature information obtained from external tools probably introduces unnecessary errors.(2) Ignoring the phenomenon of event co-occurrence in a sentence degrades the performance of event detection Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
