Online learning systems have multiple data repositories in the form of transcripts, books and questions. To enable ease of access, such systems organize the content according to a well defined taxonomy of hierarchical nature (subject-chapter-topic). The task of categorizing inputs to the hierarchical labels is usually cast as a flat multi-class classification problem. Such approaches ignore the semantic relatedness between the terms in the input and the tokens in the hierarchical labels. Alternate Cites: REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training
