GraphSAGE is a widely-used graph neural network for classification, which generates node embeddings in two steps: sampling and aggregation. In this paper, we introduce causal inference into the GraphSAGE sampling stage, and propose Causal GraphSAGE (C-GraphSAGE) to improve the robustness of the classifier. In C- GraphSAGE, we use causal bootstrapping to obtain a weighting between the target node s neighbors and their label. Then, these weights are used to resample the Cites: Advancing graphsage with a data-driven node sampling
