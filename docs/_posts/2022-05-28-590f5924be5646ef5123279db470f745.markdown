This work introduces ATTEMPT (Attentional Mixture of Prompt Tuning), a new modular, multi-task, and parameter-efficient language model (LM) tuning approach that combines knowledge transferred across different tasks via a mixture of soft prompts while keeping original LM unchanged. ATTEMPT interpolates a set of prompts trained on large-scale source tasks and a newly initialized target task prompt using instance-wise attention computed by a lightweight sub-network trained … Cites: ‪Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways‬
