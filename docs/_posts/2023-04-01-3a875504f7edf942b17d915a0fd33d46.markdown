In this paper, we report our methods and experiments for the TREC Conversational Assistance Track (CAsT) 2022.

Before the first ranking stage of a multi-stage retrieval pipeline, we propose a mixed-initiative query reformulation module, which achieves query reformulation based on  Cites: Can you unpack that? learning to rewrite questions-in-context
