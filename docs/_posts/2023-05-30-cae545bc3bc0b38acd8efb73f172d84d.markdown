Automatically solving math word problems (MWPs) is a challenging task for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) research, which aims to answer the problem with a mathematical expression. Many existing solutions simply model the MWP as a sequence of words, which is far from precise solving. To this end, we turn to how humans solve MWPs. Humans read the problem part-by-part and capture dependencies between words for a thorough understanding and infer the expression  Cites: Unit dependency graph and its application to arithmetic word
