In recent years, deep models have achieved remarkable success in many vision tasks. Unfortunately, their performance largely depends on intensive training samples. In contrast, human beings typically perform hybrid learning, eg, spontaneously integrating structured knowledge for cross-domain recognition or on a much smaller amount of data samples for few-shot learning. Thus it is very attractive to extend hybrid learning for the computer vision tasks by seamlessly integrating Cites: Compositional Learning of Embeddings for Relation Paths in
