Large-scale model sizes and expensive computing costs cause the challenge of deploying and applying large pre-trained models. Hence, this paper presents a novel Triple Concepts Attention Mechanism and a lightweight TCAMixer model for edge devices to classify texts. Furthermore, the TCAMixer abstracts textual concepts in a human way, which is unmatched by other counterparts such as pNLP-Mixer (a projection-based MLP-Mixer model for Nature Language Processing) and Cites: Pay attention to mlps
