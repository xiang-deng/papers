Given weak supervision from image-or video-caption pairs, we address the problem of grounding (localizing) each object word of a ground-truth or generated sentence describing a visual input. Recent weakly-supervised approaches leverage region proposals and ground words based on the region attention coefficients of captioning models. To predict each next word in the sentence they attend over regions using a summary of the previous words as a query, and then ground the word by selecting …
