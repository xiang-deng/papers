Structured sentiment analysis is a newly proposed task, which aims to summarize the overall sentiment and opinion status on given texts, ie, the opinion expression, the sentiment polarity of the opinion, the holder of the opinion, and the target the opinion towards. In this work, we investigate a transition-based model for end-to-end structured sentiment analysis task. We design a transition architecture which supports the recognition of all the possible opinion quadruples in one shot. Based on Cites: Adaptive recursive neural network for target-dependent twitter
