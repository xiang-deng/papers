Boolean satisfiability (SAT) plays a key role in diverse areas such as spanning planning, inference, data mining, testing and optimization. Apart from the classical problem of checking Boolean satisfiability, generating random satisfying assignments has attracted significant theoretical and practical interests over the past years. In practical applications, usually a large number of satisfying assignments for a given Boolean formula are needed, the generation of which turns out to be a
