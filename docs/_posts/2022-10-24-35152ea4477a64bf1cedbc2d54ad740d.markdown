This paper 1 presents an overview of a data augmented classification and multi-span (multiple) answer system for extracting key information from academic publications. This study consists of two sections:(a) implementing a new fine-tuned model to solve the multiple answer extraction issue (b) reporting results of sub-classification in various RF-EMF topics. In our previous study, it has been found that the essential cause of the low performance of the extractive question answering (EQA) system for …
