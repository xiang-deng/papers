While data visualization plays a crucial role in gaining insights from data, generating answers over complex visualizations from natural language questions is far from an easy task. Mainstream approaches reduce data visualization queries to a semantic parsing problem, which either relies on expensive-to-annotate supervised training data that pairs natural language questions with logical forms, or weakly supervised models that incorporate a larger corpus but fail on long-tailed queries without Cites: What does BERT look at?
