This research aims to present a composite approach to characterizing the intra-annual and interannual variability in inlet throat width and understanding its mechanism (how, when, and why it varies). The techniques used include remote sensing imagery analysis, spectral and cross-spectral analyses, correlation analyses, and random forest variable importance. The Da Dien River mouth (DDRM), which is located in southern Central Vietnam and experiences a strong annual signal …
