Code example is a crucial part of good documentation. It helps the developers to understand the documentation easily and use the corresponding code unit (eg, method) properly. However, many official documentation still lacks (good) code example and it is one of the common documentation issues as found by several studies. Hence in this paper, we consider automatic code example generation for documentation, a direction less explored by the existing research. We employ …
