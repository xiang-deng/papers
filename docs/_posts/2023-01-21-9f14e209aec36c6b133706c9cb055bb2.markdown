The real-world use cases of Machine Learning (ML) have exploded over the past few years. However, the current computing infrastructure is insufficient to support all realworld applications and scenarios. Apart from high efficiency requirements, modern ML systems are expected to be highly reliable against hardware failures as well as secure against adversarial and IP stealing attacks. Privacy concerns are also becoming a first-order issue. This article summarizes the main challenges in agile Cites: A full-stack search technique for domain optimized deep learning
