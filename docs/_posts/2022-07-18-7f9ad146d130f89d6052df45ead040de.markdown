To make a trade-off between accuracy and inference speed in real-time applications on the unmanned mobile platform, a novel neural network, named Parallel Dual Branch Network (PDBNet), is proposed. Firstly, a multi-scale module, namely Parallel Dual Branch (PDB), is designed to extract complete information. PDB module consists of two parallel branches to remove detailed low-level information and high-level semantic information while maintaining few parameters. Then, based on the  Cites: ESPNetv2: A Light-weight, Power Efficient, and General Purpose
