Incorporating knowledge graphs in recommendation systems is promising as knowledge graphs can be a side information for recommendation systems to alleviate the sparsity and the cold start problems. However, existing works essentially assume that side information (ie, knowledge graphs) is completed, which may lead to sub-optimal performance. Meanwhile, semantic hierarchies implied in applications are prevalent, and many existing approaches fail to model this semantic …
