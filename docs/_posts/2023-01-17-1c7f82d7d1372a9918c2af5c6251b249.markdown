Sample weighting is widely used in deep learning. A large number of weighting methods essentially utilize the learning difficulty of training samples to calculate their weights. In this study, this scheme is called difficulty-based weighting. Two important issues arise when explaining this scheme. First, a unified difficulty measure that can be theoretically guaranteed for training samples does not exist. The learning difficulties of the samples are determined by multiple factors including noise level …
