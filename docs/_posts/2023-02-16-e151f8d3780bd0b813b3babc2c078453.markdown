Intelligent manufacturing applications and agent-based implementations are scientifically investigated due to the enormous potential of industrial process optimization. The most widespread data-driven approach is the use of experimental history under test conditions for training, followed by execution of the trained model. Since factors, such as tool wear, affect the process, the experimental history has to be compiled extensively. In addition, individual machine noise implies that the …
