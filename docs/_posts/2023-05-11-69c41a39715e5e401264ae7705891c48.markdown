Latent variable modeling in non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT) is a promising approach to mitigate the multimodality problem. In the previous works, they added an auxiliary model to estimate the posterior distribution of the latent variable conditioned on the source and target sentences. However, it causes several disadvantages, such as redundant information extraction in the latent variable, increasing parameters, and a tendency to ignore a part of the information from the  Cites: Syntactically Supervised Transformers for Faster Neural Machine
