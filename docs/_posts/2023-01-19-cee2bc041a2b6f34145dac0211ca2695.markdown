The use of learning-based techniques to achieve automated software vulnerability detection has been of longstanding interest within the software security domain. These data-driven solutions are enabled by large software vulnerability datasets used for training and benchmarking. However, we observe that the quality of the data powering these solutions is currently ill-considered, hindering the reliability and value of produced outcomes.
