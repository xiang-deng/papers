Inflorescence thinning is the primary method for crop regulation to obtain high-quality table grapes in viticulture. It is essential to reduce labor dependency and associated costs by using mechanical thinning. To achieve precision mechanical thinning, visual detection of table grape inflorescence and spikelet is an important part of the process. In this article, an end-to-end method based on the improved YOLOV5s and Kmeans algorithm under the complex growing environment is proposed to detect …
