Augmentations and other transformations of data, either in the input or latent space, are a critical component of modern machine learning systems. While these techniques are widely used in practice and known to provide improved generalization in many cases, it is still unclear how data manipulation impacts learning and generalization. To take a step toward addressing the problem, this thesis focuses on understanding and leveraging data augmentation and alignment …
