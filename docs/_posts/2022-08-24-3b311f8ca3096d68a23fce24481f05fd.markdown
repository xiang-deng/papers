With the advent of Industry 4.0, more data is exploited to improve efficiency in production and to enable a cost-effective maintenance approach called predictive maintenance. In a production ecosystem, assets are maintained based on their corresponding internal condition. Often, there is no known ground truth or label for the internal condition of the components, especially for high-dimensional data. Furthermore, the initial degradation condition of the assets differs from each other Cites: On the opportunities and risks of foundation models
