Underwater acoustic target recognition is an intractable task due to the complex acoustic source characteristics and sound propagation patterns. Limited by insufficient data and narrow information perspective, recognition models based on deep learning seem far from satisfactory in practical underwater scenarios. Although underwater acoustic signals are severely influenced by distance, channel depth, or other factors, annotations of relevant information are often nonuniform, incomplete  Cites: Making Pre-trained Language Models Better Few-shot Learners
