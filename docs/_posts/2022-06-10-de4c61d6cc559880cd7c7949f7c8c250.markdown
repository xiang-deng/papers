Blocking the catalytic activity of urease has been shown to have a key role in different diseases as well as in different agricultural applications. A vast array of molecules have been tested against ureases of different species, but the clinical translation of these compounds has been limited due to challenges of potency, chemical and metabolic stability as well as promiscuity against other proteins. The design and development of new compounds greatly benefit from insights from previously tested …
