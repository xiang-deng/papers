Bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), as one of the effective networks for sequence labeling tasks, is widely used in named entity recognition (NER). However, the sequential nature of Bi-LSTM and the inability to recognize multiple sentences at the same time make it impossible to obtain overall information. In this paper, to make up for the shortcomings of Bi-LSTM in extracting global information, we propose a hierarchical context model embedded with sentence-level and document-level …
