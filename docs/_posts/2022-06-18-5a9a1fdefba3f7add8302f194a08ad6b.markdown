Black-box nature of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models do not allow users to comprehend and sometimes trust the output created by such model. In AI applications, where not only the results but also the decision paths to the results are critical, such black-box AI models are not sufficient. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this problem and defines a set of AI models that are interpretable by the users. Recently, several number of XAI models have been to address the issues  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
