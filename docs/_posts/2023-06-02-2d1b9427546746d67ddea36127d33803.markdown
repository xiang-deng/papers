Space agencies execute complex satellite operations that need to be supported by the technical knowledge contained in their extensive information systems. Knowledge bases (KB) are an effective way of storing and accessing such information at scale. In this work we present a system, developed for the European Space Agency (ESA), that can answer complex natural language queries, to support engineers in accessing the information contained in a KB that models the orbital Cites: Unlocking compositional generalization in pre-trained models
