Manual code reviews and static code analyzers are the traditional mechanisms to verify if source code complies with coding policies. However, these mechanisms are hard to scale. We formulate code compliance assessment as a machine learning (ML) problem, to take as input a natural language policy and code, and generate a prediction on the code s compliance, non-compliance, or irrelevance. This can help scale compliance classification and search for policies not covered by traditional Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
