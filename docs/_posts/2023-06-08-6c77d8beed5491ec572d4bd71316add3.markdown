Accurately and rapidly predicting the multi-conditions characteristics of turbines is fundamental for realizing efficient energy conversion and optimal layout schemes. Based on supervised graph learning approaches, this work is dedicated to establishing a fast multidisciplinary prediction model for gas turbines. The research target is a gas turbine blade with complex cooling channels. An Aerodynamic Strength Prediction Graph neural network (ASP-GNN) is proposed to predict the …
