A key challenge in artificial intelligence is the well-known tradeoff between the interpretability of an algorithm, and its accuracy. Designing interpretable, highly accurate AI models is considered essential to broad acceptance of AI technology, and is the focus of the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) community. We report on the design of a new deep neural network that achieves improved interpretability without sacrificing accuracy. Our design is a hybrid deep learning algorithm based in  Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
