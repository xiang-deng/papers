Policy evaluation is a central problem in batch reinforcement learning. It refers to the assessment of a given decision policy using logged data. Practical methods for policy evaluation typically involve some form of function approximation so as to relieve issues caused by the enormous scales of real-world systems and the length of planning horizons. The thesis is primarily concerned with statistical analysis of policy evaluation and show how function approximation improves the efficacy of …
