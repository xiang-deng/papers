Large pretrained language models (PLMs) are often domain-or task-adapted via fine-tuning or prompting. Finetuning requires modifying all of the parameters and having enough data to avoid overfitting while prompting requires no training and few examples but limits performance. Instead, we prepare PLMs for data-and parameter-efficient adaptation by learning to learn the difference between general and adapted PLMs. This difference is expressed in terms of model weights and sublayer structure Cites: Muppet: Massive multi-task representations with pre-finetuning
