Knowledge graph entity typing aims to infer entities  missing types in knowledge graphs which is an important but under-explored issue. This paper proposes a novel method for this task by utilizing entities  contextual information. Specifically, we design two inference mechanisms: i) N2T: independently use each neighbor of an entity to infer its type; ii) Agg2T: aggregate the neighbors of an entity to infer its type. Those mechanisms will produce multiple inference results, and an exponentially Cites: Ultra-fine entity typing
