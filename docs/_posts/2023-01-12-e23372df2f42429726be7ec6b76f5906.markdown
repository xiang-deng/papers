In this paper, we study the problem of {\em $ k $-center clustering with outliers}. The problem has many important applications in real world, but the presence of outliers can significantly increase the computational complexity. Though a number of methods have been developed in the past decades, it is still quite challenging to design quality guaranteed algorithm with low complexity for this problem. Our idea is inspired by the greedy method, Gonzalez s algorithm, that was developed for solving Cites: Selection via proxy: Efficient data selection for deep learning
