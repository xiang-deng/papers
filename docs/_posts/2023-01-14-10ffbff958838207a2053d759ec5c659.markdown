As a powerful tool for processing high-dimensional data, tensor decomposition has been widely used in context-aware recommendation. Most of the current tensor decomposition-based recommendation models use CP decomposition or Tucker decomposition. In practical recommendation applications, fewer parameters limit the performance of CP decomposition, and the high-order tensor kernel makes the computational complexity of Tucker decomposition exponential. In order to improve …
