Abstract The Remote Associates Test (RAT) is a word association retrieval task that consists of a series of problems, each with three seemingly unrelated prompt words. The subject is asked to produce a single word that is related to all three prompt words. In this paper, we provide support for a theory in which the RAT assesses a person s ability to retrieve relevant word associations from longterm memory. We present a computational model of humans solving the RAT and investigate how prior  Cites: Glove: Global vectors for word representation
