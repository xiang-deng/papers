In this paper, we define goal legibility in a multi-agent path-finding setting. We consider a set of identical agents moving in an environment and tasked with reaching a set of locations that need to be serviced. An observer monitors their movements from a distance to identify their destinations as soon as possible. Our algorithm constructs a set of paths for the agents, one to each destination, that overlap as little as possible while satisfying a budget constraint. In this way, the …
