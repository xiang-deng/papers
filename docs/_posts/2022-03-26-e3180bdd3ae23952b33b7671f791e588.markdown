Biomedical entity linking is an important research problem for many downstream tasks, such as biomedical intelligent question answering, information retrieval, and information extraction. Biomedical entity linking is the task of mapping mentions in medical texts to standard entities in a given knowledge base. Recently, BERT-based models have achieved state-of-the-art results on the biomedical entity linking task. Although this type of method is effective, it brings challenges for fine-tuning and Cites: Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for
