Knowledge graph embedding is a representation learning technique that projects entities and relations in a knowledge graph to continuous vector spaces. Embeddings have gained a lot of uptake and have been heavily used in link prediction and other downstream prediction tasks. Most approaches are evaluated on a single task or a single group of tasks to determine their overall performance. The evaluation is then assessed in terms of how well the embedding approach Cites: Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text
