Abstract With their Discovery of Inference Rules from Text (DIRT) algorithm, Lin and Pantel (2001) made a seminal contribution to the field of rule acquisition from text, by adapting the distributional hypothesis of Harris (1954) to patterns that model binary relations such as X treat Y, where patterns are implemented as syntactic dependency paths. DIRT s relevance is renewed in today s neural era given the recent focus on interpretability in the field of natural language processing. We propose a novel take … Cites: ‪A two level model for context sensitive inference rules‬
