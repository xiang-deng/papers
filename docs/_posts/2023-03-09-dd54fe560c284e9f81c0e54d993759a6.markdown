The prevalence of fake news on social media has led to major sociopolitical issues. Thus, the need for automated fake news detection is more important than ever. In this work, we investigated the interplay between news content and users posting behavior clues in detecting fake news by using state-of-the-art deep learning approaches, such as the convolutional neural network (CNN), which involves a series of filters of different sizes and shapes (combining the original sentence matrix  Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
