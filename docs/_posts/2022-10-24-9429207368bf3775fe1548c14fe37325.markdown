In the evolution of agriculture to its next stage, Agriculture 5.0, artificial intelligence will play a central role. Controlled-environment agriculture, or CEA, is a special form of urban and suburban agricultural practice that offers numerous economic, environmental, and social benefits, including shorter transportation routes to population centers, reduced environmental impact, and increased productivity. Due to its ability to control environmental factors, CEA couples well with computer vision  Cites: Can Rationalization Improve Robustness?
