Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied on a variety of real-world applications, such as social recommendation. However, existing GNN-based models on social recommendation suffer from serious problems of generalization and oversmoothness, because of the underexplored negative sampling method and the direct implanting of the off-the-shelf GNN models. In this paper, we propose a succinct multi-network GNN-based neural model (NeMo) for social recommendation Cites: Recommender systems with social regularization
