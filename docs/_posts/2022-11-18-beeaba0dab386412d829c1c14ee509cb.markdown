Abstract Knowledge graph (KG) completion aims to infer new facts from incomplete knowledge graphs. Most existing solutions focus on learning from time-aware fact triples and ignore the spatial information. In reality, knowledge graphs can evolve with time as well as the changing locations, such as the flight domain. Therefore, integrating spatiotemporal information into knowledge graph representation is important for the knowledge graph completion. To address this problem, this paper Cites: Do Pre-trained Models Benefit Knowledge Graph Completion? A
