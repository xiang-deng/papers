One of the key AI tools for textual corpora exploration is natural language question-answering (QA). Unlike keyword-based search engines, QA algorithms receive and process natural language questions and produce precise answers to these questions, rather than long lists of documents that need to be manually scanned by the users. State-of-the-art QA algorithms based on DNNs were successfully employed in various domains. However, QA in the genealogical domain is still Cites: Injecting Numerical Reasoning Skills into Language Models
