[Objective] This paper proposes a knowledge graph model based on negative sampling and joint relational contexts, aiming to improve the quality of current translation-based knowledge graph embedding models.[Methods] Firstly, we extracted the neighbors of the target instances from the original knowledge graph to generate the context vector. Then, we decided the properties of adjacent relations, which also provided information on the nature or type of a given entity. Third, we …
