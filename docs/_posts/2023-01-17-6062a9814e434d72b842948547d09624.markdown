Data on software vulnerabilities, products, and exploits are typically collected from multiple non-structured sources. Valuable information, eg, on which products are affected by which exploits, is conveyed by matching data from those sources, ie, through their relations. In this paper, we leverage this simple albeit unexplored observation to introduce a statistical relational learning (SRL) approach for the analysis of vulnerabilities, products, and exploits. In particular, we focus on the …
