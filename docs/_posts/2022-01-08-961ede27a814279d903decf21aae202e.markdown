Recently, pre-trained programming language models such as CodeBERT have demonstrated substantial gains in code search. Despite their success, they rely on the availability of large amounts of parallel data to fine-tune the semantic mappings between queries and code. This restricts their practicality in domain-specific languages with relatively scarce and expensive data. In this paper, we propose CDCS, a novel approach for domain-specific code search. CDCS employs a transfer Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
