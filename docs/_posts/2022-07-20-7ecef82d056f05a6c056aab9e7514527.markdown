Neural-symbolic learning, aiming to combine the perceiving power of neural perception and the reasoning power of symbolic logic together, has drawn increasing research attention. However, existing works simply cascade the two components together and optimize them isolatedly, failing to utilize the mutual enhancing information between them. To address this problem, we propose DeepLogic, a framework with joint learning of neural perception and logical Cites: Compositional attention networks for machine reasoning
