Query performance prediction (QPP) methods, which aim to predict the performance of a query, often rely on evidences in the form of different characteristic patterns in the distribution of Retrieval Status Values (RSVs). However, for neural IR models, it is usually observed that the RSVs are often less reliable for QPP because they are bounded within short intervals, different from the situation for statistical models. To address this limitation, we propose a model-agnostic QPP framework that gathers …
