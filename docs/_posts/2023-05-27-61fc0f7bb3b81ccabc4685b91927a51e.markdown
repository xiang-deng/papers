Multisource point of interest (POI) attribute alignment is the consistent processing of heterogeneous attribute values from different data sources pointing to the same POI data, which is one of the key technologies to achieve geospatial data fusion. However, semantic heterogeneity problems of synonyms and homographs among different POI data sources are encountered, which makes multisource POI data fusion challenging. This paper proposes a multisource POI attribute alignment Cites: Pre-Trained Models: Past, Present and Future
