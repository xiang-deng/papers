To explain the prediction result of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model based on a given sample, LIME [1] and its derivatives have been proposed to approximate the local behavior of the DNN model around the data point via linear surrogates. Though these algorithms interpret the DNN by finding the key features used for classification, the random interpolations used by LIME would perturb the explanation result and cause the instability and inconsistency between repetitions of LIME computations.
