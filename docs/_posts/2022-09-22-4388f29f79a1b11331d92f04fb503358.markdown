This document served as my study guide for the Berkeley DB prelim (syllabus here). Much of the text is copy-pasted from the original papers. Some of the text is copy-pasted from Michael Whittaker s notes and self-contained paper summaries, both of which I am very grateful for. A miniscule fraction of the text is copy-pasted from old CS262A and CS286 notes, scattered across the internet.
