We study the problem of classification with a reject option for a fixed predictor, applicable in natural language processing.\ignore {where many correct labels are often possible} We introduce a new problem formulation for this scenario, and an algorithm minimizing a new surrogate loss function. We provide a complete theoretical analysis of the surrogate loss function with a strong $ H $-consistency guarantee. For evaluation, we choose the\textit {decontextualization} task, and Cites: Selective question answering under domain shift
