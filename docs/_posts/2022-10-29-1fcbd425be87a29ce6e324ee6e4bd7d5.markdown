Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to help developers automatically patch software bugs. However, current state-of-the-art traditional and learning-based APR techniques face the problem of limited patch variety, failing to fix complicated bugs. This is mainly due to the reliance on bug-fixing datasets to craft fix templates or directly predict potential patches. Large Pre-Trained Language Models (PLMs), trained using billions of text/code tokens, can potentially help avoid this issue. Very …
