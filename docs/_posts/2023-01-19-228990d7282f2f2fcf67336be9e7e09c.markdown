Deep neural networks have achieved good progresses in smoke segmentation, but it is a challenging task to accurately segment smoke images due to smoke semi-transparency and large variance. To improve performance, we propose a Cross-scale Mixed-attention Network (CMNet) by designing multi-scale and mixed attention modules. We first concatenate the results of average and maximum pooling along each axis to learn powerful attention coefficients, which are used to weight the …
