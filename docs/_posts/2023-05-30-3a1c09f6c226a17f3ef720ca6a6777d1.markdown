Increasing demands in software industry and scarcity of software engineers motivates researchers and practitioners to automate the process of software generation and configuration. Large scale automatic software generation and configuration is a very complex and challenging task. In this proposal, we set out to investigate this problem by breaking down automatic software generation and configuration into two different tasks. In first task, we propose to synthesize software …
