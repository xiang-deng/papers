Event extraction (EE) methods are widely used in the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) to help objects obtain the key information from messages shared by other objects. Existing supervised EE methods can only extract predefined events and can hardly extract events with unseen event types. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised EE method based on the idea of semantic role labeling. However, after extracting all possible events from a given message text, some of these events face …
