To leverage the copious amount of data from source tasks and overcome the scarcity of the target task samples, representation learning based on multi-task pretraining has become a standard approach in many applications. However, up until now, most existing works design a source task selection strategy from a purely empirical perspective. Recently,\citet {chen2022active} gave the first active multi-task representation learning (A-MTRL) algorithm which adaptively samples from source …
