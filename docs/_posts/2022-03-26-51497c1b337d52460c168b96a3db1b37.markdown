Accurate and timely short-term forecasting services of precipitation variable are significant for people s lives and property security. The data-driven approaches demonstrate promising performance in the extrapolation of precipitation. In this paper, we proposed a spatiotemporal prediction model, namely the Spatial Temporal Long Short-Term Memory based on the self-attentive mechanism (ST-LSTM-SA). This model enables better aggregation of sequence features inspired by proposed Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
