Dual-encoder-based neural retrieval models achieve appreciable performance and complement traditional lexical retrievers well due to their semantic matching capabilities, which makes them a common choice for hybrid IR systems. However, these models exhibit a performance bottleneck in the online query encoding step, as the corresponding query encoders are usually large and complex Transformer models. In this paper we investigate heterogeneous dual-encoder models, where the …
