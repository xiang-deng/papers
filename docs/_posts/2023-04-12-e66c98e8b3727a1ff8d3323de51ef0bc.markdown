Human experts write summaries using different techniques, including rewriting a sentence in the document or fusing multiple sentences to generate a summary sentence. These techniques are flexible and thus difficult to be imitated by any single method. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive model, GEMINI, that integrates a rewriter and a fuser to mimic the sentence rewriting and fusion techniques, respectively. GEMINI adaptively chooses to rewrite a specific document  Cites: Fast Abstractive Summarization with Reinforce-Selected Sentence
