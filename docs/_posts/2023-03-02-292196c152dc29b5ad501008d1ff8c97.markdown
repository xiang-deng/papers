This paper explains the generalization power of a deep neural network (DNN) from the perspective of interactive concepts. Many recent studies have quantified a clear emergence of interactive concepts encoded by the DNN, which have been observed on different DNNs during the learning process. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the generalization power of each interactive concept, and we use the generalization power of different interactive concepts to explain the generalization …
