Existing tools for prompt programming provide little support to prompt programmers. Consequently, as prompts become more complex, they can be hard to read, understand, and edit. In this work, we draw on modern integrated development environments for traditional programming to improve the editor experience of prompt programming. We describe methods for understanding the semantically meaningful structure of natural language prompts in the absence of a rigid formal grammars, and Cites: AI Chains: Transparent and Controllable Human-AI Interaction by
