The current progress of building this architecture and several novel points in the implementation are introduced in this paper. We conducted experiments on the Statement Predictor, which is a component part of the architecture. The results show that an appropriately trained machine learning model can predict the type of noisy statement with high accuracy. Cites: Break-it-fix-it: Unsupervised learning for program repair
