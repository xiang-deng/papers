During the continuous evolution of one organism s ancestry, its genes accumulate extensive experiences and knowledge, enabling newborn descendants to rapidly adapt to their specific environments. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel machine learning paradigm\textit {Learngene} to enable learning models to incorporate three key characteristics of genes.(i) Accumulating: the knowledge is accumulated during the continuous learning of an\textbf {ancestry model}.(ii) …
