Many relational datasets, including relational databases, feature links of different types (eg, actors act in movies, users rate movies), known as multi-relational, heterogeneous, or multi-layer graphs. Edge types/graph layers are often incompletely labeled. For example, IMDb lists Tom Cruise as a cast member of Mission Impossible, but not as its star. Inferring latent layers is useful for relational prediction tasks (eg predict Tom Cruise s salary or his presence in other movies) Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
