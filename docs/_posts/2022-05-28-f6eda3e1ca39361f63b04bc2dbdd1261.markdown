Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) facilitates domain-independent discovery of relational facts from large corpora. The technique well suits many open-world natural language understanding scenarios, such as automatic knowledge base construction, open-domain question answering, and explicit reasoning. Thanks to the rapid development in deep learning technologies, numerous neural OpenIE architectures have been proposed and achieve considerable performance improvement.
