The major challenge in the task of entity alignment (EA) lies in the heterogeneity of the knowledge graph. The traditional solution to EA is to first map entities to the same space via knowledge embedding and then calculate the similarity between entities from different knowledge graphs [37]. However, these methods mainly rely on manually labeled seeds of entity alignment, where this limits their applicability. Some researchers have begun using pseudo-labels rather than seeds for unsupervised …
