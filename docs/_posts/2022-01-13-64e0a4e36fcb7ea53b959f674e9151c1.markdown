Automatic music emotion recognition (MER) has received increased attention in areas of music information retrieval and user interface development. Music emotion variation detection (or dynamic MER) captures also temporal changes of emotion, and emotional content in music is expressed as a series of valence-arousal predictions. One of the issues in MER is extraction of emotional characteristics from audio signal. We propose a deep neural network based solution for mining music Cites: Convolutional recurrent neural networks for music classification
