Although humans are capable of learning new tasks without forgetting previous ones, most neural networks fail to do so because learning new tasks could override the knowledge acquired from previous data. In this work, we alleviate this issue by proposing a novel Efficient Perturbation Inference and Expandable Network (EPIE-Net), which dynamically expands lightweight task-specific decoders for new classes and utilizes a mixed-label uncertainty strategy to improve the robustness.
