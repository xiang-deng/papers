$ k $-Nearest neighbor machine translation ($ k $ NN-MT) has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to non-parametrically adapt to new translation domains. By using an upstream NMT model to traverse the downstream training corpus, it is equipped with a datastore containing vectorized key-value pairs, which are retrieved during inference to benefit translation. However, there often exists a significant gap between upstream and downstream domains, which hurts the retrieval accuracy and  Cites: Efficient Nearest Neighbor Language Models
