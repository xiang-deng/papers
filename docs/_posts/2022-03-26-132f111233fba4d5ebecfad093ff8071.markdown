Drought is a major cause of agricultural losses worldwide. Climate change will intensify drought episodes threatening agricultural sustainability. Gaining insights into drought response mechanisms is vital for crop adaptation to climate emergency. To date, only few studies report comprehensive analyses of plant metabolic adaptation to drought. Here, we present a multifactorial metabolomic study of early- mid drought stages in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We sampled root and Cites: BRL1 and BRL3 are novel brassinosteroid receptors that function
