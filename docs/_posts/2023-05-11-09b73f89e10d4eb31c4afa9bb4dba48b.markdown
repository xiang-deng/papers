Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing is the task of translating a sentence to an AMR semantic graph which captures the basic meaning of the sentence, and is empowered by pre-trained Transformer models recently. These models encode the syntactic and semantic knowledge implicitly through self-supervised pre-trained tasks. We argue that encoding the syntactic and semantic knowledge explicitly is beneficial to AMR parsing and can improve data efficiency. Specifically, syntactic  Cites: Syntax-enhanced pre-trained model
