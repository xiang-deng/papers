There have been wide ranges of innovations in sentiment analysis in recent past, with most effective ones involving use of various word embeddings methods for analysis of sentiments. GloVe and Word2Vec are acclaimed to be two most frequently used. A common problem with simple pre-trained embedding methods is that these ignore information related to sentiments of input texts and further depend on large text corpus for training purpose and generation of relevant vectors which is Cites: Learning sentiment-specific word embedding for twitter sentiment
