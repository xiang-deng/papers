The semantic similarity of graph-based meaning representations, such as Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), is typically assessed using graph matching algorithms, such as SMATCH (Cai and Knight, 2013). However, SMATCH suffers from NP-completeness, making its large-scale application, eg, for AMR clustering or semantic search, infeasible. To mitigate this issue, we propose SMARAGD (Synthesized sMatch for accurate and rapid AMR graph distance). We show the Cites: Neuro-symbolic program synthesis
