Abstract Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) aims to generate a concise summary for a collection of documents on the same topic. However, the fixed input length and a large number of redundancies in source documents make the pre-trained models less effective in MDS. In this paper, we propose a two-stage abstractive MDS model based on Predicate-Argument Structure (PAS). In the first stage, we divide the redundancy of documents into intra-sentence redundancy and inter-sentence  Cites: Hierarchical transformers for multi-document summarization
