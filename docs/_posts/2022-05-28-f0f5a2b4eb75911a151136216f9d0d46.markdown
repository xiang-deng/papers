Recent advances in unsupervised graph representation learning (UGRL) have primarily been driven by new paradigms, such as contrastive learning (CL) and novel reconstruction-based approaches. However, understanding of how dataset properties, often assumed true for vision datasets, apply to URGL remains limited. By taking a datacentric perspective, we investigate augmentation invariance and recoverability, as well as dataset separability in graph classification.
