In this work, we propose a simple method that applies a large language model (LLM) to large-scale retrieval in zero-shot scenarios. Our method, Language language model as Retriever (LameR) is built upon no other neural models but an LLM, while breaking up brute-force combinations of retrievers with LLMs and lifting the performance of zero-shot retrieval to be very competitive on benchmark datasets. Essentially, we propose to augment a query with its potential answers by prompting  Cites: Learning To Retrieve Prompts for In-Context Learning
