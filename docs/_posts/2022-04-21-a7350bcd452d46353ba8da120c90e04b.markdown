Recently, reinforcement learning combined with deep neural network technology has achieved remarkable success in various fields such as board games such as Go and chess, computer games such as Atari and StartCraft, and robot object manipulation tasks. However, such deep reinforcement learning describes states, actions, and policies in vector representation. Therefore, the existing deep reinforcement learning has some limitations in generality and interpretability of the learned policy, and it is Cites: Neural logic machines
