Short text classification is a crucial and challenging aspect of Natural Language Processing. For this reason, there are numerous highly specialized short text classifiers. However, in recent short text research, State of the Art (SOTA) methods for traditional text classification, particularly the pure use of Transformers, have been unexploited. In this work, we examine the performance of a variety of short text classifiers as well as the top performing traditional text classifier. We furtherÂ â€¦
