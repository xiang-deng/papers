In this paper, we propose a comprehensive linguistic study aimed at assessing the implicit behaviour of one of the most prominent Neural Language Model (NLM) based on Transformer architectures, BERT [15], when dealing with a particular source of noisy data, namely essays written by L1 Italian learners containing a variety of errors targeting grammar, orthography and lexicon. Differently from previous works, we focus on the pre-training stage and we devise two evaluation …
