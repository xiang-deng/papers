Abstract Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is to learn how to represent the low dimensional vectors for entities and relations based on the observed triples. When dealing with surrounding information, recent models either ignore the interactions between triples within the knowledge graph or use too many parameters to take the surrounding information into the model. Besides, the asymmetric information in the surrounding triples deserves further investigation. In this paper, we propose an Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
