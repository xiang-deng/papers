In this paper, we propose SCANING, an unsupervised framework for paraphrasing via controlled noise injection. We focus on the novel task of paraphrasing algebraic word problems having practical applications in online pedagogy as a means to reduce plagiarism as well as ensure understanding on the part of the student instead of rote memorization. This task is more complex than paraphrasing general-domain corpora due to the difficulty in preserving critical information for solution consistency  Cites: Neural Syntactic Preordering for Controlled Paraphrase Generation
