Reasoning on temporal knowledge graphs, which aims to infer new facts from existing knowledge, has attracted extensive attention and in-depth research recently. One of the important tasks of reasoning on temporal knowledge graphs is entity prediction, which focuses on predicting the missing objects in facts at current time step when relevant histories are known. The problem is that, for entity prediction task on temporal knowledge graphs, most previous studies pay attention to aggregating …
