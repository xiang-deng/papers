Recently, reasoning methodologies for uncertain knowledge graphs have been extensively proposed. However, symbolic reasoning for uncertain knowledge graphs has rarely been studied. There are multiple paths between the subject and object entities, which makes it a challenge to deduce the confidence of triples base on symbolic reasoning. In this paper, we develop a causal-based symbolic reasoning framework UKGCSR, which aims to infer object entity and triple confidence through  Cites: Dynamic Anticipation and Completion for Multi-Hop Reasoning
