We investigate the potential of GPT-4~\cite {gpt4} to perform Neural Architecture Search (NAS)--the task of designing effective neural architectures. Our proposed approach,\textbf {G} PT-4\textbf {I} nformed\textbf {N} eural\textbf {A} rchitecture\textbf {S} earch (GINAS), leverages the generative capabilities of GPT-4 as a black-box optimiser to quickly navigate the architecture search space, pinpoint promising candidates, and iteratively refine these candidates to improve performance. We …
