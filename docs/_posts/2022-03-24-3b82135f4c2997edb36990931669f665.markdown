In this thesis, focus is set on spatiotemporal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) for facial expression recognition (FER) in videos. Over the last decade, deep learning has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm for FER and spatiotemporal recognition. The transition of research focus toward deep learning was also a regression from spatiotemporal to spatial methods. Models are increasingly dependent on the quantity of training data, favouring 2D-image datasets over videos Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
