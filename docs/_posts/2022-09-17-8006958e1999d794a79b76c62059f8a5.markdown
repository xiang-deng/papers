There has been an explosion of interest in designing various Knowledge Graph Neural Networks (KGNNs), which achieve state-of-the-art performance and provide great explainability for recommendation. The promising performance is mainly resulting from their capability of capturing high-order proximity messages over the knowledge graphs. However, training KGNNs at scale is challenging due to the high memory usage. In the forward pass, the automatic differentiation engines (eg Cites: Smore: Knowledge graph completion and multi-hop reasoning in
