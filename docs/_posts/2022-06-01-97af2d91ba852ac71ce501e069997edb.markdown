Globally, breast cancer is considered a major reason for women s morality. Earlier and accurate identification of breast cancer is essential to increase survival rates. Therefore, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) models are developed to help radiologists in the detection of mammographic lesions. Presently, machine-learning (ML) and deep-learning (DL) models are widely employed in the disease diagnostic process. In this view, this paper designs a novel CAD using optimal region growing … Cites: ‪Deep neural networks improve radiologists’ performance in breast …‬
