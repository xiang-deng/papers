Most recent graph clustering methods rely on pretraining graph auto-encoders using self-supervision techniques (pretext task) and fine-tuning based on pseudo-supervision (main task). However, the transition from self-supervision to pseudo-supervision has never been studied from a geometric perspective. Herein, we establish the first systematic exploration of the latent manifolds  geometry under the deep clustering paradigm; we study the evolution of their intrinsic dimension and …
