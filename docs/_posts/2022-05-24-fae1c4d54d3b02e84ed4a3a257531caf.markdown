Attributed graph clustering aims to partition nodes of a graph structure into different groups. Recent works usually use variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) to make the node representations obey a specific distribution. Although they have shown promising results, how to introduce supervised information to guide the representation learning of graph nodes and improve clustering performance is still an open problem. In this article, we propose a Collaborative Decision-Reinforced … Cites: ‪Adaptive Graph Encoder for Attributed Graph Embedding‬
