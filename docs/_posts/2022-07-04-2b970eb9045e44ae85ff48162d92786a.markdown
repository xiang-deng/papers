In this paper, we address the Online Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OUDA) problem and propose a novel multi-stage framework to solve real-world situations when the target data are unlabeled and arriving online sequentially in batches. Most of the traditional manifold-based methods on the OUDA problem focus on transforming each arriving target data to the source domain without sufficiently considering the temporal coherency and accumulative statistics among the arriving Cites: Understanding self-training for gradual domain adaptation
