Network representation learning, also known as network embedding, aims to learn the low-dimensional representations of vertices while capturing and preserving the network structure. For real-world networks, the edges that represent some important relationships between the vertices of a network may be missed and may result in degenerated performance. The existing methods usually treat missing edges as negative samples, thereby ignoring the true connections between two vertices in a …
