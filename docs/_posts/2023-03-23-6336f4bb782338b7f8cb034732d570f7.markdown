Automated Program Repair (APR) aspires to automatically generate patches for an input buggy program. Traditional APR tools typically focus on specific bug types and fixes through the use of templates, heuristics, and formal specifications. However, these techniques are limited in terms of the bug types and patch variety they can produce. As such, researchers have designed various learning-based APR tools with recent work focused on directly using Large Language Models (LLMs) for APR Cites: Dawn Drain, Neel Sundaresan, Jian Yin, Daxin Jiang, and Ming
