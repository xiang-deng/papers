Logical reasoning plays a very important role in Natural Language Understanding. In recent years, research on logical reasoning has shown a booming trend. Previous works either construct graphs to perform implicit reasoning or augment labeled training data with consistent symbol logical rules. In this paper, we combine the advantages of both graph based implicit reasoning and symbolic logic based consistent transformation in a deep learning framework.
