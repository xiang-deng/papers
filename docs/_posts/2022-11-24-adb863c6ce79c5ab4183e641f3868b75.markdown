Contextual synonym knowledge is crucial for those similarity-oriented tasks whose core challenge lies in capturing semantic similarity between entities in their contexts, such as entity linking and entity matching. However, most Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) lack synonym knowledge due to inherent limitations of their pre-training objectives such as masked language modeling (MLM). Existing works which inject synonym knowledge into PLMs often suffer from two severe problems:(i)  Cites: KEPLER: A Unified Model for Knowledge Embedding and Pre
