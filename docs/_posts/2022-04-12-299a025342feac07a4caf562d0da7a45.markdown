This paper presents the results of research on supervised extractive text summarisation for scientific articles. We show that a simple sequential tagging model based only on the text within a document achieves high results against a simple classification model. Improvements can be achieved through additional sentence- level features, though these were minimal. Through further analysis, we show the potential of the sequential model relying on the structure of the document depending Cites: Neural summarization by extracting sentences and words
