Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) has attracted significant attention from the research community. Many recent LNL methods rely on the assumption that clean samples tend to have small loss . However, this assumption always fails to generalize to some real-world cases with imbalanced subpopulations, ie, training subpopulations varying in sample size or recognition difficulty. Therefore, recent LNL methods face the risk of misclassifying those informative samples (eg, hard Cites: Examining and Combating Spurious Features under Distribution Shift
