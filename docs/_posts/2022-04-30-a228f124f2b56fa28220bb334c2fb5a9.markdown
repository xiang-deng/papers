The remarkable progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) brought about by deep learning, particularly with the recent advent of large pre-trained neural language models, is brought into scrutiny as several studies began to discuss and report potential biases in NLP applications. Bias in NLP is found to originate from latent historical biases encoded by humans into textual data which gets perpetuated or even amplified by NLP algorithm. We present a survey to comprehend bias in Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
