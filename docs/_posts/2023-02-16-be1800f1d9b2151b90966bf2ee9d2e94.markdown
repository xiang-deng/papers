Context: In recent years, leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques has become one of the main solutions to tackle many software engineering (SE) tasks, in research studies (ML4SE). This has been achieved by utilizing state-of-the-art models that tend to be more complex and black-box, which is led to less explainable solutions that reduce trust and uptake of ML4SE solutions by professionals in the industry. Objective: One potential remedy is to offer explainable AI (XAI) methods to provide Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
