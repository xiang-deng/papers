Hydrogen production is an active area of research with a vast amount of available scientific literature. However, this data is unstructured and scattered, making its utilization difficult from an academic and industrial point of view. This work aims to develop a recommendation system to identify optimal process conditions and catalyst information using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. To this end, full-text articles were extracted using the Elsevier API key followed by a custom XML … Cites: ‪Reading tea leaves: How humans interpret topic models‬
