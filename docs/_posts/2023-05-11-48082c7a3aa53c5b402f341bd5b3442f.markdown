Unit testing plays an essential role in detecting bugs in functionally-discrete program units (eg, methods). Manually writing high-quality unit tests is time-consuming and laborious. Although the traditional techniques are able to generate tests with reasonable coverage, they are shown to exhibit low readability and still cannot be directly adopted by developers in practice. Recent work has shown the large potential of large language models (LLMs) in unit test generation. By being pre Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
