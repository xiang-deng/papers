The growing need for trustworthy machine learning has led to the blossom of interpretability research. Numerous explanation methods have been developed to serve this purpose. However, these methods are deficiently and inappropriately evaluated. Many existing metrics for explanations are introduced by researchers as by-products of their proposed explanation techniques to demonstrate the advantages of their methods. Although widely used, they are more or less accused of problems Cites: Do feature attribution methods correctly attribute features?
