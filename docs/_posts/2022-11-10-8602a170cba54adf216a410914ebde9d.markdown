Semantic Machines (SM) have introduced the use of the dataflow (DF) paradigm to dialogue modelling, using computational graphs to hierarchically represent user requests, data, and the dialogue history [Semantic Machines et al. 2020]. Although the main focus of that paper was the SMCalFlow dataset (to date, the only dataset with  native  DF annotations), they also reported some results of an experiment using a transformed version of the commonly used MultiWOZ dataset [Budzianowski et al …
