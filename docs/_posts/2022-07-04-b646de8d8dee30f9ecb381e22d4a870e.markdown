Real-world knowledge graphs (KG) are mostly incomplete. The problem of recovering missing relations, called KG completion, has recently become an active research area. Knowledge graph (KG) embedding, a low-dimensional representation of entities and relations, is the crucial technique for KG completion. Convolutional neural networks in models such as ConvE, SACN, InteractE, and RGCN achieve recent successes. This paper takes a different architectural view and proposes
