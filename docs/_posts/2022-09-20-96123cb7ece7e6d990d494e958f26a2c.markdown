Automatic identification of coding best practices can scale the development of code and application analyzers. We present Doc2BP, a deep learning tool to identify coding best practices in software documentation. Natural language descriptions are mapped to an informative embedding space, optimized under the dual objectives of binary and few shot classification. The binary objective powers general classification into known best practice categories using a deep learning classifier. The few shot Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
