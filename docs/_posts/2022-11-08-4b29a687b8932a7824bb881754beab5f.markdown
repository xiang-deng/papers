Diabetes is an illness that happens with a high level of glucose in the body, and can harm the retina, causing permanent loss vision or diabetic retinopathy. The fundus oculi method comprises detecting the eyes to perform a pathology test. In this research, we implement a method to predict the progress of diabetic retinopathy. There is a research gap that exists for the detection of diabetic retinopathy progression employing deep learning models. Therefore, in this research, we …
