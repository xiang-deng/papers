ChatGPT is a conversational artificial intelligence that is a member of the generative pre-trained transformer of the large language model family. This text generative model was fine-tuned by both supervised learning and reinforcement learning so that it can produce text documents that seem to be written by natural intelligence. Although there are numerous advantages of this generative model, it comes with some reasonable concerns as well. This paper presents a machine learning-based Cites: DetectGPT: Zero-shot machine-generated text detection using
