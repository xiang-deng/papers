We present an approach to efficiently and effectively adapt a masked image modeling (MIM) pre-trained vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) for object detection, which is based on our two novel observations:(i) A MIM pre-trained vanilla ViT can work surprisingly well in the challenging object-level recognition scenario even with random sampled partial observations, eg, only 25%~ 50% of the input sequence.(ii) In order to construct multi-scale representations for object detection, a random Cites: A Simple Single-Scale Vision Transformer for Object Localization
