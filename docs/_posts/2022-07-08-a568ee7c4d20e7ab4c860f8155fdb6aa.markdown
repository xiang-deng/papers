Transfer learning refers to the transfer of knowledge or information from a relevant source task to a target task. However, most existing works assume both tasks are sampled from a stationary task distribution, thereby leading to the sub-optimal performance for dynamic tasks drawn from a non-stationary task distribution in real scenarios. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we study a more realistic and challenging transfer learning setting with dynamic tasks, ie, source and target tasks  Cites: Understanding self-training for gradual domain adaptation
