The discovery of new photovoltaic materials can facilitate technological progress in clean energy and hence benefit overall societal development. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies integrated with domain knowledge are revolutionizing the traditional trial-and-error research paradigm that is associated with high costs, inefficiency, and significant human effort. This review provides an overview of the recent progress in the data-driven discovery of novel photovoltaic Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
