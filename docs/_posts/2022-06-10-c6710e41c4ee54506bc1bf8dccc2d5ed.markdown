The visual relationship recognition (VRR) task aims at understanding the pairwise visual relationships between interacting objects in an image. These relationships typically have a long-tail distribution due to their compositional nature. This problem gets more severe when the vocabulary becomes large, rendering this task very challenging. This paper shows that modeling an effective message-passing flow through an attention mechanism can be critical to tackling the compositionality and …
