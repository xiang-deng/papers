In text classification tasks, using traditional char granularity or word granularity information to encode context information into the same parameter space cannot effectively extract enough text feature information, and the expressive ability of text semantic information is also relatively weak. In order to solve this problem, this paper adopts the embedding method of fusing graphemes and morphemes, and establishes a text classification model that combines a hybrid self-attention …
