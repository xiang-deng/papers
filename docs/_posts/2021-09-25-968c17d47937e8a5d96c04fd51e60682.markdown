Feedback can help crowdworkers to improve their ideations. However, current feedback methods require human assessment from facilitators or peers. This is not scalable to large crowds. We propose Interpretable Directed Diversity to automatically predict ideation quality and diversity scores, and provide AI explanations-Attribution, Contrastive Attribution, and Counterfactual Suggestions-for deeper feedback on why ideations were scored (low), and how to get higher scores Cites: BERT: pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
