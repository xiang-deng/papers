Ad relevance modeling plays a critical role in online advertising systems including Microsoft Bing. To leverage powerful transformers like BERT in this low-latency setting, many existing approaches perform ad-side computations offline. While efficient, these approaches are unable to serve cold start ads, resulting in poor relevance predictions for such ads. This work aims to design a new, low-latency BERT via structured pruning to empower real-time online inference for cold start ads  Cites: Mobilebert: a compact task-agnostic bert for resource-limited devices
