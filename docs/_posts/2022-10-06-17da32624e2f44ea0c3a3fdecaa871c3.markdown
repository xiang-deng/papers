Community detection methods based on attribute network representation learning are receiving increasing attention. However, few existing works are focused exclusively on unsupervised network representation learning for the task of community detection. They mainly capture information about the topology or attributes of the network, but not fully utilize clustering-oriented information. In this paper, we present a community detection algorithm based on unsupervised …
