Large language models (LLMs) show impressive abilities via few-shot prompting. Commercialized APIs such as OpenAI GPT-3 further increase their use in real-world language applications. However, existing research focuses on models accuracy on standard benchmarks and largely ignores their reliability, which is crucial for avoiding catastrophic real-world harms. While reliability is a broad and vaguely defined term, this work decomposes reliability into four facets: generalizability  Cites: Can Explanations Be Useful for Calibrating Black Box Models?
