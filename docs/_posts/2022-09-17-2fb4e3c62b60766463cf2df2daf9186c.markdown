Abstract Neural Theorem Provers (NTPs) are neural relaxations of the backward-chaining logic reasoning algorithm. They can learn continuous representations for predicates and constants, induce interpretable rules, can provide logic explanations for their predictions, and show strong systematic generalisation properties. However, since they enumerate all possible proof paths for proving a goal, they suffer from high computational complexity, and are thus unsuitable for complex reasoning tasks  Cites: Learning reasoning strategies in end-to-end differentiable proving
