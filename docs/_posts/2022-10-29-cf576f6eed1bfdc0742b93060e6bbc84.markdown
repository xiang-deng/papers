We introduce a framework to discover interpretable regression models for high-stakes decision making in the context of safety-critical systems. The core of our proposal is a multi-objective hierarchical symbolic regression algorithm able to compute cluster-specific rankings of regression models ordered by increasing complexity. We discover the hierarchical structure by clustering the features  importances of a post-hoc explainability framework (viz., SHAP) applied to a highly …
