Unsupervised contrastive learning has recently become increasingly popular due to its amazing performance without the need for costly annotations. However, indiscriminate sampling of negative pairs is accompanied by the uniformity-tolerance dilemma, which is especially serious in node-level graph contrastive learning due to the smoothing property of graph convolutional operators. Previous negative mining strategies that either overly emphasize hard negatives or rely on precise distribution  Cites: Towards domain-agnostic contrastive learning
