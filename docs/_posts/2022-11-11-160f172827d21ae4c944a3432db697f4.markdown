Abstract Facial Expression Recognition (FER) suffers from misrecognition due to the similarities between expressions. To address this issue, popular works replace original annotations with soft labels to reflect expression similarities. However, existing soft label learning (SLL) modules are independent of FER modules. In this paper, inspired by automatic control theory, we propose a bias-based soft label learning network for FER named EC-Net.
