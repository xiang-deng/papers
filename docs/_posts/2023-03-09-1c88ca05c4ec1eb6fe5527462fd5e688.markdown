Energy demand continues to increase with no prospect of slowing down in the future. This increase is caused by several sociological and economical factors such as population growth, urbanization and technological developments. In view of this growth, it becomes crucial to predict energy consumption for a more accurate management and optimization. Nevertheless, consumption estimation is a complex task due to consumer behaviour fluctuation and weather alterations. Several efforts  Cites: Load forecasting using support vector machines: A study on
