In this work, we propose a new mathematical modelling of the spread of COVID-19 infection in an arbitrary population, by modifying the SIQRD model as m-SIQRD model, while taking into consideration the eight governmental interventions such as cancellation of events, closure of public places etc., as well as the influence of the asymptomatic cases on the states of the model. We introduce robustness and improved accuracy in predictions of these models by utilizing a novel deep learning Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
