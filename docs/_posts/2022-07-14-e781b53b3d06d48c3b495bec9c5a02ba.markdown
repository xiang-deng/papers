Accurate probabilistic predictions can be characterized by two properties {} calibration and sharpness. However, standard maximum likelihood training yields models that are poorly calibrated and thus inaccurate {} a 90% confidence interval typically does not contain the true outcome 90% of the time. This paper argues that calibration is important in practice and is easy to maintain by performing low-dimensional density estimation. We introduce a simple training procedure based on Cites: On-the-job learning with bayesian decision theory
