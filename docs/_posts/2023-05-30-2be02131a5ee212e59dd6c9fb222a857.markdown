Embedding-based retrieval has drawn massive attention in online search engines because of its semantic solid feature expression ability. Deep Siamese models leverage the powerful dense embeddings from strong language models like BERT to better represent sentences (queries and documents). However, deep Siamese models can suffer from a sub-optimal relevance prediction since they can hardly identify keywords due to late interaction between the query and document.
