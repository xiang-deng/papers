RDF verbalization has been received increasing interest, which aims to generate a natural language description of the knowledge base. Sequence-to-sequence models based on Transformer are able to obtain strong performance equipped with pre-trained language models such as BART and T5. However, in spite of the general performance gain introduced by the pre-trained models, the performance of the task is still limited by the small scale of the training dataset. To address the problem, we  Cites: A Thorough Examination of the CNN/Daily Mail Reading
