Accurate and timely detection of large events on urban transportation networks enables informed mobility management. This work tackles the problem of extreme event detection on large scale transportation networks using origin-destination mobility data, which is now widely available. Such data is highly structured in time and space, but high dimensional and sparse. Current multivariate time series anomaly detection methods cannot fully address these challenges. To exploit the … Cites: ‪Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications‬
