Opinion classification is used to classify and analyze the opinions in text-based product and service reviews. However, due to the uncertainty of opinion data, it is difficult to gain satisfactory classification accuracy using existing machine learning algorithms. Therefore, how to deal with uncertainty in opinions to improve the performance of machine learning is a challenge. This thesis develops a three-way decision-making framework to support two-stage decision making. It first divides Cites: User modeling with neural network for review rating prediction
