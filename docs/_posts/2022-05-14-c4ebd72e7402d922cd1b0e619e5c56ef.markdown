Biomedical studies often investigate the mechanisms behind how one entity (eg, a protein or a chemical) affects another in a biological context. The abstracts of these publications often include a focused set of sentences that present relevant supporting statements regarding such relationships, associated Cites: Text summarization with pretrained encoders
