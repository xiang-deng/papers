Human learning and generalization benefit from bootstrapping: we arrive at complex concepts by starting small and building upon past successes. In this paper, we examine a computational account of causal conceptual bootstrapping, and describe a novel experiment in which the sequence of training data results in a dramatic order effect: participants succeed in identifying a compound concept only after experiencing training data in a helpful order. Our computational model represents Cites: Learning programs: A hierarchical Bayesian approach
