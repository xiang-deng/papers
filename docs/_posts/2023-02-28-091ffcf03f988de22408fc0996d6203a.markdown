Objectives: To assess the performance bias caused by sampling data into training and test sets in a mammography radiomics study. Methods: Mammograms from 700 women were used to study upstaging of ductal carcinoma in situ. The dataset was repeatedly shuffled and split into training (n= 400) and test cases (n= 300) forty times. For each split, cross-validation was used for training, followed by an assessment of the test set. Logistic regression with regularization and support vector machine were  Cites: Evaluation of combined artificial intelligence and radiologist
