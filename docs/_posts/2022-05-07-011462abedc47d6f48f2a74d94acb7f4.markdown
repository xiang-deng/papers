Transition-based parsers for Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) rely on node- to-word alignments. These alignments are learned separately from parser training and require a complex pipeline of rule-based components, pre-processing, and post- processing to satisfy domain-specific constraints. Parsers also train on a point- estimate of the alignment pipeline, neglecting the uncertainty due to the inherent ambiguity of alignment. In this work we explore two avenues for overcoming these Cites: Compositional Generalization for Neural Semantic Parsing via
