Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a 6G enabler while promising to minimize power usage, bandwidth consumption, and transmission delay by minimizing irrelevant information transmission. However, the benefits of such a semantic-centric design can be limited by radio frequency interference (RFI) that causes substantial semantic noise. The impact of semantic noise due to interference can be alleviated using an interference-resistant and robust (IR $^ 2$) SemCom  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
