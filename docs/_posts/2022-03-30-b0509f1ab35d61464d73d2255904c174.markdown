Speech emotion recognition (SER) is traditionally performed using merely acoustic information. Acoustic features, commonly are extracted per frame, are mapped into emotion labels using classifiers such as support vector machines for machine learning or multi-layer perceptron for deep learning. Previous research has shown that acoustic-only SER suffers from many issues, mostly on low performances. On the other hand, not only acoustic information can be extracted from speech but also Cites: Glove: Global vectors for word representation
