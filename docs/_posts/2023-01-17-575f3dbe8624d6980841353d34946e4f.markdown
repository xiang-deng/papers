Hydrogen storage in absorbents as activated carbons has been rarely investigated; however, about 25 years ago, the development of new nanomaterials, initiated by Iijima s discovery of carbon microtubules, started new hopes. Unfortunately, initial results on high hydrogen uptake in carbon nanotubes at ambient conditions could not be independently reproduced; however, at cryogenic conditions, these novel nanomaterials just behaved as activated carbons with an uptake proportional to the Cites: Theoretical limits of hydrogen storage in metalorganic
