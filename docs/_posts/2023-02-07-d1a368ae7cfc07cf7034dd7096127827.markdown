Data redundancy has been one of the most important problems in data-intensive applications such as data mining and machine learning. Removing data redundancy brings many benefits in efficient data updating, effective data storage, and error-free query processing. While it has been studied for four decades, existing works on data redundancy mostly focus on syntactic formulations such as normal forms and functional dependencies, which lead to intractable discovery problems.
