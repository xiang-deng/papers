Building unified conversational agents has been a long-standing goal of the dialogue research community. Most previous works only focus on a subset of various dialogue tasks. In this work, we aim to build a unified foundation model which can solve massive diverse dialogue tasks. To achieve this goal, we first collect a large-scale well-labeled dialogue dataset from 73 publicly available datasets. In addition to this dataset, we further propose two dialogue-oriented self-supervised tasks, and Cites: Coqa: A conversational question answering challenge
