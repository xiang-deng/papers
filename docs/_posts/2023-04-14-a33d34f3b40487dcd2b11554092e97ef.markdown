Reliable and timely crop-yield prediction and crop mapping are crucial for food security and decision making in the food industry and in agro-environmental management. The global coverage, rich spectral and spatial information and repetitive nature of remote sensing (RS) data have made them effective tools for mapping crop extent and predicting yield before harvesting. Advanced machine-learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL), can accurately represent the  Cites: Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for
