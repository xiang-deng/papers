Deep neural networks, especially graph neural networks, have made great progress in aspect-based sentiment analysis. Knowledge graphs can provide rich auxiliary information for aspect-based sentiment analysis. However, existing models cannot effectively learn aspect-specific sentiment features from the review text and external knowledge. They cannot accurately select knowledge entities that are highly relevant to the aspect. They also ignore the semantic interaction between the review text and …
