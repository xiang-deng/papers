We examine the computational energy requirements of different systems driven by the geometrical scaling law, and increasing use of Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning (AI-ML) over the last decade. With more scientific and technology applications based on data-driven discovery, machine learning methods, especially deep neural networks, have become widely used. In order to enable such applications, both hardware accelerators and advanced AI-ML methods have led to  Cites: The carbon footprint of machine learning training will plateau, then
