Cyber-systems are under near-constant threat from intrusion attempts. Attacks types vary, but each attempt typically has a specific underlying intent, and the perpetrators are typically groups of individuals with similar objectives. Clustering attacks appearing to share a common intent is very valuable to threat-hunting experts. This article explores topic models for clustering terminal session commands collected from honeypots, which are special network hosts designed to entice malicious Cites: Online latent Dirichlet allocation with infinite vocabulary
