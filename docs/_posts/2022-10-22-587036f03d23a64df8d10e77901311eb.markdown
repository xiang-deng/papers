Recent self-supervised pre-training methods on Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) have shown promising competitiveness over traditional semi-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs). Unfortunately, their performance heavily depends on careful customization of various strategies for generating high-quality positive examples and negative examples, which notably limits their flexibility and generalization ability. In this work, we present SHGP, a …
