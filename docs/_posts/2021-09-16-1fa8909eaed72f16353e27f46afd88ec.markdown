We introduce a Recursive INsertion-based Encoder (RINE), a novel approach for semantic parsing in task-oriented dialog. Our model consists of an encoder network that incrementally builds the semantic parse tree by predicting the non-terminal label and its positions in the linearized tree. At the generation time, the model constructs the semantic parse tree by recursively inserting the predicted non-terminal labels at the predicted positions until termination. RINE achieves state-of-the-art exact match Cites: Task-oriented dialogue as dataflow synthesis
