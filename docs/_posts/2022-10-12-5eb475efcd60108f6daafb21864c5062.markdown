Abstract Land-use/land-cover (LULC) maps describe the Earth s surface with discrete classes at a specific spatial resolution. The chosen classes and resolution highly depend on peculiar uses, making it mandatory to develop methods to adapt these characteristics for a large range of applications. Recently, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method was introduced to take into account both spatial and geographical context to translate a LULC map into another one. However, this model …
