Keyphrases are crucial for searching and systematizing scholarly documents. Most current methods for keyphrase extraction are aimed at the extraction of the most significant words in the text. But in practice, the list of keyphrases often includes words that do not appear in the text explicitly. In this case, the list of keyphrases represents an abstractive summary of the source text. In this paper, we experiment with popular transformer-based models for abstractive text summarization using four Cites: Semeval 2017 task 10: Scienceie-extracting keyphrases and
