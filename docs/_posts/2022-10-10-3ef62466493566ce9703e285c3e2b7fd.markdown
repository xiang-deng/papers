Language features are ever-evolving in the real-world social media environment. Many trained models in natural language understanding (NLU), ineffective in semantic inference for unseen features, might consequently struggle with the deteriorating performance in dynamicity. To address this challenge, we empirically study social media NLU in a dynamic setup, where models are trained on the past data and test on the future. It better reflects the realistic practice compared to the  Cites: Evaluating Factuality in Generation with Dependency-level
