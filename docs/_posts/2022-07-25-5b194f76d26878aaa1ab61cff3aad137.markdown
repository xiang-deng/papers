Eventuality-centric knowledge graphs are essential resources for many downstream applications. However, current knowledge graphs mainly focus on knowledge about entities while ignoring the real-world eventualities (including events and states).

We argue that rule-based methods are of great value for knowledge graph construction, but must be used in conjunction with other Cites: (Comet-) atomic 2020: on symbolic and neural commonsense
