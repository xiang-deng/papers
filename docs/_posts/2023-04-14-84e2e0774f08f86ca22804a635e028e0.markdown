Noisy labels, inevitably existing in pseudo-segmentation labels generated from weak object-level annotations, severely hamper model optimization for semantic segmentation. Previous works often rely on massive handcrafted losses and carefully tuned hyperparameters to resist noise, suffering poor generalization capability and high model complexity. Inspired by recent advances in meta-learning, we argue that rather than struggling to tolerate noise hidden behind clean labels passively, a more Cites: Generalized inner loop meta-learning
