Existing automated machine learning solutions and intelligent discovery assistants are popular tools that facilitate the end-user with the design of data science (DS) pipelines. However, they yield limited applicability for a wide range of real-world use cases and application domains due to (a) the limited support of DS tasks;(b) a small, static set of available operators; and (c) restriction to evaluation processes with quantifiable loss functions. We demonstrate DORIAN, a human-in-the-loop approach  Cites: AlphaD3M: Machine learning pipeline synthesis
