In real life, there are many cases that cannot be described by the network abstracted as the graph, but can be described perfectly by the hypernetwork abstracted as the hypergraph. Different from the network, the hypernetwork structure is more complex and poses a great challenge to the existing network representation learning methods. Therefore, in order to overcome the challenge of the hypernetwork structure, a hypernetwork representation learning method with the transformation Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
