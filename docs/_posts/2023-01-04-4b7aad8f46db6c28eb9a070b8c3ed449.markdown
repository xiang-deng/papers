The selection of the best single blastocyst for transfer is typically based on the assessment of the morphological characteristics of the zona pellucida (ZP), trophectoderm (TE), blastocoel (BC), and inner cell-mass (ICM), using subjective and observer-dependent grading protocols. We propose the first automatic method for segmenting all morphological structures during the different developmental stages of the blastocyst (ie, expansion, hatching, and hatched). Our database contains 592 …
