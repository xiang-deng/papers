Relation extraction (RE) has recently moved from the sentence-level to document-level, which requires aggregating document information and using entities and mentions for reasoning. Existing works put entity nodes and mention nodes with similar representations in a document-level graph, whose complex edges may incur redundant information. Furthermore, existing studies only focus on entity-level reasoning paths without considering global interactions among entities cross  Cites: Coreferential reasoning learning for language representation
