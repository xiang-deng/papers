Mathematical reasoning recently has been shown as a hard challenge for neural systems. Abilities including expression translation, logical reasoning, and mathematics knowledge acquiring appear to be essential to overcome the challenge. This paper demonstrates that some abilities can be achieved through abductive combination with discrete systems that have been programmed with human knowledge. On a mathematical reasoning dataset, we adopt the recently proposed Cites: MathQA: Towards interpretable math word problem solving with
