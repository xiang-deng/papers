Priming is challenging when consumers start shortlisting products before the final purchase. This is because this shortlisting process is performed in multiple user sessions online across time, the shortlist does not stay as a static list, and product comparison in this stage uses the heuristics internal to individual consumers. The goal of this study is two folds:(1) to approximate user heuristics after B&B product shortlisting using NLP and deep learning techniques, and (2) to identify optimized Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
