We introduce Logical Credal Networks (or LCNs for short)--an expressive probabilistic logic that generalizes prior formalisms that combine logic and probability. Given imprecise information represented by probability bounds and conditional probability bounds on logic formulas, an LCN specifies a set of probability distributions over all its interpretations. Our approach allows propositional and first-order logic formulas with few restrictions, eg, without requiring acyclicity. We  Cites: Introduction to statistical relational learning
