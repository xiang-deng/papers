As software systems become increasingly heterogeneous, the ability of compilers to reason about an entire system has decreased. When components of a system are not implemented as traditional programs, but rather as specialised hardware, optimised architecture-specific libraries, or network services, the compiler is unable to cross these abstraction barriers and analyse the system as a whole. If these components could be modelled or understood as programs, then the compiler would Cites: Optimal Neural Program Synthesis from Multimodal Specifications
