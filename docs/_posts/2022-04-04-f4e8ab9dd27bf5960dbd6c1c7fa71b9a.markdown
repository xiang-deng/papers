This dissertation considers three problems lying at the intersection of optimization and machine learning. In Chapter 2, we consider the problem of designing risk- aware algorithms for the optimal power flow problems. In Chapter 3, we consider the problem of designing PCA algorithms when the data is generated from a dynamic environment. In Chapter 4 and 5, we consider the problem of designing algorithms for the contextual bandit problem in presence of covariate shift.
