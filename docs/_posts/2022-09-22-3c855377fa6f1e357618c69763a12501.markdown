An intelligent manufacturing paradigm requires material systems, manufacturing systems, and design engineering to be better connected. Surrogate models are used to couple product-design choices with manufacturing process variables and material systems, hence, to connect and capture knowledge and embed intelligence in the system. Later, optimisation-driven design provides the ability to enhance the human cognitive abilities in decision-making in complex systems.
