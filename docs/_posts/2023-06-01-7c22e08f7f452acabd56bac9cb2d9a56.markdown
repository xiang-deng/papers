Data augmentation (DA) is a crucial technique for enhancing the sample efficiency of visual reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Notably, employing simple observation transformations alone can yield outstanding performance without extra auxiliary representation tasks or pre-trained encoders. However, it remains unclear which attributes of DA account for its effectiveness in achieving sample-efficient visual RL. To investigate this issue and further explore the potential of DA, this work …
