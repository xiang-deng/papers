Given a heterogeneous information network (HIN) H, a head node h, a meta-path P, and a tail node t, the meta-path prediction aims at predicting whether h can be linked to t by an instance of P. Most existing solutions either require predefined meta-paths, which limits their scalability to schema-rich HINs and long meta-paths, or do not aim at predicting the existence of an instance of P. To address these issues, in this article, we propose a novel prediction model, called ABLE, by exploiting the A ttention Cites: Quac: Question answering in context
