With the development of science and technology, image processing gradually develops towards higher dimensions. High-dimensional data is usually regarded as approximated by the union of multiple low-dimensional data. That is, the high- dimensional subspace is divided into several low-dimensional subspaces, so as to provide better insights for understanding the underlying structure of the high- dimensional subspace. Most of the existing clustering methods solve the problem of Cites: Introduction to information retrieval
