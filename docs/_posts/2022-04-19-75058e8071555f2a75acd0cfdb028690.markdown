Blockchain has widely been adopted to design accountable federated learning frameworks; however, the existing frameworks do not scale for distributed model training over multiple independent blockchain networks. For storing the pre-trained models over blockchain, current approaches primarily embed a model using its structural properties that are neither scalable for cross-chain exchange nor suitable for cross-chain verification. This paper proposes an architectural framework for cross Cites: Learning by abstraction: The neural state machine
