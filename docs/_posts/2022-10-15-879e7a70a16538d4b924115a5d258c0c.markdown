Due to the complexity of logic, logical connections exist at different granularity levels. However, most existing methods of logical reasoning individually focus on either entity-aware or discourse-based information but ignore the hierarchical relations that may even have mutual Cites: Neural symbolic reader: Scalable integration of distributed and
