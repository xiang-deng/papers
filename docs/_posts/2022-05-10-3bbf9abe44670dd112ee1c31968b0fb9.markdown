A Cu complex featuring a hexadentate ligand was synthesized and evaluated as a redox shuttle in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) devices, which exhibited excellent performance under low-light conditions. Cu-based redox shuttles (RSs) have been shown to perform remarkably well under low-light conditions; however, most of the known Cu-based RSs employ bidentate pyridyl ligands and often require bulky flanking groups adjacent to the nitrogen donors of these ligands to prevent distortion Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
