The escalating debate on AI s capabilities warrants developing reliable metrics to assess machine intelligence . Recently, many anecdotal examples were used to suggest that newer large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 exhibit Neural Theory-of-Mind (N-ToM); however, prior work reached conflicting conclusions regarding those abilities. We investigate the extent of LLMs N-ToM through an extensive evaluation on 6 tasks and find that while LLMs exhibit certain N-ToM Cites: Beyond the Imitation Game: Quantifying and extrapolating the
