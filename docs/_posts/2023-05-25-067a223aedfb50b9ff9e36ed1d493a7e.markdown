To ensure the fairness of machine learning systems, we can include a fairness loss during training based on demographic information associated with the training data. However, we cannot train debiased classifiers for most tasks since the relevant datasets lack demographic annotations. Can we utilize demographic data for a related task to improve the fairness of our target task? We demonstrate that demographic fairness objectives transfer to new tasks trained within a multi-task  Cites: When to Use Multi-Task Learning vs Intermediate Fine-Tuning for
