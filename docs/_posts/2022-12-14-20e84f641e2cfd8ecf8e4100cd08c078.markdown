Recent pre-trained language models have shown promising capabilities in generating fluent and realistic natural language text. However, generating multi-sentence text with global content planning has been a long-existing research question. Current approaches for controlled text generation can hardly address this issue, as they usually condition on single known control attributes. In this study, we propose a low-cost yet effective framework which explicitly models the global content Cites: Flexible generation of natural language deductions
