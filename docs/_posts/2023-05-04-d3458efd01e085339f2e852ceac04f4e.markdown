Neural code intelligence models continue to be black boxes  to the human programmer. This opacity limits their application towards code intelligence tasks, particularly for applications like vulnerability detection where a model s reliance on spurious correlations can be safety-critical. We introduce a neuron-level approach to interpretability of neural code intelligence models which eliminates redundancy due to highly similar or task-irrelevant neurons within these networks. We evaluate the …
