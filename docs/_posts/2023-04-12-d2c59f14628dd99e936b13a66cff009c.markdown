Automated machine learning (AutoML) methods improve upon existing models by optimizing various aspects of their design. While present methods focus on hyperparameters and neural network topologies, other aspects of neural network design can be optimized as well. To further the state of the art in AutoML, this dissertation introduces techniques for discovering more powerful activation functions and establishing more robust weight initialization for neural networks. These …
