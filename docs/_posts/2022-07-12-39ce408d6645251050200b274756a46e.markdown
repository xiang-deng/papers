ABSTRACT Social recommendation with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) learns to represent cold users by fusing user-user social relations with user-item interactions, thereby alleviating the cold-start problem associated with recommender systems. Despite being well adapted to social relations and user-item interactions, these supervised models are still susceptible to popularity bias. Contrastive learning helps resolve this dilemma by identifying the properties that distinguish positive from  Cites: Recommender systems with social regularization
