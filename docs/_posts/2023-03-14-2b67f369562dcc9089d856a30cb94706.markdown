Although deep neural models substantially reduce the overhead of feature engineering, the features readily available in the inputs might significantly impact training cost and the performance of the models. In this paper, we explore the impact of an unsuperivsed feature enrichment approach based on variable roles on the performance of neural models of code. The notion of variable roles (as introduced in the works of Sajaniemi et al.[Refs. 1, 2]) has been found to help students  abilities in …
