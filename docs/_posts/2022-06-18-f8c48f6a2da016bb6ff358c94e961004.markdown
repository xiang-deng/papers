Although machine learning on hypergraphs has attracted considerable attention, most of the works have focused on (semi-) supervised learning, which may cause heavy labeling costs and poor generalization. Recently, contrastive learning has emerged as a successful unsupervised representation learning method. Despite the prosperous development of contrastive learning in other domains, contrastive learning on hypergraphs remains little explored. In this paper, we propose TriCon  Cites: SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings
