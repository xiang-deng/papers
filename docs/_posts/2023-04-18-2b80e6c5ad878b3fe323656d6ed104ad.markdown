The public data on the Internet contains a large amount of high-value open source intelligence (OSINT) for the national defense. As the fundamental information extraction task, Named Entity Recognition (NER) plays a key role in question answering systems, knowledge graphs and reasoning. However, NER for the national defense domain achieves little progress due to unavailable datasets. Most previous methods mainly work on general-purpose datasets which lack insight into Cites: Neural segmental hypergraphs for overlapping mention recognition
