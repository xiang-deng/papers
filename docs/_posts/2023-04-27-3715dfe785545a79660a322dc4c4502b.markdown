Relation Classification (RC) is a basic and essential task of Natural Language Processing. Existing RC methods can be classified into two categories: sequence-based methods and dependency-based methods. Sequence-based methods identify the target relation based on the overall semantics of the whole sentence, which will inevitably introduce noisy features. Dependency-based methods extract indicative word-level features from the Shortest Dependency Path (SDP) between given …
