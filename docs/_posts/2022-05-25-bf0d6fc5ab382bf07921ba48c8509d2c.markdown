In this paper, we present a novel method to compute decision rules to build a more accurate interpretable machine learning model, denoted as ExMo. The ExMo interpretable machine learning model consists of a list of IF... THEN... statements with a decision rule in the condition. This way, ExMo naturally provides an explanation for a prediction using the decision rule that was triggered. ExMo uses a new approach to extract decision rules from the training data using term frequency-inverse document Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
