The broad application prospects of knowledge graphs have spawned many research work in the field of knowledge graph completion. In these works, models based on convolution neural networks perform well on link prediction tasks by generating expressive feature embedding. Some models based on graph neural networks also obtain good knowledge graph embedding results by capturing graph structure features and node features in the knowledge graph. However, these models often …
