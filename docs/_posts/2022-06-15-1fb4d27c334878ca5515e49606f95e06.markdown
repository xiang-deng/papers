Manufacturing of fiber reinforced polymer matrix composite materials is being done with various methods in recent days. But controlling the accuracy of manufacturing and begetting quality products is very challenging. Adopting single manufacturing techniques may not cater this purpose, but blended or unified technologies do. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technique that is highly reliable to be blended with current methods and caters to the needs of various composite Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
