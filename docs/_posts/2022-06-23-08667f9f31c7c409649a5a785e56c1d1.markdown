Fast and accurate semantic analysis of natural disaster images is crucial for rational rescue plans and resource allocation. However, the scarcity of meticulously labelled datasets and the ignorance of region-of-interest scale variations of popular general-purpose methods lead to undesirable performance. In this paper, we propose a novel triple-strip attention mechanism (TSAM) to solve the generalization problem of disaster images that can be combined into general networks. Our TSAM accumulates  Cites: Coatnet: Marrying convolution and attention for all data sizes
