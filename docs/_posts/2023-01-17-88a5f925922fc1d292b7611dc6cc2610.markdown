The target of event detection (ED) is to recognize and categorize event triggers in a given text. Because dependency trees transmit extensive structural information that has been proven effective, most contemporary ED approaches rely primarily on syntactic information. The majority of these methods, however, are ineffective due to two issues: a) how to mine and use both first-order and multi-order syntactic relations, and b) loss of information due to external dependency analysis toolbox.
