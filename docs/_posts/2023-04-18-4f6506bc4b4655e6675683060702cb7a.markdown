This paper presents a systematic investigation into the effectiveness of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for Electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmia detection. We begin by conducting a novel distribution analysis on three popular ECG-based arrhythmia datasets: PTB-XL, Chapman, and Ribeiro. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to quantify these distributions in this area. We then perform a comprehensive set of experiments using different augmentations and Cites: A framework for contrastive self-supervised learning and designing
