Neural information retrieval often adopts a retrieve-and-rerank framework: a bi-encoder network first retrieves K (eg, 100) candidates that are then re-ranked using a more powerful cross-encoder model to rank the better candidates higher. The re-ranker generally produces better candidate scores than the retriever, but is limited to seeing only the top K retrieved candidates, thus providing no improvements in retrieval performance as measured by Recall@ K. In this work, we leverage the re  Cites: Open-domain Question Answering
