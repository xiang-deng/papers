Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has recently gained a swell of interest, as many Artificial Intelligence (AI) practitioners and developers are compelled to rationalize how such AI-based systems work. Decades back, most XAI systems were developed as knowledge-based or expert systems. These systems assumed reasoning for the technical description of an explanation, with little regard for the user s cognitive capabilities. The emphasis of XAI research appears to have turned to …
