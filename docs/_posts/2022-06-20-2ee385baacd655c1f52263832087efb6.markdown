While the conventional software components implement pre-defined specifications, Machine Learning (ML)-enabled Software Components (MLSC) learn the domain specifications from the training samples. Thus, the MLSC s data-driven and inductive reasoning becomes highly reliant on the quality of the training dataset, which are often arbitrarily collected in ad hoc manners. The random collection of samples leads to a significant gap between the actual specifications of a real-world concept, and the
