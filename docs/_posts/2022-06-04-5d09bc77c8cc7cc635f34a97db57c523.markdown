Abstract A Secondary Study (SS) is an important research method used in several areas. A crucial step in the Conduction phase of a SS is the search of studies. This step is time-consuming and error-prone, mainly due to the refinement of the search string. The objective of this study is to validate the effectiveness of an automatic formulation of search strings for SS. Our approach, termed Search String Generator (SeSG), takes as input a small set of studies (as a Quasi-Gold Standard) and  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
