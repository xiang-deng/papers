Scientific fact-checking is crucial for ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and trustworthiness of scientific claims. However, existing benchmarks are limited in terms of their claim diversity, reliance on text-based evidence, and oversimplification of scientific reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce SCITAB, a novel dataset comprising 1,225 challenging scientific claims requiring compositional reasoning with scientific tables. The claims in SCITAB are derived from the actual scientific …
