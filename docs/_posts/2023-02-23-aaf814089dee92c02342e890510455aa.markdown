Fine-grained information on translation errors is helpful for the translation evaluation community. Existing approaches can not synchronously consider error position and type, failing to integrate the error information of both. In this paper, we propose Fine-Grained Translation Error Detection (FG-TED) task, aiming at identifying both the position and the type of translation errors on given source-hypothesis sentence pairs. Besides, we build an FG-TED model to predict the\textbf {addition} and\textbf Cites: Detecting Hallucinated Content in Conditional Neural Sequence
