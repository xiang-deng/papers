The automatic early diagnosis of prodromal stages of Alzheimer s disease is of great relevance for patient treatment to improve quality of life. We address this problem as a multi-modal classification task. Multi-modal data provides richer and complementary information. However, existing techniques only consider either lower order relations between the data and single/multi-modal imaging data. In this work, we introduce a novel semi-supervised hypergraph learning framework for Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
