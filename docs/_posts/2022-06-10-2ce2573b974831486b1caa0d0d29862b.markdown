Current state-of-the-art document retrieval solutions mainly follow an index-retrieve paradigm, where the index is hard to be optimized for the final retrieval target. In this paper, we aim to show that an end-to-end deep neural network unifying training and indexing stages can significantly improve the recall performance of traditional methods. To this end, we propose Neural Corpus Indexer (NCI), a sequence-to-sequence network that generates relevant document identifiers directly for a Cites: Autoregressive Search Engines: Generating Substrings as
