An insightful understanding and relational reasoning of motion behavior are typical components for trajectory prediction to achieve safe planning when navigating in complex scenarios. Due to the differences in behavioral responses of heterogeneous agents and the existence of chain effect in message passing, an effective prediction method is desired to better acquire potential behavioral intention and model motion behavior. In this paper, we construct a trajectory prediction method to represent and  Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
