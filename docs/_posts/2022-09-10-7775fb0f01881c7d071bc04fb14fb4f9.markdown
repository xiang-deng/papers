In our pursuit of generic criteria for decidable ontology-based querying, we introduce finite-cliquewidth sets (FCS) of existential rules, a model-theoretically defined class of rule sets, inspired by the cliquewidth measure from graph theory. By a generic argument, we show that FCS ensures decidability of entailment for a sizable class of queries (dubbed DaMSOQs ) subsuming conjunctive queries (CQs). The FCS class properly generalizes the class of finite-expansion sets (FES), and for Cites: Query containment for conjunctive queries with regular expressions
