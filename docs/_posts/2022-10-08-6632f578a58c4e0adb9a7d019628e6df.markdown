Non-functional bugs (eg, performance-or accuracy-related bugs) in Deep Learning (DL) frameworks can lead to some of the most devastating consequences. Reporting those bugs on a repository such as GitHub is a standard route to fix them. Yet, given the growing number of new GitHub reports for DL frameworks, it is intrinsically difficult for developers to distinguish those that reveal non-functional bugs among the others, and assign them to the right contributor for investigation in a timely manner.
