Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm that enables clients to jointly train a global model. In real-world FL implementations, client data could have label noise, and different clients could have vastly different label noise levels. Although there exist methods in centralized learning for tackling label noise, such methods do not perform well on heterogeneous label noise in FL settings, due to the typically smaller sizes of client datasets and data privacy Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
