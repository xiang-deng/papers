While parameter efficient tuning (PET) methods have shown great potential with transformer architecture on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness is still under-studied with large-scale ConvNets on Computer Vision (CV) tasks. This paper proposes Conv-Adapter, a PET module designed for ConvNets. Conv-Adapter is light-weight, domain-transferable, and architecture-agnostic with generalized performance on different tasks.
