Negation is a common linguistic feature that is crucial in many language understanding tasks, yet it remains a hard problem due to diversity in its expression in different types of text. Recent work has shown that state-of-the-art NLP models underperform on samples containing negation in various tasks, and that negation detection models do not transfer well across domains. We propose a new negation- focused pre-training strategy, involving targeted data augmentation and negation Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
