The growing demand for having a conversation amongst people who come from different areas, across the globe, resulting from globalization, has led to the development of systems like machine translations. There are techniques like statistical models, Bayesian models, etc. that were used earlier for machine translations. However, with growing expectations towards better accuracies, neural networks aided systems for translations termed as neural machine translations  Cites: Unsupervised neural machine translation
