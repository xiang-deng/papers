As a prevalent problem in online advertising, CTR prediction has attracted plentiful attention from both academia and industry. Recent studies have been reported to establish CTR prediction models in the graph neural networks (GNNs) framework. However, most of GNNs-based models handle feature interactions in a complete graph, while ignoring causal relationships among features, which results in a huge drop in the performance on out-of-distribution data. This paper is dedicated to …
