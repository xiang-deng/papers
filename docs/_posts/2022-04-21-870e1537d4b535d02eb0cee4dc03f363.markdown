Blockchain technology has been used in various fields including digital currencies, distributed storage, and more. The issue of SATD detection for open source blockchain software systems has not been studied. We provide an in-depth analysis of the code comments of open blockchain source software projects. A pre-trained model based on cost-sensitivity is proposed, which is compared with the baseline model on several evaluation metrics. The results were statistically analyzed.
