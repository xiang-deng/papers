In mammography, calcifications are one of the most common signs of breast cancer. Detection of such lesions is an active area of research for computer-aided diagnosis and machine learning algorithms. Due to limited numbers of positive cases, many supervised detection models suffer from overfitting and fail to generalize. We present a one-class, semi-supervised framework using a deep convolutional autoencoder trained with over 50,000 images from 11,000 negative-only cases.
