One of the most challenging problems in the question answering (QA) area is the lack of high-quality labeled data. However, the cost of manually labeling a question-answer (QA) pair from the target text is very high. One way to solve this problem is to automatically generate QA pairs from the target text. In this paper, we propose the Batch Normalization conditional VAE-QA pair generation (BNCVAE-QAG) model to generate QA pairs for a given text. First, we employ the Batch Normalization (BN) … Cites: ‪Addressing Semantic Drift in Question Generation for Semi …‬
