Probabilistic topic models have become one of the most widespread machine learning techniques in textual analysis. Topic discovering is an unsupervised process that does not guarantee the interpretability of its output. Hence, the automatic evaluation of topic coherence has attracted the interest of many researchers over the last decade, and it is an open research area. This article offers a new quality evaluation method based on statistically validated networks (SVNs) Cites: Applications of topic models
