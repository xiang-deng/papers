Many practical uses of transpilers require the user to be able to guide or customize the program produced from a given input program. This customizability is important for satisfying many application-specific goals for the produced code such as ensuring performance, readability, maintainability, compatibility, and so on. Conventional transpilers are deterministic rule-driven systems often written without offering Cites: Automated Transpilation of Imperative to Functional Code using
