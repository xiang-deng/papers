Automatic knowledge graph construction, using supervised relation extraction from text, has become the state-of-the-art to create large-scale repositories of background knowledge for various applications. Recent advances in machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), in particular the advent of the large language models, have improved the performance of relation extraction systems significantly. Traditional leaderboard style benchmark settings show very high performance Cites: Manual Evaluation Matters: Reviewing Test Protocols of Distantly
