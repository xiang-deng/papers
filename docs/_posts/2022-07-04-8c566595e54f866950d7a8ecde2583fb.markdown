Causal Machine Learning (CausalML) is an umbrella term for machine learning methods that formalize the data-generation process as a structural causal model (SCM). This allows one to reason about the effects of changes to this process (ie, interventions) and what would have happened in hindsight (ie, counterfactuals). We categorize work in\causalml into five groups according to the problems they tackle:(1) causal supervised learning,(2) causal generative modeling,(3) causal Cites: Wilds: A benchmark of in-the-wild distribution shifts
