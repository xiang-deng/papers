We propose a label enhancement model to solve the multi-label learning (MLL) problem by using the incremental subspace learning to enrich the label space and to improve the ability of label recognition. In particular, we use the incremental estimation of the feature function representing the manifold structure to guide the construction of the label space and to transform the local topology from the feature space to the label space. First, we build a recursive form for incremental estimation of  Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
