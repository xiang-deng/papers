Applied mathematics and machine computations have raised a lot of hope since the recent success of supervised learning. Many practitioners in industries have been trying to switch from their old paradigms to machine learning. Interestingly, those data scientists spend more time scrapping, annotating and cleaning data than fine-tuning models. This thesis is motivated by the following question: can we derive a more generic framework than the one of supervised learning in order to learn from …
