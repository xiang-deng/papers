Pseudo Labeling is a technique used to improve the performance of semi-supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by generating additional pseudo-labels based on confident predictions. However, the quality of generated pseudo-labels has long been a concern due to the sensitivity of the classification objective to given labels. To avoid the untrustworthy classification supervision indicating``a node belongs to a specific class, we favor the fault-tolerant contrasting supervision demonstrating``two  Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
