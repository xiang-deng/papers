Relation Extraction (RE) is to obtain a predefined relation type of two entities mentioned in a piece of text, eg, a sentence-level or a document-level text. Most existing studies suffer from the noise in the text, and necessary pruning is of great importance. The conventional sentence-level RE task addresses this issue by a denoising method using the shortest dependency path to build a long-range semantic dependency between entity pairs. However, this kind of denoising method …
