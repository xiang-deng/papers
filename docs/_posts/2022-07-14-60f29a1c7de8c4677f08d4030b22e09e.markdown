Community detection in attributed graph is of great application value and many related methods have been continually presented. However, existing methods for community detection in attributed graph still cannot well solve three key problems simultaneously: link information and attribute information fusion, prior information integration and overlapping community detection. Aiming at these problems, in this paper we devise a semi-supervised overlapping community detection method  Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
