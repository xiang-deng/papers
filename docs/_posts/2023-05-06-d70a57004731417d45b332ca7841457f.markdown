Contrastive learning has become a popular approach in natural language processing, particularly for the learning of sentence embeddings. However, the discrete nature of natural language makes it difficult to ensure the quality of positive and negative sample pairs generated through data augmentation methods. Although supervised contrastive learning can produce more accurate sample pairs with human feedback labels, it still lacks fine-grained training signals.
