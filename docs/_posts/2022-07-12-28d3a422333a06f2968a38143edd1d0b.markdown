Event detection (ED) is a pivotal task for information retrieval, which aims at identifying event triggers and classifying them into pre-defined event types. In real-world applications, events are usually annotated with numerous fine-grained types, which often arises long-tail type nature and co-occurrence event nature. Existing studies explore the event correlations without full utilization, which may limit the capability of event detection. This paper simultaneously incorporates both the type Cites: A language-independent neural network for event detection
