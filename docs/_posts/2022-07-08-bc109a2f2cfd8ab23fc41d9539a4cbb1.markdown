Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can automatically design architectures for deep neural networks (DNNs) and has become one of the hottest research topics in the current machine learning community. However, NAS is often computationally expensive because a large number of DNNs require to be trained for obtaining performance during the search process. Performance predictors can greatly alleviate the prohibitive cost of NAS by directly predicting the performance of DNNs. However  Cites: Generative data augmentation for commonsense reasoning
