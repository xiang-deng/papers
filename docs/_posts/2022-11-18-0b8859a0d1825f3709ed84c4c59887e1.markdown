Graph contrastive learning (GCL), aiming to generate supervision information by transforming the graph data itself, is increasingly becoming a focus of graph research. It has shown promising performance in graph representation learning by extracting global-level abstract features of graphs. Nonetheless, most GCL methods are performed in a completely unsupervised manner and would get unappealing results in balancing the multi-view information of graphs. To alleviate this, we  Cites: SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings
