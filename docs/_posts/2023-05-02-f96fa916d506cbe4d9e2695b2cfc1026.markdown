This work empirically investigates punctuation insertions as adversarial attacks on NLP systems. Data from experiments on three tasks, five datasets, and six models with four attacks show that punctuation insertions, when limited to a few symbols (apostrophes and hyphens), are a superior attack vector compared to character insertions due to 1) a lower after-attack accuracy ($ A_ {aft-atk} $) than alphabetical character insertions; 2) higher semantic similarity between the resulting and original  Cites: It s Morphin time!
