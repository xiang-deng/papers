Patents are a valuable source of knowledge, but drafting them is a time-consuming and expensive task. Methods that assist patent generation can provide a two-fold improvement as they can speed up the generation process and suggest to the inventor ideas and claims. Herein, influenced by recent advances in language modeling via multitask learning and prompt engineering, we present Patent Generative Transformer (PGT), a transformer-based language model trained to …
