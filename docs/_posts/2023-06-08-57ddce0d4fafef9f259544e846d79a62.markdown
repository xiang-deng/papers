Information explosion has brought us a wide range of data formats and machine learning keeps in constant evolution to develop mechanisms to extract knowledge from them. Modern models in the Deep Learning space have proven to be very successful in multiple applications, yet in the tabular space they fail to provide consistent competitive performance. However, in this work we claim model selection can become irrelevant as the key tends to lie in data processing. In this paper we  Cites: Input selection for fast feature engineering
