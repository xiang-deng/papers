We target the problem of synthesizing proofs of semantic equivalence between two programs made of sequences of statements with complex symbolic expressions. We propose a neural network architecture based on the transformer to generate axiomatic proofs of equivalence between program pairs. We generate expressions which include scalars and vectors and support multi-typed rewrite rules to prove equivalence. For training the system, we develop an original training technique Cites: DIRE: A neural approach to decompiled identifier naming
