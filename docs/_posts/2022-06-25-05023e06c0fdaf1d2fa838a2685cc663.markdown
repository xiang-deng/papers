We study the dynamic evaluation of conjunctive queries with output access patterns. An access pattern is a partition of the free variables of the query into input and output. The query returns tuples over the output variables given a tuple over the input variables. Our contribution is threefold. First, we give a syntactic characterisation of queries that admit constant time per single-tuple update and whose output tuples can be enumerated with constant delay given an input tuple. Second, we define a class Cites: Query optimization in the presence of limited access patterns
