We propose a simple yet effective strategy to incorporate event knowledge extracted from event trigger annotations via posterior regularization to improve the event reasoning capability of mainstream question-answering (QA) models for event-centric QA. In particular, we define event-related knowledge constraints based on the event trigger annotations in the QA datasets, and subsequently use them to regularize the posterior answer output probabilities from the backbone pre-trained  Cites: ESTER: A Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset for Event
