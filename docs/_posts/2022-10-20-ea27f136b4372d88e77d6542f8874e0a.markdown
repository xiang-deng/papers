In the last few years, electron microscopy has experienced a new methodological paradigm aimed to fix the bottlenecks and overcome the challenges of its analytical workflow. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are answering this call providing powerful resources towards automation, exploration, and development. In this review, we evaluate the state-of-the-art of machine learning applied to electron microscopy (and obliquely, to materials and nano-sciences). We start from the  Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
