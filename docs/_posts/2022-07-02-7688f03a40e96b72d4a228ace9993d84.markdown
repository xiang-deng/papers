Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) methods have quickly made the transition from translation-based approaches to semantic-based approaches. In this paper, we examine the limitations of current unsupervised neural CLIR methods, especially those leveraging aligned cross-lingual word embedding (CLWE) spaces. At the moment, CLWEs are normally constructed on the monolingual corpus of bilingual texts through an iterative induction process. Homonymy and polysemy have become …
