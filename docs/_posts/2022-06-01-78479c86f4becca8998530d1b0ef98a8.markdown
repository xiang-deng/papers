User-generated content is a fundamental source of information to aid the decision-making in several tasks, such as online marketing and follow-up intent response. Nonetheless, they also present several challenges, as the utterance sentences are short, noisy, lack proper grammar, and relate to multiple classes. Classification from texts has been widely addressed in the last years by extracting features from pretrained language models. However, because of the noisy nature of utterance … Cites: ‪Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language …‬
