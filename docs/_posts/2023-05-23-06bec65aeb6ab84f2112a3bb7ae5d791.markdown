Code generation aims to automatically generate source code from high-level task specifications, which can significantly increase productivity of software engineering. Recently, approaches based on large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable code generation abilities on simple tasks. However, generate code for more complex tasks, such as competition-level problems, remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Brainstorm framework for code generation. It leverages a  Cites: Incoder: A generative model for code infilling and synthesis
