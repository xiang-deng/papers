Graph neural networks (GNNs) realize great success in graph learning but suffer from performance loss when meeting heterophily, ie neighboring nodes are dissimilar, due to their local and uniform aggregation. Existing attempts in incoorporating global aggregation for heterophilous GNNs usually require iteratively maintaining and updating full-graph information, which entails $\mathcal {O}(n^ 2) $ computation efficiency for a graph with $ n $ nodes, leading to weak scalability to  Cites: SCARA: scalable graph neural networks with feature-oriented
