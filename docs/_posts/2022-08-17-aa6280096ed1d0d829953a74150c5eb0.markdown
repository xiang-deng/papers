Building conversational AI systems has the goal to teach machines to understand human language and respond naturally. The most common way to train agents to produce and interpret natural language is currently by exposing them to large quantities of data. Although this has resulted in advances in many areas, these systems typically have little understanding of how language is related to the real world (Mordatch and Abbeel, 2018), known as the grounding problem.
