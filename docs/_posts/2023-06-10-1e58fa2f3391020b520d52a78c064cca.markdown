Recently, compressive text summarisation offers a balance between the conciseness issue of extractive summarisation and the factual hallucination issue of abstractive summarisation. However, most existing compressive summarisation methods are supervised, relying on the expensive effort of creating a new training dataset with corresponding compressive summaries. In this paper, we propose an efficient and interpretable compressive summarisation method that utilises unsupervised dual  Cites: BRIO: Bringing Order to Abstractive Summarization
