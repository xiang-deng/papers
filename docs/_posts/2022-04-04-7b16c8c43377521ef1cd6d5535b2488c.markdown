In this research, we propose a tiny image segmentation model, L^ 3U-net, that works on low-resource edge devices in real-time. We introduce a data folding technique that reduces inference latency by leveraging the parallel convolutional layer processing capability of the CNN accelerators. We also deploy the proposed model to such a device, MAX78000, and the results show that L^ 3U-net achieves more than 90% accuracy over two different segmentation datasets with 10 fps.
