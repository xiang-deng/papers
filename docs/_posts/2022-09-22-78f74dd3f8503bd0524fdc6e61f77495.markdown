Computational form-finding methods hold great potential for enabling resource-efficient structural design. In this context, the Combinatorial Equilibrium Modelling (CEM) allows the design of cross-typological tension-compression structures starting from an input topology diagram in the form of a graph. This paper presents an AI-assisted design workflow in which the graph modelling process required by the CEM is simplified through the application of a Graph Neural Network (GNN). To this end, a …
