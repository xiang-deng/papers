PhoBERT pre-trained models have shown its outperformance in many natural language processing tasks. Fine-tuning PhoBERT models is possibly the efficient way to build Vietnamese deep models for answer extraction. For building a Vietnamese answer extraction model using PhoBERT pre-trained model, we need a large SQuAD style annotated dataset. However, there are existing English annotated datasets for answer extraction task and multilingual BERT models which are possibly Cites: MLQA: Evaluating cross-lingual extractive question answering
