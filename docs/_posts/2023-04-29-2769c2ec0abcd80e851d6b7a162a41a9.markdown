In order to facilitate subsequent processing, the government hotline assigns hierarchical labels to the collected complaint and report texts. Classification of hierarchical multi-label text is a challenging task. Most previous studies regard hierarchical multi-label text classification as a flat multi-label classification problem, ignoring the constraints and connections between hierarchical labels. In this paper, we set hierarchical multi-label text classification as a sequence generation task, and Cites: A tree-based decoder for neural machine translation
