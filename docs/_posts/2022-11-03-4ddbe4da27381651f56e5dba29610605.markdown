Sentence Embedding is recently getting an accrued attention from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community. An embedding maps a sentence to a vector of real numbers with applications to similarity and inference tasks. Our method uses: word embeddings, dependency parsing, Hadamard matrix with spread spectrum algorithm and a deep learning neural network trained on the Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge (SICK) corpus. The dependency parsing labels are  Cites: Deep Unordered Composition Rivals Syntactic Methods for Text
