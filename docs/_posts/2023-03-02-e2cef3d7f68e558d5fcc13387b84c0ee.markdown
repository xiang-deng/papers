Current methods of dialogue modelling for Conversational AI (CAI) bear little resemblance to the manner in which humans organise conversational interactions. The way utterances are represented, interpreted, and generated are determined by the necessities of the chosen technique and do not resemble those used during natural conversation. In this research we propose a new method of representing task-oriented dialogue, for the purpose of computational modelling, which draws …
