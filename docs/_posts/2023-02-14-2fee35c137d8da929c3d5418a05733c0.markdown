Predicting throughput bottlenecks has received an increasing research attention in the recent years. Several statistical and machine learning models have been developed, with the objective of identifying future bottleneck locations for more efficient and cost-saving productions. However, bottleneck prediction remains a challenging task due to the complexity of manufacturing systems and the interactive effects from many impacting factors. This paper proposed the BSTAN (bottleneck Cites: Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for
