Neurosymbolic AI is an increasingly active area of research which aims to combine symbolic reasoning methods with deep learning to generate models with both high predictive performance and some degree of human-level comprehensibility. As knowledge graphs are becoming a popular way to represent heterogeneous and multi-relational data, methods for reasoning on graph structures have attempted to follow this neurosymbolic paradigm. Traditionally, such approaches have utilized  Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
