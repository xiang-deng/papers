Many real-world applications in medicine, finance or other domains need to combine tabular and textual data. In this paper, we present a new approach called hybrid database operations which is a new class of learned database operations that allows users to seamlessly execute SQL queries over text and tabular data. As a main contribution to enable hybrid database operations, we show how state-of-the-art pre-trained language models such as BERT can be used to implement hybrid database  Cites: TaBERT: Pretraining for Joint Understanding of Textual and
