Due to the success of the pre-trained language model (PLM), existing PLM-based summarization models show their powerful generative capability. However, these models are trained on general-purpose summarization datasets, leading to generated summaries failing to satisfy the needs of different readers. To generate summaries with topics, many efforts have been made on topic-focused summarization. However, these works generate a summary only guided by a prompt Cites: ASPECTNEWS: Aspect-Oriented Summarization of News Documents
