Entity resolution (ER) aims at matching records that refer to the same real-world entity. Although widely studied for the last 50 years, ER still represents a challenging data management problem, and several recent works have started to investigate the opportunity of applying deep learning (DL) techniques to solve this problem. In this paper, we study the fundamental problem of explainability of the DL solution for ER. Understanding the matching predictions of an ER solution is indeed crucial to assess Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
