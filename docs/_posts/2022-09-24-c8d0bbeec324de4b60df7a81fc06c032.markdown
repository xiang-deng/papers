We present an approach for systematic reasoning that produces human interpretable proof trees grounded in a factbase. Our solution resembles the style of a classic Prolog-based inference engine, where we replace handcrafted rules through a combination of neural language modeling, guided generation, and semiparametric dense retrieval. This novel reasoning engine, NELLIE, dynamically instantiates interpretable inference rules that capture and score entailment (de) compositions …
