Open-set learning deals with the testing distribution where there exist samples from the classes that are unseen during training. They aim to classify the seen classes and recognize the unseen classes. Previous studies typically assume that the marginal distribution of the seen classes is fixed across the training and testing distributions. In many real-world applications, however, there may exist covariate shift between them, ie, the marginal distribution of seen classes may shift. We call …
