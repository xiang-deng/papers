Entity Set Expansion (ESE) is a valuable task that aims to find entities of the target semantic class described by given seed entities. Various NLP and IR downstream applications have benefited from ESE due to its ability to discover knowledge. Although existing bootstrapping methods have achieved great progress, most of them still rely on manually pre-defined context patterns. A non-negligible shortcoming of the pre-defined context patterns is that they cannot be flexibly  Cites: Long-tail vocabulary dictionary extraction from the web
