Prototype learning has achieved good performance in many fields, showing higher flexibility and generalization. In this paper, we propose an efficient text line recognition method based on prototype learning with feature-level sliding windows for classification. In this framework, we combine weakly supervised discrimination and generation loss for learning feature representations with intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Then, dynamic weighting and pseudo …
