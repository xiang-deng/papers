Abstract Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims at introducing transparency and intelligibility into the decision-making process of AI systems. In recent years, most efforts were made to build XAI algorithms that are able to explain black-box models. However, in many cases, including medical and industrial applications, the explanation of a decision may be worth equally or even more than the decision itself. This imposes a question about the quality of explanations. In this work, we aim at …
