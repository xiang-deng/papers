Cross-encoder models, which jointly encode and score a query-item pair, are typically prohibitively expensive for k-nearest neighbor search. Consequently, k-NN search is performed not with a cross-encoder, but with a heuristic retrieve (eg, using BM25 or dual-encoder) and re-rank approach. Recent work proposes ANNCUR (Yadav et al., 2022) which uses CUR matrix factorization to produce an embedding space for efficient vector-based search that directly approximates the cross-encoder Cites: Sparse, dense, and attentional representations for text retrieval
