Excessive vibration of stay cables in strong winds has been a concern for bridge operators, which impairs the durability of both the cables and the bridge structure. This paper develops a data-driven approach to predict the amplitude of the cable vibration using an ensemble learning model. The model aims to predict cable vibrations in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions, with the wind speed, wind direction, turbulence intensity, and deck acceleration as input variables. Especially …
