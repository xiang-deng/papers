Recent studies on knowledge graphs (KGs) show that path-based methods empowered by pre-trained language models perform well in the provision of inductive and explainable relation predictions. In this paper, we introduce the concepts of relation path coverage and relation path confidence to filter out unreliable paths prior to model training to elevate the model performance. Moreover, we propose Knowledge Reasoning Sentence Transformer (KRST) to predict …
