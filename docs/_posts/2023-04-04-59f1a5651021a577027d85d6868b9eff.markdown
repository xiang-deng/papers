Genetic programming (GP) is a powerful method applicable to Inverse Generative Social Science (IGSS) for learning non-trivial agent logic in agent-based models (ABMs). While previous attempts at using evolutionary algorithms for learning ABM structures have focused on recombining domain-specific primitives, this paper extends prior work by developing techniques to evolve interpretable agent logic from scratch using a highly flexible domain-specific language (DSL) comprised of domain  Cites: Program synthesis with large language models
