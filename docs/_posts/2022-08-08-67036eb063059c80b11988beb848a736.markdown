Understanding agents motion behaviors under complex scenes is crucial for intelligent autonomous moving systems (like delivery robots and self-driving cars). It is challenging duo to the inherent uncertain of future trajectories and the large variation in the scene layout. However, most recent approaches ignored or underutilized the scenario information. In this work, a Multi-Granularity Scenarios Understanding framework, MGSU, is proposed to explore the scene layout from Cites: Espnet: Efficient spatial pyramid of dilated convolutions for
