Subspace clustering is the classical problem of clustering a collection of data samples that approximately lie around several low-dimensional subspaces. The current state-of-the-art approaches for this problem are based on the self-expressive model which represents the samples as linear combination of other samples. However, these approaches require sufficiently well-spread samples for accurate representation which might not be necessarily accessible in many applications.
