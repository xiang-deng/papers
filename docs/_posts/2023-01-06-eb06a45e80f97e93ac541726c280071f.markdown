Abstract Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a bio-inspired metaheuristic that operates on a set of potential solutions (called particles). In PSO, each particle moves throughout the search space using the information collected by itself and its neighbors. Experimental studies have shown that the way each particle is connected (the swarm topology) impacts the performance of PSO both for single-and multi-objective problems. Several experimental analyses have shown that the number of …
