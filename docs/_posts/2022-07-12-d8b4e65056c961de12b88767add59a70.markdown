Recent attempts to detect fake news have relied on the implementation of machine or deep learning models that have been trained on text. These models, on the other hand, are insufficient for classifying knowledge base facts or triples as fake or true. However, it is critical to assess the credibility of facts before they are included to the knowledge base. Hence, this paper suggests using a Multi-layer Perceptron to categorize a given triple as fake or true. Furthermore, extant works embed the …
