On graph data, the multitude of node or edge types gives rise to heterogeneous information networks (HINs). To preserve the heterogeneous semantics on HINs, the rich node/edge types become a cornerstone of HIN representation learning. However, in real-world scenarios, type information is often noisy, missing or inaccessible. Assuming no type information is given, we define a so-called latent heterogeneous graph (LHG), which carries latent heterogeneous semantics as the  Cites: Inferring missing entity type instances for knowledge base
