WarpDrive is a flexible, lightweight, and easy-to-use open-source framework for end-to-end deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), available at https://github. com/salesforce/warp-drive. It addresses key system bottlenecks when applying MARL to complex environments with high-dimensional state, observation, or action spaces. For example, WarpDrive eliminates data copying between the CPU and GPU and runs thousands of simulations and  Cites: The AI Economist: Taxation policy design via two-level deep
