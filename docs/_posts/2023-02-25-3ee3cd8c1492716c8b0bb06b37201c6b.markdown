The availability of new datasets and deep learning techniques have led to a surge of effort directed towards the creation of new models that can exploit the large amount of data. However, little attention has been given to the development of models that are not only accurate, but also suitable for userspecific use or geared towards resource-constrained devices. Fine-tuning deep models on edge devices is impractical and, often, user customization stands on the sub-optimal featureextractor …
