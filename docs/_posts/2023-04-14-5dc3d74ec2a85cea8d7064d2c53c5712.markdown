The goal of temporal relation extraction is to infer the temporal relation between two events in the document. Supervised models are dominant in this task. In this work, we investigate ChatGPT s ability on zero-shot temporal relation extraction. We designed three different prompt techniques to break down the task and evaluate ChatGPT. Our experiments show that ChatGPT s performance has a large gap with that of supervised methods and can heavily rely on the design of prompts. We further  Cites: Extracting or guessing? improving faithfulness of event temporal
