Passage retrieval aims to retrieve relevant passages from large collections of the open-domain corpus. Contextual Masked Auto-Encoding has been proven effective in representation bottleneck pre-training of a monolithic dual-encoder for passage retrieval. Siamese or fully separated dual-encoders are often adopted as basic retrieval architecture in the pre-training and fine-tuning stages for encoding queries and passages into their latent embedding spaces. However, simply sharing or …
