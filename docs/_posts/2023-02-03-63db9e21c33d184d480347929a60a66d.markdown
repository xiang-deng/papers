Reasoning answers to mathematical problems requires machines to think and operate like a human to learn knowledge from mathematical data, which is one of the fundamental tasks for exploring general artificial intelligence. Most solutions focus on mimicking how humans understand problems, which generate the necessary expressions for answers. However, they are still far from enough since they ignore the core ability of humans to acquire knowledge from experience. In this paper, we Cites: Solving general arithmetic word problems
