Effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of sintered Ag is an essential parameter for its die-attach application in power electronics packaging, which could vary significantly with sintering conditions. The existing ETC evaluation approaches are either of limited accuracy (analytical methods) or resource-and time-consuming (experiments and numerical simulations). In this study, deep learning method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) was first performed to predict the ETC of …
