With the rapid development of social media, the data generated from interaction, which is an action collaboratively done by several objects under a certain condition, have grown exponentially. It triggers an urgent need to cluster interaction data for implicit patterns benefiting downstream tasks. Although clustering methods have been extensively studied for a long time, they mainly focus on node/object clustering, which breaks the intrinsic collaborative associations among the involved objects and Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
