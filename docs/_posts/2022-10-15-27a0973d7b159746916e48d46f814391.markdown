Given its effectiveness on knowledge-intensive natural language processing tasks, dense retrieval models have become increasingly popular. Specifically, the de-facto architecture for open-domain question answering uses two isomorphic encoders that are initialized from the same pretrained model but separately parameterized for questions and passages. This bi-encoder architecture is parameter-inefficient in that there is no parameter sharing between encoders. Further, recent studies show that  Cites: Simple Entity-Centric Questions Challenge Dense Retrievers
