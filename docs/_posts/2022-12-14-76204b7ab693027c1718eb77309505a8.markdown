Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) convert light into electricity using photosensitizers adsorbed on the surface of nanocrystalline mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2) films along with electrolytes or solid charge-transport materials1-3. They possess many features including transparency, multicolor and low-cost fabrication, and are being deployed in glass facades, skylights and greenhouses4. Recent development of sensitizers5-10, redox mediators11-13 and device structures14 has improved the Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
