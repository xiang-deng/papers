New findings in natural language processing (NLP) demonstrate that the strong memorization capability contributes a lot to the success of large language models. This inspires us to explicitly bring an independent memory mechanism into CTR ranking model to learn and memorize all cross features representations. In this paper, we propose multi-Hash Codebook NETwork (HCNet) as the memory mechanism for efficiently learning and memorizing representations of all cross Cites: Memorization Without Overfitting: Analyzing the Training Dynamics
