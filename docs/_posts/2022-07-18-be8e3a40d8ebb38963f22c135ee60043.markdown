Spatial accelerators provide high performance, energy efficiency, and flexibility. Recent design frameworks enable these architectures to be quickly designed and customized to a domain. However, constructing a compiler for this immense design space is challenging, first because accelerators express programs with high-level idioms that are difficult to recognize. Second, it is unpredictable whether certain transformations are beneficial or will lead to infeasible hardware mappings. Our work …
