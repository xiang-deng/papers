In this chapter we provide an overview of computational modeling for semantic change using large and semi-large textual corpora. We aim to provide a key for the interpretation of relevant methods and evaluation techniques, and also provide insights into important aspects of the computational study of semantic change. We discuss the pros and cons of different classes of models with respect to the properties of the data from which one wishes to model semantic change, and which avenues …
