We consider the problem of localizing a spatio-temporal tube in a video corresponding to a given text query. This is a challenging task that requires the joint and efficient modeling of temporal, spatial and multi-modal interactions. To address this task, we propose TubeDETR, a transformer-based architecture inspired by the recent success of such models for text-conditioned object detection. Our model notably includes:(i) an efficient video and text encoder that models spatial multi Cites: Merlot: Multimodal neural script knowledge models
