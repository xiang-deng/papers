The purpose of knowledge representation learning is to learn the vector representation of research objects projected by a matrix in low-dimensional vector space and explore the relationship between embedded objects in low-dimensional space. However, most methods only consider the triple structure in the knowledge graph and ignore the additional information related to the triple, especially the text description information. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph representation  Cites: Knowledge Graph Representation with Jointly Structural and
