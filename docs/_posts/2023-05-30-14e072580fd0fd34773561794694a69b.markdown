Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities in long-form text generation tasks expressed through natural language instructions. However, user expectations for long-form text rewriting is high, and unintended rewrites ( hallucinations ) produced by the model can negatively impact its overall performance. Existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on limited rewriting styles and sentence-level rewriting rather than long-form open-ended Cites: Improving Wikipedia Verifiability with AI
