Learning visual semantic embedding for image-text matching has achieved high success by using triplet loss to pull positive image-text pairs which share similar semantic meaning and to push negative image-text pairs which share different semantic meaning. Without modeling constraints from image-image or text-text pairs, the generated visual semantic embedding inevitably faces the problem of semantic misalignments among similar images or among similar texts. To solve this problem … Cites: ‪Vinvl: Revisiting visual representations in vision-language models‬
