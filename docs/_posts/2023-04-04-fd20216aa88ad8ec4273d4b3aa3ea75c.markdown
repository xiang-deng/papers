Graph convolutional networks-based text classification methods have shown impressive success in further improving the classification results by considering the structural relationship between words and texts. However, existing GCN-based text classification methods tend to ignore the semantic representation of the node and the global structural information among nodes. Besides, only the word granularity information within the text, ie, endogenous source, is used to represent the text Cites: Graph convolution over pruned dependency trees improves
