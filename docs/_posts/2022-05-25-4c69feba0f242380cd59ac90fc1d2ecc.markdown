A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to learn new concepts purely from language. While recent advances in training machine learning models via natural language explanations show promise, these approaches still fall short on modeling the the intricacies of natural language (such as quantifiers) or in mimicking human behavior in learning a suite a tasks with varying difficulty. In this work, we present QuExEnt, to learn better zero-shot classifiers from explanations by using three  Cites: Competence-based Curriculum Learning for Neural Machine
