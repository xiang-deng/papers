Across many industries, visual quality assurance has transitioned from a manual, labor-intensive, and error-prone task to a fully automated and precise assessment of industrial quality. This transition has been made possible due to advances in machine learning in general, and supervised learning in particular. However, the majority of supervised learning approaches only allow to identify pre-defined categories, such as certain error types on manufactured objects. New, unseen error …
