Efficient representations for spatio-temporal cellular Signaling Data (SD) are essential for many human mobility applications. Traditional representation methods are mainly designed for GPS data with high spatio-temporal continuity, and thus will suffer from poor embedding performance due to the unique Ping Pong Effect in SD. To address this issue, we explore the opportunity offered by a large number of human mobility traces and mine the inherent neighboring tower connection patterns Cites: Bert: pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
