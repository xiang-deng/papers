The synthesis and photovoltaic study of five dyes based on 4H-pyranylidene moiety as donor moiety is reported. A thiophene unit conjugated with/without an ethynyl bond acts as the -relay and benzoic acid as the anchor group with/without a trifluoromethyl group. Their electrochemical and optical properties are analyzed by using a joint experimental and theoretical approach. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group leads to an enhancement of the molar extinction coefficient Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
