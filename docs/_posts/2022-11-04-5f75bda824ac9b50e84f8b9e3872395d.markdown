In many machine learning applications, it is important for the user to understand the reasoning behind the recommendation or prediction of the classifiers. The learned models, however, are often too complicated to be understood by a human. Research from the social sciences indicates that humans prefer counterfactual explanations over alternatives. In this paper, we present a general framework for generating counterfactual explanations in the textual domain. Our framework is model-agnostic …
