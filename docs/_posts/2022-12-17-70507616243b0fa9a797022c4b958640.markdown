Artificial neural networks offer great classification performances, but their internal model works as a black box. This can prevent their outcomes to be employed in real-world decision-making processes, eg, in smart manufacturing. To address this issue, the neural network should provide human-comprehensible explanations for their outcomes. This can be achieved by exploiting domain concepts and measuring their importance for the classification. To this aim, we implement an information …
