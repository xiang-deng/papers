Federated learning (FL) is a new artificial intelligence concept that enables Internet- of-Things (IoT) devices to learn a collaborative model without sending the raw data to centralized nodes for processing. Despite numerous advantages, low computing resources at IoT devices and high communication costs for exchanging model parameters make applications of FL in massive IoT networks very limited. In this work, we develop a novel compression scheme for FL, called high-compression Cites: Directional Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent via von Mises
