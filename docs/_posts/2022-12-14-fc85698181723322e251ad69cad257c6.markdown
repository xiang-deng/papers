In this paper, we propose a control synthesis method for signal temporal logic (STL) specifications with neural networks (NNs). Most of the previous works consider training a controller for only a given STL specification. These approaches, however, require retraining the NN controller if a new specification arises and needs to be satisfied, which results in large consumption of memory and inefficient training. To tackle this problem, we propose to construct NN controllers by introducing encoder  Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
