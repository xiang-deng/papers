Generating confidence calibrated outputs is of utmost importance for the applications of deep neural networks in safety-critical decision-making systems. The output of a neural network is a probability distribution where the scores are estimated confidences of the input belonging to the corresponding classes, and hence they represent a complete estimate of the output likelihood relative to all classes. In this paper, we propose a novel form of label smoothing to improve confidence Cites: Verified uncertainty calibration
