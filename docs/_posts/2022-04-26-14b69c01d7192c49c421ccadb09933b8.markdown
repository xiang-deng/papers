The wide deployment of IoT sensors has enabled the collection of very big time series across different domains, from which advanced analytics can be performed to find unknown relationships, most importantly the correlations between them. However, current approaches for correlation search on time series are limited to only a single temporal scale and simple types of relations, and cannot handle noise effectively.
