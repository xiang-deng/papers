The research on temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) has received increasing attention. Since knowledge graphs are always incomplete, knowledge reasoning problems are crucial. However, knowledge reasoning is challenging due to the temporal evolution of TKGs. Yet, most existing approaches focus on knowledge graph inference within past timestamps and cannot predict upcoming facts. There is evidence that when temporal facts in TKGs are evolving and interacting, most of them …
