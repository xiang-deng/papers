In natural language generation, most decoding methods are not intrinsic because their performance depends on extrinsically configured hyperparameters. It means that: first, the generation system is dynamic under different conditions while the decoding system is always static under any conditions once its hyperparameters are extrinsically fixed; second, it is hard to select a constant decoding hyperparameter that is omnipotent for all conditions. Although there are decoding methods that are …
