When a crowdsourcing approach is used to assist the classification of a set of items, the main objective is to classify this set of items by aggregating the worker-provided labels. A secondary objective is to assess the workers skill levels in this process. A classical model that achieves both objectives is the famous Dawid-Skene model. In this paper, we consider a third objective in this context, namely, to learn a classifier that is capable of labelling future items without further assistance of crowd workers  Cites: Optimistic knowledge gradient policy for optimal budget allocation
