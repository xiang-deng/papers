Document-level event argument extraction (EAE), a critical task for event knowledge acquisition, seeks to find event arguments beyond the sentence level. Previous approaches for this task adopt supervised learning, which suffers from the data scarcity issue, especially in low-resource situations. To address this challenge, we propose a new method for document-level EAE that addresses the data scarcity from two perspectives: self-augmentation and cross-domain joint training. On the one …
