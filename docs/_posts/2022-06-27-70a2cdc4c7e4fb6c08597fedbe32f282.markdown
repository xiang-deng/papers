Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used for object recognition and grasping posture planning in intelligent robotic grasping (IRG). Compared with the traditional usage of CNNs in image recognition, IRGs require high recognition accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the existing methodologies for CNN architecture design often rely on human experience and numerous trial-and-error attempts, which make it a very challenging task to obtain an optimal CNN for …
