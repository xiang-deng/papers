Information extraction aims at extracting entities, relations, etc., in text to support information retrieval systems. To extract information, researchers have considered multitask learning (ML) approaches. The conventional ML approach learns shared features across tasks, with the assumption that these features capture sufficient task interactions to learn expressive shared representations for task classification. However, such an assumption is flawed in different perspectives. First, the shared …
