Abstract Exemplar-guided Paraphrase Generation aims to use an exemplar sentence to guide the generation of a paraphrase that retains the semantic content of the source sentence, along with the syntax of the exemplar. Some methods use syntax structure extracted from exemplars to guide generation, but the preprocesses may cause information loss. The other methods directly use the natural exemplar sentences (NES) as syntactic guidance, which avoids the loss of information but fails Cites: Syn-QG: Syntactic and shallow semantic rules for question
