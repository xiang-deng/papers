Despite substantial advancements, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models often require post-training adjustments to enforce business rules, rectify undesired behavior, and align with user values. These adjustments involve operationalizing  concepts --dictating desired model responses to certain inputs. However, it s difficult for a single entity to enumerate and define all possible concepts, indicating a need for a multi-user, collaborative model alignment framework. Moreover, the exhaustive …
