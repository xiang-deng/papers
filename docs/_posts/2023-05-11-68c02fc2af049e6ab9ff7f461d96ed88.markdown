A neuron with binary inputs and a binary output represents a Boolean function. Our goal is to extract this Boolean function into a tractable representation that will facilitate the explanation and formal verification of a neuron s behavior. Unfortunately, extracting a neuron s Boolean function is in general an NP-hard problem. However, it was recently shown that prime implicants of this Boolean function can be enumerated efficiently, with only polynomial time delay. Building on …
