To support efficient design automation for emerging computing fabrics, novel data structures for logic synthesis and technology mapping are being intensively studied. It has been shown that for several promising computing technologies intermediate forms like Majority-Inverter Graph (MIG), and Xor-Majority Graph (XMG) can be particularly beneficial. This has propelled the Boolean majority operator at the forefront of research. Though these structures primarily utilise 3-input Majority nodes Cites: Saturated transformers are constant-depth threshold circuits
