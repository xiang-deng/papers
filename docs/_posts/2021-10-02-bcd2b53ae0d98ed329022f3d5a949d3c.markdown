The paper concerns a novel problem of summarising entities with lim-ited presentation budget on entity-relationship knowledge graphs and propose an efficient algorithm for solving this problem. The algorithm has been implemented in two variants: undirected and directed, together with a visualisation tool. Ex- perimental user evaluation of the algorithm was conducted on real large semantic knowledge graphs extracted from the web.
