In the current big-data context of Industry 4.0, insufficient training data has become a major bottleneck in developing data-driven diagnosis approaches, restricting the accuracy of deep networks. Targeting this issue, this study proposes a novel fault diagnosis method incorporating data augmentation and transfer learning, which is branded as SA-SN-DCGAN-TL. The SA-SN-DCGAN method is used to generate sufficient synthetic images to meet the training requirement, which integrates the  Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
