Aspect-level sentiment analysis (ALSA) is a fine-grained task for classifying the sentiment polarity of a specific aspect in a sentence. In spite of the progress in deep- learning algorithms within natural language processing domain, the methods in line with human cognition are absent. Inspired by the processing principle of our brain, we propose a Bilateral-brain-like Semantic and Syntactic Cognitive Network (BSSCN) for aspect-level sentiment analysis. There are four major modules Cites: Effective LSTMs for target-dependent sentiment classification
