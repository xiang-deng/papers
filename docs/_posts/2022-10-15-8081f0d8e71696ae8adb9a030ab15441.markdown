Multi-label learning has attracted significant attention from both academic and industry field in recent decades. Although existing multi-label learning algorithms achieved good performance in various tasks, they implicitly assume the size of target label space is not huge, which can be restrictive for real-world scenarios. Moreover, it is infeasible to directly adapt them to extremely large label space because of the compute and memory overhead. Therefore, eXtreme Multi-label Learning (XML) is …
