With the aim of constructing a low-dimensionsal representation space, knowledge graph embedding has gradually become a hot spot in various information retrieval and machine learning tasks. However, most existing knowledge graphs suffer from incompleteness due to the fact that it is unable to collect a complete world knowledge. For knowledge graph completion (KGC), this paper introduces a novel embedding method, named gated Convolution for Knowledge Graph (GCKG), to Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
