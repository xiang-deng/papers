Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is an important component for natural language understanding (Palmer et al. 2013). It identifies the semantic role of words, abstracting away superficial variations caused by ways of expression. Semantic dependencies (upper part of Figure 1) embody such information, specifying the semantic role label actor of the argument it to the predicate eliminate. Semantic dependency provides useful information for tasks such as question answering (Yih et …
