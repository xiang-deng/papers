We present a partially personalized formulation of Federated Learning (FL) that strikes a balance between the flexibility of personalization and cooperativeness of global training. In our framework, we split the variables into global parameters, which are shared across all clients, and individual local parameters, which are kept private. We prove that under the right split of parameters, it is possible to find global parameters that allow each client to fit their data perfectly, and refer to the obtained …
