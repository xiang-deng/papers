Although existing machine reading comprehension models are making rapid progress on many datasets, they are far from robust. In this paper, we propose an understanding-oriented machine reading comprehension model to address three kinds of robustness issues, which are over sensitivity, over stability and generalization. Specifically, we first use a natural language inference module to help the model understand the accurate semantic meanings of input questions so as to Cites: ContractNLI: A dataset for document-level natural language
