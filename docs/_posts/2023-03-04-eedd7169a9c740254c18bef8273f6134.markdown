Utterance rewriting condenses a sparse, multi-turn context into a single, self-contained utterance. It has demonstrated superb effectiveness in response generation. Prior techniques mainly rely on machine translation technology to translate the last (incomplete) utterance in the context into a complete utterance. Such a rewriting paradigm contrasts with the main characteristic of the task, that is, the source and target utterances are mostly the same with only a small portion of  Cites: QuAC: Question Answering in Context
