Sentence representation approaches have been widely used and proven to be effective in many text modeling tasks and downstream applications. Many recent proposals are available on learning sentence representations based on deep neural frameworks. However, these methods are pre-trained in open domains and depend on the availability of large-scale data for model fitting. As a result, they may fail in some special scenarios, where data are sparse and embedding interpretations are  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
