The final assembled state is one of the crucial factors in the quality of an aeroengine pipeline system. It directly affects the safety, reliability, and thrust-to-weight ratio. Because of the limitations of aeroengine assembly and inspection technologies, ensuring the consistent assembly of pipeline systems in aeroengine production has become a challenging and key issue. We inspect the assembly of an aeroengine pipeline system with high precision and reliability using a single-frame point cloud …
