As technology accelerates the generation and communication of textual data, the need to automatically understand this content becomes a necessity. In order to classify text, being it for tagging, indexing or curating documents, one often relies on large, opaque models that are trained on pre-annotated datasets, making the process unexplainable, difficult to scale and ill-adapted for niche domains with scarce data. To tackle these challenges, we propose ProZe, a text classification  Cites: Benchmarking zero-shot text classification: Datasets, evaluation
