Supervised semantic segmentation often fails to generalize well in unseen scenarios due to the domain gap between the source and the target domains. Unsupervised domain adaptation is one possible way to solve this problem. However, the existing methods suffer two limitations. First, the number limitation of samples may lead to decreasing generalization. Second, only the source dataset contains pixel-level annotations, which provide stronger supervision in the source domain and result in Cites: Self-training with noisy student improves imagenet classification
