Sequential recommendation (SR) is an essential component of modern recommender systems. It models the dynamic interest of users based on their sequential interactions. Recently, several studies have utilized sequential deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks and Transformers to facilitate sequential recommendation, which shows promising results. Inspired by the rise of contrastive learning techniques, some methods are devoted to enhance sequential  Cites: RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach
