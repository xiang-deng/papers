Free-text rationales are a promising step towards explainable AI, yet their evaluation remains an open research problem. While existing metrics have mostly focused on measuring the direct association between the rationale and a given label, we argue that an ideal metric should also be able to focus on the new information uniquely provided in the rationale that is otherwise not provided in the input or the label. We investigate this research problem from an information-theoretic perspective using the Cites: Chain of thought prompting elicits reasoning in large language
