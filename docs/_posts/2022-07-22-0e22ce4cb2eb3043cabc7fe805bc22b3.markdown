We consider the problem of combining machine learning models to perform higher-level cognitive tasks with clear specifications. We propose the novel problem of Visual Discrimination Puzzles (VDP) that requires finding interpretable discriminators that classify images according to a logical specification. Humans can solve these puzzles with ease and they give robust, verifiable, and interpretable discriminators as answers. We propose a compositional neurosymbolic framework that combines a  Cites: Neuro-symbolic program synthesis
