Pre-training for e nd-to-end t ask-o riented d ialogue s ystems (EToDs) is a challenging task due to its unique knowledge base query (accuracy) need and lack of sufficient training data (fluency). In this paper, we try to mitigate the above challenges by introducing a modularized pre-training framework for EToDs, which achieves to effectively improve both accuracy and fluency of EToDs through a pre-training paradigm. The core insight is a modular design by decomposing EToDs into Cites: A simple language model for task-oriented dialogue
