The detection of textual Emotion-Cause Pair causality is very helpful for improving the accuracy of emotion-cause extraction and understanding the causes behind specific events. To solve the polysemy problem of static word vector representation in word2vec, an Emotion-Cause Pair causality discrimination model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) is proposed. Firstly, each independent clause in the document is transformed into a word vector  Cites: A multi-axis annotation scheme for event temporal relations
