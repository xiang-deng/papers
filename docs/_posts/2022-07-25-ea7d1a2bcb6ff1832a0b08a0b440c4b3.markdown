Panoptic segmentation is a recent and powerful task that tackles individual object recognition (things) and multiple backgrounds (stuff) simultaneously. Remote sensing studies with panoptic segmentation are still restricted and recent, with great application perspectives. In this sense, we propose the first multispectral panoptic segmentation study, considering the thing and stuff classes in the beach scenario and evaluating different sets of spectral bands. Our methodology included  Cites: Augmentation for small object detection
