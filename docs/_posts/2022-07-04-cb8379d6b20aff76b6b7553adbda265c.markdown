Behaviors of karst springs are manifestations of spatial and temporal dynamics involving multi-hydrogeological processes, including precipitation, surface water runoff, infiltration, groundwater flow, and anthropogenic activities. These dynamic processes are usually nonlinear and nonstationary. In this study, we couple the Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to produce an interpretable deep learning model to explore …
