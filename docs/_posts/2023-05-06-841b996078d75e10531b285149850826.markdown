Discrete reasoning over table-text documents (eg, financial reports) gains increasing attention in recent two years. Existing works mostly simplify this challenge by manually selecting and transforming document pages to structured tables and paragraphs, hindering their practical application. In this work, we explore a more realistic problem setting in the form of TAT-DQA, ie to answer the question over a visually-rich table-text document. Specifically, we propose a novel Doc2SoarGraph Cites: DROP: A Reading Comprehension Benchmark Requiring Discrete
