We propose a novel open-domain question answering (ODQA) framework for answering single/multi-hop questions across heterogeneous knowledge sources. The key novelty of our method is the introduction of the intermediary modules into the current retriever-reader pipeline. Unlike previous methods that solely rely on the retriever for gathering all evidence in isolation, our intermediary performs a chain of reasoning over the retrieved set. Specifically, our method links the retrieved evidence …
