The analysis of rocks plays an important role in geological and petroleum-engineering problems. In these tasks, core (ie, core-log) is a crucial element since it provides underlying information on the geophysical properties of the area. Thereby, works often leverage core data to assign the correct category from well-logs. Unfortunately, processing core is laborious and time-consuming; hence, its analysis takes long periods. For example, for a single well, a human could have to adjust Cites: Catformer: Designing stable transformers via sensitivity analysis
