Background The side-channel cryptanalysis method based on convolutional neural network (CNNSCA) can effectively carry out cryptographic attacks. The CNNSCA network models that achieve cryptanalysis mainly include CNNSCA based on the VGG variant (VGG-CNNSCA) and CNNSCA based on the Alexnet variant (Alex- CNNSCA). The learning ability and cryptanalysis performance of these CNNSCA models are not optimal, and the trained model has low accuracy, too long training Cites: Convolutional recurrent neural networks for music classification
