The progress made in code modeling has been tremendous in recent years thanks to the design of natural language processing learning approaches based on state-of- the-art model architectures. Nevertheless, we believe that the current state-of-the-art does not focus enough on the full potential that data may bring to a learning process in software engineering. Our vision articulates on the idea of leveraging multi-modal learning approaches to modeling the programming world. In this paper, we Cites: Dawn Drain, Daxin Jiang, Duyu Tang, et al. 2021.
