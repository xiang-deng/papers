The social media data (SMD) have been viewed as a potential and promising information source of road conditions. However, most existing SMD-based sensing approaches (SMDSAs) either ignore interrelations among information items (eg, name, direction, and status of the road) or rely on rigid grammar rules to establish entities interrelations.
