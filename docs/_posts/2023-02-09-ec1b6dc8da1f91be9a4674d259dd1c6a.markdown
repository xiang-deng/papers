MDPs with low-rank transitions--that is, the transition matrix can be factored into the product of two matrices, left and right--is a highly representative structure that enables tractable learning. The left matrix enables expressive function approximation for value-based learning and has been studied extensively. In this work, we instead investigate sample-efficient learning with density features, ie, the right matrix, which induce powerful models for state-occupancy distributions. This setting not only sheds  Cites: Breaking the curse of horizon: Infinite-horizon off-policy estimation
