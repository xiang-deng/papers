In acoustic scene classification (ASC) task, an acoustic scene consists of diverse attributes and is inferred by identifying combinations of some distinct attributes among them. This study aims to extract and cluster these attributes effectively using a multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework for ASC. MIL, known as one of the weakly supervised learning methods, is a way to extract instances from input data and infer a scene corresponding to the input data with those unlabeled instances. We develop Cites: Multiple instance learning networks for fine-grained sentiment
