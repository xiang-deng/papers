Integrating data in data lakes is essential so we can perform more complex analyses. However, data lakes are mainly composed of raw data, from structured, semi-structured, and even unstructured data. It turns out that traditional data integration algorithms usually expect to receive structured data as input, so those different types of data jeopardize big data integration. This paper presents a systematic literature review that generates a broad landscape about data integration in data lakes. We  Cites: Towards Data Discovery by Example
