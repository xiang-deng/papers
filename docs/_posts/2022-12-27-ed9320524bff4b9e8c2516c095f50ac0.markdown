Predictions about upcoming content play an important role during language comprehension and processing. Semantic similarity as a metric has been used to predict how words are processed in context in language comprehension and processing tasks. This study proposes a novel, dynamic approach for computing contextual semantic similarity, evaluates the extent to which the semantic similarity measures computed using this approach can predict fixation durations in reading Cites: Composition in distributional models of semantics
