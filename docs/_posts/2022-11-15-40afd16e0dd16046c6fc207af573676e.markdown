Aerodynamic shape design may involve complicated geometric optimization problems. When the number of geometric decision variables increases, the optimization algorithms can still search for solutions automatically, but it would work more like a black-box, for which the explanation will be of great help. This paper focuses on further mining the explanatory information of the shape optimization. A multi-objective optimization of a spacecraft is performed as a simplified case study Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
