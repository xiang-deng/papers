In an NPP, there are more than 10,000 sensors installed to measure all the various plant parameters. Clearly, valid and precise signals from sensors are a prerequisite for both the safety and the efficient operation of the plant. In the case of faulty sensors and signals, the performance of the operators and control systems may be degraded. This may lead to an undesirable situation that compromises NPP safety as learned from the Three Mile Island Three Mile Island accident (TMI) and Fukushima Daiichi Cites: Language generation with recurrent generative adversarial
