Purpose This study sought to develop and internally validate a machine learning model to identify risk factors and quantify overall risk of secondary meniscus injury in a longitudinal cohort after primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Methods Patients with new ACL injury between 1990 and 2016 with minimum 2-year follow-up were identified. Records were extensively reviewed to extract demographic, treatment, and diagnosis of new meniscus injury following ACLR.
