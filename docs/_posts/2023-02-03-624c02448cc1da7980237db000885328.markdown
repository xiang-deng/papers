We used machine learning classifiers and dialog state tracking models, combined with natural language processing techniques relying on lexicon-based methods and data-driven methods, to automatically detect positive and negative microbehaviors between team members in nine, four-person teams in a simulated space habitat. Our findings indicate that the psycholinguistic markers extracted using the linguistic inquiry and word count, STRESSnet dictionaries, and acoustic features can achieve …
