In this paper, we introduce the task of learning unsupervised dialogue embeddings. Trivial approaches such as combining pre-trained word or sentence embeddings and encoding through pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been shown to be feasible for this task. However, these approaches typically ignore the conversational interactions between interlocutors, resulting in poor performance. To address this issue, we proposed a self-guided contrastive learning approach named dial2vec Cites: TOD-BERT: Pre-trained natural language understanding for task
