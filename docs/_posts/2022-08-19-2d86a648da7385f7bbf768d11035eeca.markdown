Heterogeneous sequential recommendation that models sequences of items associated with more than one type of feedback such as examinations and purchases is an emerging topic in the research community, which is also an important problem in many real-world applications. Though there are some methods proposed to exploit different types of feedback in item sequences such as RLBL, RIB and BINN, they are based on RNN and may not be very competitive in capturing Cites: Effective approaches to attention-based neural machine translation
