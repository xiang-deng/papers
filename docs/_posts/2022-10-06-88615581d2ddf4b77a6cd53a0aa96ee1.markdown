The development of industry is inseparable from the support of steel materials, and the modern industry has increasingly high requirements for the quality of steel plates. But the process of steel plate production produces many types of defects, such as roll marks, scratches, and scars. These defects will directly affect the quality and performance of the steel plate, so it is necessary to effectively detect them. Steel plate surface defects are characterized by their types, shape, and size: the same defect Cites: Graph convolution over pruned dependency trees improves
