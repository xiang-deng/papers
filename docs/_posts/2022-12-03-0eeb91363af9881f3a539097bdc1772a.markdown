Recent studies have shown the impressive efficacy of counterfactually augmented data (CAD) for reducing NLU models reliance on spurious features and improving their generalizability. However, current methods still heavily rely on human efforts or task-specific designs to generate counterfactuals, thereby impeding CAD s applicability to a broad range of NLU tasks. In this paper, we present AutoCAD, a fully automatic and task-agnostic CAD generation framework. AutoCAD first  Cites: Generating Data to Mitigate Spurious Correlations in Natural
