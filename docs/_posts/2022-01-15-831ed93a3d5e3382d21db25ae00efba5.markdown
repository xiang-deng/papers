We present a new open-source and extensible knowledge extraction toolkit, called DeepKE (Deep learning based Knowledge Extraction), supporting standard fully supervised, low-resource few-shot and document-level scenarios. DeepKE implements various information extraction tasks, including named entity recognition, relation extraction and attribute extraction. With a unified framework, DeepKE allows developers and researchers to customize datasets and models to extract information Cites: Graph convolution over pruned dependency trees improves
