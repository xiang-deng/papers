Manufacturing wafers is an intricate task involving thousands of steps. Defect Pattern Recognition (DPR) of wafer maps is crucial for determining the root cause of production defects, which may further provide insight for yield improvement in wafer foundry. During manufacturing, various defects may appear standalone in the wafer or may appear as different combinations. Identifying multiple defects in a wafer is generally harder compared to identifying a single defect. Recently, deep learning  Cites: A unified understanding of deep nlp models for text classification
