Deep learning-based object detection and classification in 3D point clouds has numerous applications including defense, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. A challenge in applying deep learning to point clouds is the frequent scarcity of labeled data. Often, one must manually label a large quantity of data for the model to be useful in application. To overcome this challenge, active learning provides a means of minimizing the manual labeling required. The crux of active learning … Cites: ‪Margin-based active learning for structured output spaces‬
