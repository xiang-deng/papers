Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) provides a principled framework for a group of artificial intelligence agents to learn collaborative and/or competitive behaviors at the level of human experts. Multiagent learning settings inherently solve much more complex problems than single-agent learning because an agent interacts both with the environment and other agents. In particular, multiple agents simultaneously learn in MARL, leading to natural non-stationarity in the experiences …
