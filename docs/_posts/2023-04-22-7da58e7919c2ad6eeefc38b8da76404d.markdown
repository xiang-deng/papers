Abstract The introduction of Quantum Theory (QT) provides a unified mathematical framework for Information Retrieval (IR). Compared with the classical IR framework, the quantuminspired IR framework is based on user-centered modeling methods to model non-classical cognitive phenomena in human relevance judgment in the IR process. With the increase of data and computing resources, neural IR methods have been applied to the text matching and understanding task of IR. Neural networks …
