Web-based online interactive visual analytics enjoys popularity in recent years. Traditionally, visualizations are produced directly from querying the underlying data. However, for a very large dataset, this way is so time-consuming that it cannot meet the low-latency requirements of interactive visual analytics. In this paper, we propose a learning-based visualization approach called BlinkViz, which uses a learned model to produce approximate visualizations by leveraging mixed sum-product Cites: Visualization-aware sampling for very large databases
