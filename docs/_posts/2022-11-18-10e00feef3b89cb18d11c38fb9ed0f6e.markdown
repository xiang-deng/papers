We are at the cusp of a transition from learning from data to learning what data to learn from as a central focus of artificial intelligence (AI) research. While the first-order learning problem is not completely solved, large models under unified architectures, such as transformers, have shifted the learning bottleneck from how to effectively train our models to how to effectively acquire and use task-relevant data. This problem, which we frame as exploration, is a universal aspect of learning in Cites: Lamda: Language models for dialog applications
