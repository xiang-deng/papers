One of the most predominant techniques that have achieved phenomenal success in many modern applications is deep learning. The obsession with massive data analysis in image recognition, speech processing, and text understanding spawns remarkable advances in deep learning of diverse research areas. The alliance of deep learning technologies yields mighty graph neural networks (GNNs), an emerging type of deep neural networks that encodes internal structural relationships … Cites: ‪Blockwise Self-Attention for Long Document Understanding‬
