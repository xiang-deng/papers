We demonstrate that the extreme ultraviolet free induction decay emission can be significantly enhanced by employing isolated attosecond pulses. In this work, the near infrared pulses are applied to excite the neon atoms into Rydberg states coherently, and isolated attosecond pulses are used to manipulate the populations of the Rydberg states and the subsequent free induction decay process. The time resolved experimental measurement of the dependence of the resonance emission …
