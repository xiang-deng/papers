In high connectivity knowledge graph, distance based knowledge graph embedding methods show promising performance on link prediction task, and are capable of encoding complex relations and key relation patterns. However, the existing methods fail to achieve excellent results in knowledge graph with poor context structure information. To mitigate this problem, we propose Bi2E, a bidirectional model based on subject-object feature spaces. To enhance the efficiency of data utilization and Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
