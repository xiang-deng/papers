Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful way to solve sequential decision-making tasks. However training an RL agent in a complex environment requires a large amount of interactions, which is non-ideal when acting in an environment is costly or dangerous. One alternative is to learn an approximation of the real environment, referred to as a world model. This simulator can be used to train an agent and transfer the learned policy to the real environment. Unfortunately, training world Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
