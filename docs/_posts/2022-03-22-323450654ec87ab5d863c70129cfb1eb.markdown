Graph based Semi-Supervised Learning (GSSL) has been attracting more and more attention with its intuitiveness and good learning performance in the machine learning community. However, it is found that existing graph based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) method has the problem of poor robustness/sensitivity to noise/abnormal data by analysis. In addition, the premise of GSSL method s good performance is that the training data and test data with the independently identically Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
