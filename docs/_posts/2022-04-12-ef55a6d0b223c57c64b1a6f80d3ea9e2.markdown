Purpose of review: Recent advances in sensing, actuation, and computation have opened the door to multi-robot systems consisting of hundreds/thousands of robots, with promising applications to automated manufacturing, disaster relief, harvesting, last-mile delivery, port/airport operations, or search and rescue. The community has leveraged model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to devise efficient, scalable controllers for multi-robot systems (MRS). This review aims to provide an Cites: Pommerman: A multi-agent playground
