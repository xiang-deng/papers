Human language users can generate descriptions of perceptual concepts beyond instance-level representations and also use such descriptions to learn provisional class-level representations. However, the ability of computational models to learn and operate with class representations is under-investigated in the language-and-vision field. In this paper, we train separate neural networks to generate and interpret class-level descriptions. We then use the zero-shot classification performance of the  Cites: Experience grounds language
