This paper presents the shared task on Multilingual Idiomaticity Detection and Sentence Embedding, which consists of two subtasks:(a) a binary classification one aimed at identifying whether a sentence contains an idiomatic expression, and (b) a task based on semantic text similarity which requires the model to adequately represent potentially idiomatic expressions in context. Each subtask includes different settings regarding the amount of training data. Besides the task description Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
