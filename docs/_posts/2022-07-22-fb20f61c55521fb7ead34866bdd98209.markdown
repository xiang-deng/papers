Recent methods in network pruning have indicated that a dense neural network involves a sparse subnetwork (called a winning ticket), which can achieve similar test accuracy to its dense counterpart with much fewer network parameters. Generally, these methods search for the winning tickets on well-labeled data. Unfortunately, in many real-world applications, the training data are unavoidably contaminated with noisy labels, thereby leading to performance deterioration of these methods.
