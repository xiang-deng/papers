Abstract Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) aims to retain the intrinsic structural information of knowledge graphs (KGs) via representation learning, which is critical for various downstream tasks including personalized recommendations, intelligent search, and relation extraction. The graph convolutional network (GCN), due to its remarkable performance in modeling graph data, has recently been studied extensively in the KGE field. However, when learning entity representations, most Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
