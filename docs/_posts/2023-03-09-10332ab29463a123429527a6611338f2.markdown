Classifiers based on a deep neural architecture inspired by the transformer, as proposed by Vaswani et al.(2017)[Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 5998-6008)], were developed and studied with regards to their performance on the task of detecting different types of cardiac arrhythmia in 12-lead ECG signals. All classifiers were trained on the Shaoxin Peopleâ s Hospi-tal 12-lead ECG database and further evaluated on the PTB-XL database. Two different …
