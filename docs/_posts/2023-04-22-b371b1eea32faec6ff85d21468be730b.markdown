The self-attention revolution allowed generative language models to scale and achieve increasingly impressive abilities. Such models-commonly referred to as Large Language Models (LLMs)-have recently gained prominence with the general public, thanks to conversational fine-tuning, putting their behavior in line with public expectations regarding AI. This prominence amplified prior concerns regarding the misuse of LLMs and led to the emergence of numerous tools to detect LLMs in the Cites: Program Synthesis with Large Language Models.
