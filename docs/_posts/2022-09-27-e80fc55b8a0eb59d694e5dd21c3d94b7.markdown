Deep learning has been increasingly successful in the last few years, but its inherent limitations have recently become more evident, especially with respect to explainability and interpretability. Neural-symbolic approaches to inductive logic programming have been recently proposed to synergistically combine the advantages of inductive logic programming in terms of explainability and interpretability with the characteristic capability of deep learning to treat noisy …
