The evaluation of student projects is a difficult task, especially when they involve both a technical and a creative component. We propose an AI-based methodology to help in the evaluation of complex projects in Engineering and Computer Science courses. This methodology is intended to evaluate the assessment process itself allowing to analyze the influence of each variable in the final grade, to discover possible biases, inconsistencies and discrepancies, and to generate appropriate rubrics that help to Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
