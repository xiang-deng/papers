Deep learning models, and in particular neural networks, have become ubiquitous in modern computing. Neural networks can be found in spam and malware detection systems [1], bug fixing tools [24], at numerous parts of the stack in self driving cars [5, 6], in aircraft collision avoidance systems [7], facial recognition for authentication [8], health-care [9, 10], in algorithmic trading [11, 12], and even at the base of stacks that power generic upstream code tools such as compilers and SMT solvers [1315]  Cites: Certified robustness to adversarial word substitutions
