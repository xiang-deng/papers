PEDOT-based counter electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are generally prepared by electrodeposition, which produces polymer films endowed with the best electrocatalytic properties. This translates in fast regeneration of the redox mediator, which allows the solar cell to sustain efficient photoconversion. The sustainable fabrication of DSSCs must consider the scaling up of the entire process, and when possible, it should avoid the use of large amounts of hazardous and/or Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
