Abstract Although the Knowledge Graph (KG) has been successfully applied to various applications, there is still a large amount of incomplete knowledge in the KG. This study proposes a Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) method based on the Graph Attention Faded Mechanism (GAFM) to solve the problem of incomplete knowledge in KG. GAFM introduces a graph attention network that incorporates the information in multi-hop neighborhood nodes to embed the target entities into low …
