Aspect-based sentiment information extraction has attracted increasing attention in the research community of natural language processing. Various methods, such as sequence tagging, sequence-to-sequence generation and span-based extraction, have been proposed, which own different advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we revisit the span-based method for aspect-sentiment-opinion triplet extraction, by designing and analyzing a simple yet effective Span-based Model Cites: Bart: Denoising sequence-to-sequence pre-training for natural
