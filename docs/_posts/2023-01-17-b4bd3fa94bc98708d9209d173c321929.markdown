We present a novel hierarchical modeling method for layout representation learning, the core of design documents (eg, user interface, poster, template). Existing works on layout representation often ignore element hierarchies, which is an important facet of layouts, and mainly rely on the spatial bounding boxes for feature extraction. This paper proposes a Spatial-Structural Hierarchical Auto-Encoder (SSHAE) that learns hierarchical representation by treating a hierarchically annotated layout as a tree …
