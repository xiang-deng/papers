Denoising diffusion models have emerged as one of the most powerful generative models in recent years. They have achieved remarkable success in many fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and bioinformatics. Although there are a few excellent reviews on diffusion models and their applications in computer vision and NLP, there is a lack of an overview of their applications in bioinformatics. This review aims to provide a rather thorough overview of the Cites: Optimal tuning of weighted kNN-and diffusion-based methods for
