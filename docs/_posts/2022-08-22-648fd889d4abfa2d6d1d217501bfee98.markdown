Twitter bot detection is an important and meaningful task. Existing text-based methods can deeply analyze user tweet content, achieving high performance. However, novel Twitter bots evade these detections by stealing genuine users tweets and diluting malicious content with benign tweets. These novel bots are proposed to be characterized by semantic inconsistency. In addition, methods leveraging Twitter graph structure are recently emerging, showing great Cites: GreaseLM: Graph REASoning Enhanced Language Models for
