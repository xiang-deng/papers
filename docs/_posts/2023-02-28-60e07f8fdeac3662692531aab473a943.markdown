Action detection of construction equipment is critical for tracking project performance, facilitating construction automation, and fostering construction efficiency in terms of construction site monitoring. Particularly, the auditory signal can provide additional information on computer visionbased action detection of various types of construction equipment. Therefore, this study aims to develop a visualauditory learning network model for the action detection of construction equipment based on Cites: Knowing when to look: Adaptive attention via a visual sentinel for
