Federated learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning (ML) paradigm that enables heterogeneous edge devices to collaboratively train ML models without revealing their raw data to a logically centralized server. Heterogeneity across participants is a fundamental challenge in FL, both in terms of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data distributions and variations in device capabilities. Many existing works present point solutions to address issues like slow …
