Extractive models usually formulate text summarization as extracting top-k important sentences from document as summary. Few work exploited extracting finer-grained Elementary Discourse Unit (EDU) and there is little analysis and justification for the extractive unit selection. To fill such a gap, this paper firstly conducts oracle analysis to compare the upper bound of performance for models based on EDUs and sentences. The analysis provides evidences from both theoretical and experimental  Cites: Discourse-Aware Neural Extractive Text Summarization
