The problem of text classification has been a mainstream research branch in natural language processing, and how to improve the effect of classification under the scarcity of labeled samples is one of the hot issues in this direction. The current models supporting small-sample classification can learn knowledge and train models with a small number of labels, but the classification results are not satisfactory enough. In order to improve the classification accuracy, we propose a …
