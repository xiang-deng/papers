Knowledge graphs are increasingly used in a plethora of downstream tasks or in the augmentation of statistical models to improve factuality.

We conducted a critical analysis of literature concerning biases at different steps of a knowledge graph lifecycle. We investigated factors introducing bias, as well as the biases that are rendered by knowledge graphs and their embedded versions afterward Cites: Position-aware Attention and Supervised Data Improve Slot Filling
