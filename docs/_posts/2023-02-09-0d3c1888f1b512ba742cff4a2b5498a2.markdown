Despite the availability and ease of collecting a large amount of free, unlabeled data, the expensive and time-consuming labeling process is still an obstacle to labeling a sufficient amount of training data, which is essential for building supervised learning models. Here, with low labeling cost, the active learning (AL) technique could be a solution, whereby a few, high-quality data points are queried by searching for the most informative and representative points within the instance space.
