EpsteinBarr virus-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) shows a robust response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, a cost-efficient and accessible tool is needed for discriminating EBV status in patients with gastric cancer. Here we introduce a deep convolutional neural network called EBVNet and its fusion with pathologists for predicting EBVaGC from histopathology. The EBVNet yields an averaged area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.969 from the  Cites: Deep learning-enabled breast cancer hormonal receptor status
