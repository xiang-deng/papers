The rapid development and application of machine learning (ML) techniques in materials science have led to new tools for machine-enabled and autonomous/high-throughput materials design and discovery. Alongside, efforts to extract data from traditional experiments in the published literature with natural language processing (NLP) algorithms provide opportunities to develop tremendous data troves for these in silico design and discovery endeavors. While NLP is used in all aspects of society  Cites: BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
