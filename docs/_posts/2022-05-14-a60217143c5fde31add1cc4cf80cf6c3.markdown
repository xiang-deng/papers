Visual grounding localizes regions (boxes or segments) in the image corresponding to given referring expressions. In this work we address image segmentation from referring expressions, a problem that has so far only been addressed in a fully- supervised setting. A fully-supervised setup, however, requires pixel-wise supervision and is hard to scale given the expense of manual annotation. We therefore introduce a new task of weakly-supervised image segmentation from Cites: Well-read students learn better: The impact of student initialization
