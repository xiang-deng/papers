Abstract Machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming more and more important in cybersecurity, as they can quickly analyse and identify different types of threats from millions of events. In spite of the increasing number of possible applications of machine learning, successful adoption of ML models in cybersecurity still highly relies on the explainability of those models that are used for making predictions. Explanations that support ML model outputs are crucial in cybersecurity‐oriented ML …
