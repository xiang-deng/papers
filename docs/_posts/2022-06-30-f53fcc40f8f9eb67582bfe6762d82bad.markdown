Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used in many important applications, such as computer vision, speaker recognition, natural language processing, etc. Despite their current popular adoptions, DNN models are facing security and efficiency issues when considering their practical use in many critical and resource limited systems. In particular, the vulnerability of DNN models under the adversarial attack, an emerging attack approach that only performs imperceptible Cites: Blockwise Self-Attention for Long Document Understanding
