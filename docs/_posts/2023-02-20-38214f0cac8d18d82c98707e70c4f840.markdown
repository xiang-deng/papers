Recently there are great efforts on leveraging machine learning and logical reasoning. Many approaches start from a given knowledge base, and then try to utilize the knowledge to help machine learning. In real practice, however, the given knowledge base can often be incomplete or even noisy, and thus, it is crucial to develop the ability of knowledge refinement or enhancement. This paper proposes to enable the Abductive learning (ABL) paradigm to have the ability of knowledge  Cites: Introduction to statistical relational learning
