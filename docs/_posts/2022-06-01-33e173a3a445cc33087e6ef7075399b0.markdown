So far, propositional rules have been extracted from Multi Layer Perceptrons to explain how they achieve to classify data. This type of explanation technique is much less prevalent with deep models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we propose to transfer the feature maps generated by a CNN to a simpler neural network model from which propositional rules have been generated. To enable the execution of our rule extraction algorithm in a reasonable time, the  Cites:   Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
