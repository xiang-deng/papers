The ability of an agent to perform well in new and unseen environments is a crucial aspect of intelligence. In machine learning, this ability is referred to as strong or out-of-distribution generalization. However, simply considering differences in data distributions is not sufficient to fully capture differences in environments. In the present paper, we assay out-of-variable generalization, which refers to an agent s ability to handle new situations that involve variables never jointly observed before …
