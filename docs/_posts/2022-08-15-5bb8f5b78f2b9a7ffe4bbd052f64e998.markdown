Construction projects face various constraints in terms of materials, labor, equipment, and documents, which can interrupt the scheduled work. Packagebased constraint management (PCM) is a stateoftheart graphbased approach that follows the lean theory to effectively model, monitor, and remove constraints before the commencement of work, ensuring smooth construction and minimizing delay and waste. PCM relies on exploring and investigating project knowledge bases (KBs) Cites: Multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning with reward shaping
