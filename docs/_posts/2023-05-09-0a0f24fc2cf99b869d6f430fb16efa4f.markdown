Translating natural language queries into SQLs in a seq2seq manner has attracted much attention recently. However, compared with abstract-syntactic-tree-based SQL generation, seq2seq semantic parsers face much more challenges, including poor quality on schematical information prediction and poor semantic coherence between natural language queries and SQLs. This paper analyses the above difficulties and proposes a seq2seq-oriented decoding strategy called SR, which includes a new  Cites: SmBoP: Semi-autoregressive Bottom-up Semantic Parsing
