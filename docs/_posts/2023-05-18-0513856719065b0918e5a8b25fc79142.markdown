Despite the remarkable success of large-scale Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, their performances still significantly underperform fine-tuned models in the task of text classification. This is due to (1) the lack of reasoning ability in addressing complex linguistic phenomena (eg, intensification, contrast, irony etc);(2) limited number of tokens allowed in in-context learning. In this paper, we introduce\textbf {C} lue\textbf {A} nd\textbf {R} easoning\textbf {P} rompting (CARP). CARP adopts a  Cites: Selective annotation makes language models better few-shot
