Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a common diagnostic tool for measuring the seizure activity of the brain. There are many deep learning techniques introduced to analyze EEG. These methods show phenomenal results, although they are limited to computational complexity. Our objective was to develop a novel algorithm that gives maximum classification accuracy with a minor computational complexity. In this view, we have introduced a novel convolutional architecture with an integration of a Cites: Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate
