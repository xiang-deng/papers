With the fast development of Machine Translation (MT) systems, especially the new boost from Neural MT (NMT) models, the MT output quality has reached a new level of accuracy. However, many researchers criticised that the current popular evaluation metrics such as BLEU can not correctly distinguish the state-of-the-art NMT systems regarding quality differences. In this short paper, we describe the design and implementation of a linguistically motivated human-in-the-loop …
