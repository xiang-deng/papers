Deep clustering has achieved great success as its powerful ability to learn effective representation. Especially, graph network clustering has attracted more and more attention. Considering the great success of Graph Autoencoder (GAE) in encoding the graph structure and Deep Autoencoder (DAE) in extracting valuable representations from the data itself, in this paper, we construct an Adversarially regularized Joint Structured Clustering Network (AJSCN) by integrating GAE and Cites: Network Representation Learning with Rich Text Information
