Head pose estimation (HPE) is widely used in attention detection, behavior analysis, and expression recognition. Nevertheless, in some complex scenes (such as facial occlusion, large head deflection angle, and multi-person in one scene), HPE still has the problem of low estimation accuracy. To solve this problem, we propose a dual position feature fusion method for estimating head pose. First, the RGB input is replaced with a standard luminance, which reduces the effect of extraneous light  Cites: Nas-fpn: Learning scalable feature pyramid architecture for object
