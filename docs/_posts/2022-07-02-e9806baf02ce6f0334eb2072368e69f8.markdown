Deep neural models have shown remarkable performance in image recognition tasks, whenever large datasets of labeled images are available. The largest datasets in radiology are available for screening mammography. Recent reports, including in high impact journals, document performance of deep models at or above that of trained radiologists. What is not yet known is whether performance of these trained models is robust and replicates across datasets. Here we evaluate performance of …
