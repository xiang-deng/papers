Compared to other types of interfaces, such as command line interfaces (CLIs) or graphical user interfaces (GUIs), NLIs stand to enable more people to have access to functionality behind databases or APIs as they only require knowledge of natural languages. Many NLI applications involve structured data for the domain (eg, applications such Cites: TaBERT: Pretraining for Joint Understanding of Textual and
