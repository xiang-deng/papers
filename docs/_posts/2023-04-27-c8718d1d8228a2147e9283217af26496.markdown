LDA and pLSA are classical topic modeling methods based on conditional and full probability models, respectively. In addition, the context of a document implies taking the distance between terms in the corpus into account. Information retrieval, topic modeling, and context search can all benefit from the use of probability and distances in quantum mathematics. Through quantum formalism, the projection matrix shows the influence of different parts of the system on each other, taking into …
