Relation extraction (RE) involves identifying the relations between entities from unstructured texts. RE serves as the foundation for many natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as knowledge graph completion, question answering, and information retrieval. In recent years, deep neural networks have dominated the field of RE and made noticeable progress. Subsequently, the large pre-trained language models (PLMs) have taken the state-of-the-art of RE to a new …
