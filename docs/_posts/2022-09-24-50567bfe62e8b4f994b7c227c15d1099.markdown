Using a taxonomy to organize information requires classifying objects (documents, images, etc) with appropriate taxonomic classes. The flexible nature of zero-shot learning is appealing for this task because it allows classifiers to naturally adapt to taxonomy modifications. This work studies zero-shot multi-label document classification with fine-tuned language models under realistic taxonomy expansion scenarios in the human resource domain. Experiments show that zero-shot learning …
