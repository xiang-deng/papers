Chemistry research has both high material and computational costs to conduct experiments. Institutions thus consider chemical data to be valuable and there have been few efforts to construct large public datasets for machine learning. Another challenge is that different intuitions are interested in different classes of molecules, creating heterogeneous data that cannot be easily joined by conventional distributed training. In this work, we introduce federated heterogeneous molecular learning to Cites: Distributionally robust neural networks for group shifts: On the
