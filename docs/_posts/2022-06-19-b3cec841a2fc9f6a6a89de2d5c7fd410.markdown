Automatic summarization methods are efficient but can suffer from low quality. In comparison, manual summarization is expensive but produces higher quality. Can humans and AI collaborate to improve summarization performance? In similar text generation tasks (eg, machine translation), human-AI collaboration in the form of  post-editing  AI-generated text reduces human workload and improves the quality of AI output. Therefore, we explored whether post-editing offers advantages in text
