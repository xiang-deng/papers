While pre-trained language models (LM) for code have achieved great success in code completion, they generate code conditioned only on the contents within the file, ie, in-file context, but ignore the rich semantics in other files within the same project, ie, cross-file context, a critical source of information that is especially useful in modern modular software development. Such overlooking constrains code language models capacity in code completion, leading to unexpected behaviors such as Cites: DocCoder: Generating Code by Retrieving and Reading Docs
