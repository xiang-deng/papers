Extractive summarization aims to produce a concise summary while retaining the key information through the way of selecting sentences from the original document. Under such background, learning inter-sentence relations has hitherto been the issue of most concern. In this study, we propose a Star architecture based model for extractive summarization (StarSum), that takes advantage of self-attention strategy based Transformer and star-shaped structure, models sentences within a document  Cites: Learning-Based Single-Document Summarization with
