Neural abstractive summarization models are able to generate summaries which mimic human references well in fluency. However, summarization models face issues with preserving the factual accuracy of the source document, which is a critical metric in downstream tasks and a major limiting factor of safe realworld applications of these models. One approach is to pipeline a separate factual corrector model (FCM) at the end of some summarization model. The FCM then corrects factual errors Cites: Don t give me the details, just the summary! topic-aware
