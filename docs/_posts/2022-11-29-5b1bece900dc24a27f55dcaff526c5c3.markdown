Deep hypergraph learning receives a surge of interest in recent years. Frameworks commonly used in deep hypergraph learning focus on hypergraphs with edge-independent vertex weights (EIVWs), without considering hypergraphs with edge-dependent vertex weights (EDVWs) which have more modeling power. Moreover, many hypergraph convolutional models are straightforward generalizations of graph convolutional networks by incorporating simple hypergraph Laplacians, which lack …
