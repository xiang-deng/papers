Node representation learning (NRL) has shown incredible success in recent years. It compresses the nodes as low-dimensional vectors, which can accurately represent the characteristics of the nodes. While many researchers have applied NRL to heterogeneous information networks (HIN), most of them only focus on the quality of the node embedding itself or some basic downstream tasks, such as node classification and link prediction. In this thesis, we study the following three problems …
