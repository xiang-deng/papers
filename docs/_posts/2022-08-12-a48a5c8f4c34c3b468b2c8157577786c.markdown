As deep neural networks make significant advances in computer vision tasks, they are being deployed in several high-stakes domains. However, these models are not always semantically meaningful to humans as traditional interpretability techniques are quantitatively driven. Therefore, we explore how to generate saliency maps that are more similar to human attention without significantly sacrificing the model performance. We conduct an empirical study to understand how current object Cites: Finding and fixing spurious patterns with explanations
