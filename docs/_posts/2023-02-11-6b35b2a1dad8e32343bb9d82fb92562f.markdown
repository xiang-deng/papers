The present thesis proposes the integration of interpretable aspects and direct interaction of the system user through feedback in the solution of pattern classification problems based on machine learning methods and the development of neural networks and evolving fuzzy systems. The construction of expert systems based on fuzzy rules should facilitate the interpretation of results. Evolving fuzzy neural network (EFNN) models efficiently aggregate the training capacity of artificial …
