Word-level sign language recognition (SLR) is a significant task which transcribes a sign language video into a word. Currently, deep-learning-based frameworks mostly combine spatial feature extractors based on convolution neural networks (CNNs) and sequence learners. These methods either lack the sufficient capacity to establish the high-level vision semantic knowledge and incorporate the details in images or perform weak intelligence on video frame sequence comprehension.
