摇In entity retrieval tasks, dense vector entity retrieval models are utilized to efficiently filter candidate entities related to a query from a large 鄄scale entity base. However, the existing dense vector retrieval models engender low real 鄄time computation efficiency and large required storage space due to the high dimension of entity vectors. In this paper, it is found that these entity vectors contain a large amount of redundant information through experiments. Most entity vectors are distributed in non …
