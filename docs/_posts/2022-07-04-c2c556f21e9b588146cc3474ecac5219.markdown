Modern facial age estimation systems can achieve high accuracy when training and test datasets are identically distributed and captured under similar conditions. However, domain shifts in data, encountered in practice, lead to a sharp drop in accuracy of most existing age estimation algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel method, namely RAgE, to improve the robustness and reduce the uncertainty of age estimates by leveraging unlabelled data through a subject anchoring strategy and a …
