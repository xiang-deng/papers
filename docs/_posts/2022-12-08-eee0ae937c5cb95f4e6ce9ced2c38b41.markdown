For the reliability assessment of composite materials, the data-driven terahertz nondestructive evaluation (THz NDE) technique has emerged attractive potentials for automatic and intelligent identification of composite damages. Most previous data-drive methods depend on the sufficient labeled damage data and work under the strict assumption that the training data (source domain) and the testing data (target domain) must conform to similar distributions. However, in the actual THz NDE …
