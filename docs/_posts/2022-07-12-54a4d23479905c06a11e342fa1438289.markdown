This paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Grounded Theory for management studies. We argue that this novel and rigorous approach that embeds topic modelling will lead to the latent knowledge to be found. We illustrate this abductive method using 51 case studies of collaborative innovation published by Project Management Institute (PMI). Initial results are presented and discussed that include 40 topics, 6 categories, 4 of which are core categories, and two new theories of project …
