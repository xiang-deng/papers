Over the last decade, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have been widely used in many applications, due to their remarkable performance in various domains. However, the rapid progress in AI and ML driven systems induces new security risks associated with the entire ML pipeline and vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries to attack these systems. Although different defense methods have been proposed to prevent, mitigate, or detect attacks, they are either …
