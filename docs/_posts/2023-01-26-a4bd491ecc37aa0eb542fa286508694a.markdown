A key to knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is to choose a proper representation space, eg, point-wise Euclidean space and complex vector space. In this paper, we propose a unified perspective of embedding and introduce uncertainty into KGE from the view of group theory. Our model can incorporate existing models (ie, generality), ensure the computation is tractable (ie, efficiency) and enjoy the expressive power of complex random variables (ie, expressiveness). The core idea is that we embed  Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
