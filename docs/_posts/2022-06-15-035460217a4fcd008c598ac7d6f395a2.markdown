The rapid detection of ships within the wide sea area is essential for intelligence acquisition. Most modern deep learning-based ship detection methods focus on locating ships in high-resolution (HR) remote sensing (RS) images. Seldom efforts have been made on ship detection in medium-resolution (MR) RS images. An MR image covers a much wider area than an HR one of the same size, thus facilitating quick ship detection. To this end, we propose a tiny ship detection method namely …
