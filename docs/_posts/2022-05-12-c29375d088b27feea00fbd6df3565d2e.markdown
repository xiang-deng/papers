Vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for enabling safety-critical intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications used in management and operations. While there have been some promising advances in the field, there is a need for modern deep learning algorithms that allow real-time trajectory prediction on embedded IoT devices. This article presents DeepTrack, a novel deep learning algorithm customized for real-time vehicle trajectory prediction and monitoring applications in Cites: Empirical evaluation of gated recurrent neural networks on
