Information residing at different levels of security classification cannot be effectively shared across resources that may benefit from the knowledge. We discuss the challenges and potential design choices for building an automated information guard to handle such information across systems or resources with varying authorities. We carry out experiments exemplifying one possible approach, bottom-up modeling, in the text domain, with promising results.  Cites: Recent advances in natural language processing via large pre
