Antimicrobial resistance is a significant public health problem worldwide. In recent years, the scientific community has been intensifying efforts to combat this problem; many experiments have been developed, and many articles are published in this area. However, the growing volume of biological literature increases the difficulty of the biocuration process due to the cost and time required. Modern text mining tools with the adoption of artificial intelligence technology are helpful to assist in the Cites: Combining heterogeneous models for measuring relational similarity
