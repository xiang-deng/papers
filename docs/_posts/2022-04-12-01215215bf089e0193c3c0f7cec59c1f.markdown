The increasing number of questions on Question Answering (QA) platforms like Math Stack Exchange (MSE) signifies a growing information need to answer math-related questions. However, there is currently very little research on approaches for an open data QA system that retrieves mathematical formulae using their concept names or querying formula identifier relationships from knowledge graphs. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap by presenting data mining methods and benchmark results to Cites: SemEval-2019 task 10: math question answering
