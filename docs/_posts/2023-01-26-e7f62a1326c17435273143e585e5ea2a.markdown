In recent years, with the rapid development of key elements and core technologies of artificial intelligence, large-scale pre-training model (large model) has achieved remarkable effects. As specific practice progresses of large model, it is useful to realize the universality and generalizability of artificial intelligence, and respond to the strategic goal of building a strong model framework. From the perspective of theory, this article explores the support points of large model in the theories of Cites: Delta Tuning: A Comprehensive Study of Parameter Efficient
