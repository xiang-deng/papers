Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been demonstrated to be effective in pre-training models that can be generalized to various downstream tasks. Graph Autoencoder (GAE), an increasingly popular SSL approach on graphs, has been widely explored to learn node representations without ground-truth labels. However, recent studies show that existing GAE methods could only perform well on link prediction tasks, while their performance on classification tasks is rather limited. This limitation casts …
