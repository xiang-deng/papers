Recent advances in deep learning have brought remarkable performance improvements in named entity recognition (NER), specifically in token-level classification problems. However, deep learning models often require a large amount of annotated data to achieve satisfactory performance, and NER annotation is significantly time-consuming and labor-intensive due to the fine-grained labels. To address this issue, we propose a textual data augmentation method that can Cites: Leveraging 2-hop Distant Supervision from Table Entity Pairs for
