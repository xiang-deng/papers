Integer Linear Programming (ILP) provides a viable mechanism to encode explicit and controllable assumptions about explainable multi-hop inference with natural language. However, an ILP formulation is non-differentiable and cannot be integrated into broader deep learning architectures. Recently, Thayaparan et al.(2021a) proposed a novel methodology to integrate ILP with Transformers to achieve end-to-end differentiability for complex multi-hop inference.
