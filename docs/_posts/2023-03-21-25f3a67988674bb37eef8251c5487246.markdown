Coreference resolution models are often evaluated on multiple datasets. Datasets vary, however, in how coreference is realized--ie, how the theoretical concept of coreference is operationalized in the dataset--due to factors such as the choice of corpora and annotation guidelines. We investigate the extent to which errors of current coreference resolution models are associated with existing differences in operationalization across datasets (OntoNotes, PreCo, and Winogrande) …
