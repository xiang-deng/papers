The capability of effectively quantifying the uncertainty associated to a given prediction is an important task in many applications that range from drug design to autonomous driving, providing valuable information to many downstream decision-making processes. The increasing capacity of novel machine learning models, and the growing amount of data on which these systems are trained poses however significant issues to be addressed. Recent research advocated the need for Cites: Green AI
