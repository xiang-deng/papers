Recent state-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained from natural language supervision, ranging from simple object category names to descriptive captions. This free form of supervision ensures high generality and usability of the learned visual models, based on extensive heuristics on data collection to cover as many visual concepts as possible. Alternatively, learning with external knowledge about images is a promising way which leverages a much more structured source of supervision.
