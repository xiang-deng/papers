Abstract k NN-MT has been recently proposed, uses a token-level k-nearest neighbor approach to retrieve similar sentences, obtaining knowledge guidance from an external memory module, and then combined with the prediction results of the translation model, which greatly improves the accuracy of machine translation. However, k NN-MT uses simple linear interpolation in the fusion of retrieval probability and translation probability, which can not dynamically adjust the fusion  Cites: Nearest neighbor machine translation
