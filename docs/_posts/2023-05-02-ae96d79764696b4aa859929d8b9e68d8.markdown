Multi-hop reasoning, a prevalent approach for query answering, aims at inferring new facts along reasonable paths over a knowledge graph. Reinforcement learning methods can be adopted by formulating the problem into a Markov decision process. However, common suffering within RL-based reasoning models is that the agent can be biased to spurious paths which coincidentally lead to the correct answer with poor explanation. In this work, we take a deep dive into this phenomenon and define a …
