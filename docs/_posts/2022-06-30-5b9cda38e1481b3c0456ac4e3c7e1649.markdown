Objectives To estimate the probability of malignancy of an oral leukoplakia lesion using Deep Learning, in terms of evolution to cancer and high-risk dysplasia. Materials and Methods A total of 261 oral leukoplakia lesions with a mean of 5.5 years follow-up were analysed from standard digital photographs. A deep learning pipeline composed by a U-Net based segmentation of the lesion followed by a multi-task CNN classifier was used to predict the malignant transformation and the risk of …
