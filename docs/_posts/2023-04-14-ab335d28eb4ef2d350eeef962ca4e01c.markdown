We demonstrate the potential of the state-of-the-art OpenAI GPT-4 large language model to engage in meaningful interactions with Astronomy papers using in-context prompting. To optimize for efficiency, we employ a distillation technique that effectively reduces the size of the original input paper by 50\%, while maintaining the paragraph structure and overall semantic integrity. We then explore the model s responses using a multi-document context (ten distilled documents). Our findings …
