Dependency-based approaches to syntactic analysis assume that syntactic structure can be analyzed in terms of binary asymmetric dependency relations holding between elementary syntactic units. Computational models for dependency parsing almost universally assume that an elementary syntactic unit is a word, while the influential theory of Lucien Tesnire instead posits a more abstract notion of nucleus, which may be realized as one or more words. In this article, we investigate the effect Cites: Designing and interpreting probes with control tasks
