Text classification techniques have been substantially important to many smart computing applications, eg topic extraction and event detection. However, classification is always challenging when only insufficient amount of labelled data for model training is available. To mitigate this issue, zero-shot learning (ZSL) has been introduced for models to recognise new classes that have not been observed during the training stage. We propose an entailment-based zero-shot text classification Cites: Benchmarking zero-shot text classification: Datasets, evaluation
