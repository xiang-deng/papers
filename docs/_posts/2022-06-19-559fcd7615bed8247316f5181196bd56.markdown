Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have a strong ability to learn graph representation and have achieved good performance in a range of applications, including social relationship analysis, biological information processing, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and so on. In recent years, the application of GCNs in natural language processing and computer vision has attracted substantial interest from researchers, as a result of which many studies …
