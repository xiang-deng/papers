Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) requires not only a high-precision reader, but also high-quality retrieval of related passages. Particularly, real-world OpenQA usually involves multi-hop retrieval and reading to deal with complex questions that need bridging information. In this paper, we investigate the mutual promotion of dense retrievers and Graph Neural Network-based readers to improve OpenQA. Specifically, we introduce an alternate training strategy where the scores of Cites: Retrieve, rerank, read, then iterate: Answering open-domain
