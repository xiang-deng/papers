In this paper we introduce Detect, Understand, Act (DUA), a neuro-symbolic reinforcement learning framework. The Detect component is composed of a traditional computer vision object detector and tracker. The Act component houses a set of options, high-level actions enacted by pre-trained deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. The Understand component provides a novel answer set programming (ASP) paradigm for symbolically implementing a meta-policy over Cites: Neural logic machines
