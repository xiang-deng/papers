Natural-language-to-code models learn to generate a code snippet given a natural language (NL) intent. However, the rapid growth of both publicly available and proprietary libraries and functions makes it impossible to cover all APIs using training examples, as new libraries and functions are introduced daily. Thus, existing models inherently cannot generalize to using unseen functions and libraries merely through incorporating them into the training data. In contrast, when human programmers write …
