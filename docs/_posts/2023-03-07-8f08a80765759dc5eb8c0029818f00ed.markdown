We present a novel framework for uncertain data management. We start with a database whose tuple correctness is uncertain and an oracle that can resolve the uncertainty, ie, decide if a tuple is correct or not.

We wish to use the oracle to clean the database with the goal of ensuring the correct answer for specific mission-critical queries. To avoid the prohibitive cost of cleaning the entire database and to minimize Cites: Databases with uncertainty and lineage
