Word in context (WiC) task aims to determine whether a target word s occurrences in two sentences share the same sense. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive Learning WiC (CLWiC) framework to improve the learning of sentence/word representations and classification of target word senses in the sentence pair when performing WiC on lowresource languages. In representation learning, CLWiC trains a pre-trained language model s ability to cope with lowresource languages using  Cites: Phrase-bert: Improved phrase embeddings from bert with an
