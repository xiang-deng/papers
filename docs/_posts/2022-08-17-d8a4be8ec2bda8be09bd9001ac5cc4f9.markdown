Knowledge graph reasoning plays a pivotal role in many real-world applications, such as network alignment, computational fact-checking, recommendation, and many more. Among these applications, knowledge graph completion (KGC) and multi-hop question answering over knowledge graph (Multi-hop KGQA) are two representative reasoning tasks. In the vast majority of the existing works, the two tasks are considered separately with different models or algorithms. However, we Cites: Complex embeddings for simple link prediction
