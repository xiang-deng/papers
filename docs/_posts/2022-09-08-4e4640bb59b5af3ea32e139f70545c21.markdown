This chapter provides an overview of machine learning models and their applications to the science of inland waters. Such models serve a wide range of purposes for science and management: predicting water quality, quantity, or ecological dynamics across space, time, or hypothetical scenarios; vetting and distilling raw data for further modeling or analysis; generating and exploring hypotheses; estimating physically or biologically meaningful parameters for use in further modeling; and Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
