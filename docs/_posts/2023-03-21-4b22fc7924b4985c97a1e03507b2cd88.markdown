As AI systems mediate more of our interactions with the world, it is important to understand the degree to which AI systems might manipulate humans\textit {without the intent of the system designers}. Our work clarifies challenges in defining and measuring manipulation in the context of AI systems. Firstly, we build upon prior literature on manipulation from other fields and  Cites: Evaluating Explainable AI: Which Algorithmic Explanations Help
