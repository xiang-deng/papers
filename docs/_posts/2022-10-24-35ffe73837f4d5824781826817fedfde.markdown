Decision trees have long been recognized as models of choice in sensitive applications where interpretability is of paramount importance. In this paper, we examine the computational ability of Boolean decision trees for the explanation purpose. We focus on both abductive explanations (suited to explaining why a given instance has been classified as such by the decision tree at hand) and on contrastive explanations (suited to explaining why a given instance has not been classified by  Cites: Intelligible and explainable machine learning: best practices and
