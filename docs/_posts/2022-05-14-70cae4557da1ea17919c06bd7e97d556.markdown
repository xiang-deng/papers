Considerable progress has been made recently in open-domain question answering (QA) problems, which require Information Retrieval (IR) and Reading Comprehension (RC). A popular approach to improve the system s performance is to improve the quality of the retrieved context from the IR stage. In this work we show that for StrategyQA, a challenging open-domain QA dataset that requires multi-hop reasoning, this common approach is surprisingly ineffective--improving the quality of Cites: Answering Open-Domain Questions of Varying Reasoning Steps
