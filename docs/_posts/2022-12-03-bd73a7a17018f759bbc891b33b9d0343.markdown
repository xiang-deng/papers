Sentiment transfer involves changing the sentiment of a sentence, such as from a positive to negative sentiment, while maintaining the informational content. Given the dearth of parallel corpora in this domain, sentiment transfer and other text rewriting tasks have been posed as unsupervised learning problems. In this paper we propose a self-supervised approach to sentiment or text style transfer. First, sentiment words are identified through an interpretable text classifier based on the  Cites: A Probabilistic Formulation of Unsupervised Text Style Transfer
