Obtaining the surface temperature of billets in heating furnaces has been a hot research in metallurgical industry applications. In order to accurately identify the billet location in infrared images and thus obtain the surface temperature of billets, this paper proposes a real-time segmentation network model based on multi-scale feature fusion to solve the problems of low resolution, low accuracy and slow detection speed of infrared images of traditional target image detection methods.
