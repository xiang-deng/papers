Recent work has shown that deep learning models in NLP are highly sensitive to low- level correlations between simple features and specific output labels, leading to overfitting and lack of generalization. To mitigate this problem, a common practice is to balance datasets by adding new instances or by filtering out  easy  instances (Sakaguchi et al., 2020), culminating in a recent proposal to eliminate single-word correlations altogether (Gardner et al., 2021). In this opinion paper, we identify that Cites: Adversarial filters of dataset biases
