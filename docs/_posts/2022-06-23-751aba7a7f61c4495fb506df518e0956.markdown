The notion of fairness in machine learning has gained significant popularity in the last decades, in part due to the large number of decision-making models that are being deployed on real-world applications, which have presented unwanted behavior. In this work, we analyze fairness in machine learning from a multi-objective optimization perspective, where the goal is to learn a model that achieves a good performance across different groups or demographics. In particular, we analyze how  Cites: Distributionally robust neural networks for group shifts: On the
