In a previous paper, we proposed an algorithm for ontologydriven conceptual model abstractions [18]. We have implemented and tested this algorithm over a FAIR Catalog of such models represented in the OntoUML language. This provided evidence for the correctness of the algorithm s implementation, ie, that it correctly implements the model transformation rules prescribed by the algorithm, and its effectiveness, ie, it is able to achieve high compression (summarization) rates over  Cites: Does the whole exceed its parts? the effect of ai explanations on
