Fine-grained sentiment classification (FGSC) task and fine-grained controllable text generation (FGSG) task are two representative applications of sentiment analysis, two of which together can actually form an inverse task prediction, ie, the former aims to infer the fine-grained sentiment polarities given a text piece, while the latter generates text content that describes the input fine-grained opinions. Most of the existing work solves the FGSC and the FGSG tasks in isolation, while ignoring the  Cites: Adaptive recursive neural network for target-dependent twitter
