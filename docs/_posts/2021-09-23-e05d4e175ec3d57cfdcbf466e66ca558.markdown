Representing time-series without relying on the domain knowledge and independent of the end-task is a challenging problem. The same situation applies to trajectory data as well, where sufficient labelled information is often unavailable to learn effective representations. This thesis addresses this problem and explores unsupervised ways of representing the temporal data. The novel methods imitate the human visual perception of the pictorial depiction of such data based on deep Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
