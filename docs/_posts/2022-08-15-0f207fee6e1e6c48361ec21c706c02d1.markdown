This paper describes the design and implementation of a new machine learning model for online learning systems. We aim at improving the intelligent level of the systems by enabling an automated math word problem solver which can support a wide range of functions such as homework correction, difficulty estimation, and priority recommendation. We originally planned to employ existing models but realized that they processed a math word problem as a sequence or a homogeneous Cites: Mapping to declarative knowledge for word problem solving
