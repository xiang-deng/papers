The automatic generation of computer programs is one of the main applications with practical relevance in the field of evolutionary computation. With program synthesis techniques not only software developers could be supported in their everyday work but even users without any programming knowledge could be empowered to automate repetitive tasks and implement their own new functionality. In recent years, many novel program synthesis approaches based on evolutionary algorithms have Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
