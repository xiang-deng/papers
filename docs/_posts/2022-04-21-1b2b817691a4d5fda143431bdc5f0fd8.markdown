Understanding genotypephenotype relationships is one of the most important areas of research in agronomy. The new challenges aim at understanding these relationships on the level of the different molecular entities responsible for the expression of complex phenotypic traits. Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have resulted in tremendous increase in the amount of data in the agronomic domain. Unfortunately, they can only partially capture these dynamics.
