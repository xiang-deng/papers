Source code summarisation is a vital tool for the understanding and maintenance of source code as summarisations can be used to explain code in simple terms. However, source code with missing, incorrect, or outdated summaries is a common occurrence in production code. Automatic source code summarisation seeks to solve these issues by generating up-to-date summaries of source code methods. Recent work in automatically generating source code summaries uses neural networks for  Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
