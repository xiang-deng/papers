We study the problem of decomposing a complex text-to-sql task into smaller sub-tasks and how such a decomposition can significantly improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the reasoning process. There is currently a significant gap between the performance of fine-tuned models and prompting approaches using LLMs on challenging text-to-sql datasets such as Spider. We show that SQL queries, despite their declarative structure, can be broken down into sub Cites: Xi Victoria Lin, Bailin Wang, Yi Chern Tan, Xinyi Yang, Dragomir
