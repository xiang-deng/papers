Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) is an emerging research spot aimed at inexpensively adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Recent advances have achieved great success in saving storage costs for various vision tasks by updating or injecting a small number of parameters instead of full fine-tuning. However, we notice that most existing PETL methods still incur non-negligible latency during inference. In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient and Cites: VL-Adapter: Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for Vision-and
