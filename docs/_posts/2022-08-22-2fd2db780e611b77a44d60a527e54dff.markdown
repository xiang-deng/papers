Fake news can be propagated quickly across online microblogs, resulting in a series of adverse impacts on our daily lives. Traditional fake news detection models focus on incorporating writing styles, or world knowledge (eg, triples). Nevertheless, writing styles are easy to imitate. Different from world knowledge, in this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical language knowledge-driven fake news detection (HLKFND) framework. More specifically, we first conduct entity linking to obtain the entity words Cites: Compare to the knowledge: Graph neural fake news detection with
