Regional seismic networks often observe artificially induced seismic events such as blasting and collapses. Misclassified seismic events in the earthquake catalog can therefore interfere with assessments of natural seismic activity. Traditional methods rely on the period, and phase features of seismic waves to determine the nature of seismic events. We designed three seismic event classifiers with reference to convolutional neural network structures such as VGGnet, ResNet, and Inception. The  Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
