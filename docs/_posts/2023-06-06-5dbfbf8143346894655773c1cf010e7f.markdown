Temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) aims to learn the embedding of entities and relations in a temporal knowledge graph (TKG). Although the previous graph neural networks (GNN) based models have achieved promising results, they cannot directly capture the interactions of multi-facts at different timestamps. To address the above limitation, we propose a time-aware relational graph attention model (TARGAT), which takes the multi-facts at different timestamps as a unified …
