Operational optimisation is one of the most important methods for reducing energy consumption and emissions related to ships. In this study, a speed-trim joint optimisation method is proposed. First, the propulsion power for various operating conditions was estimated by numerical simulation, two-dimensional method, and ship-engine-propeller principle. Second, the obtained data, consisting of ship power, draft, trim angle, and speed, were further expanded to form a joint optimisation Cites: Machine learning and databases: The sound of things to come or a
