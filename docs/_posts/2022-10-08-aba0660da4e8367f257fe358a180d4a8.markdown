Optimizing strategic decisions (aka computing equilibrium) is key to the success of many non-cooperative multi-agent applications. However, in many real-world situations, we may face the exact opposite of this game-theoretic problem--instead of prescribing equilibrium of a given game, we may directly observe the agents equilibrium behaviors but want to infer the underlying parameters of an unknown game. This research question, also known as inverse game theory, has been studied Cites: The ai economist: Improving equality and productivity with ai
