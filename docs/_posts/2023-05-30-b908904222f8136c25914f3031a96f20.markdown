Open-world survival games pose significant challenges for AI algorithms due to their multi-tasking, deep exploration, and goal prioritization requirements. Despite reinforcement learning (RL) being popular for solving games, its high sample complexity limits its effectiveness in complex open-world games like Crafter or Minecraft. We propose a novel approach, SPRING, to read the game s original academic paper and use the knowledge learned to reason and play the game Cites: SILG: The Multi-domain Symbolic Interactive Language Grounding
