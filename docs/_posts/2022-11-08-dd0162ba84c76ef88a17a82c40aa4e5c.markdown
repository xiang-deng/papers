It is a great challenge for traditional offline detectors to learn from continuous data streams, remember previous tasks and adapt to new-coming tasks in dynamic environments. To meet the challenge, online continual learning has recently attracted increasing attention, while the overwhelming majority of works focus only on classification with a balanced class distribution assumption. In this paper, we propose a replay-based approach called an online continual object detector (OCOD) Cites: Simple copy-paste is a strong data augmentation method for
