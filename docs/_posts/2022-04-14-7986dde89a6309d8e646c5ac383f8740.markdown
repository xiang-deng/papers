Adversarial training (AT) is a typical method to learn adversarially robust deep neural networks via training on the adversarial variants generated by their natural examples. However, as training progresses, the training data becomes less attackable, which may undermine the enhancement of model robustness. A straightforward remedy is to incorporate more training data, but it may incur an unaffordable cost. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we propose a deCisiOn Cites: Unlabeled data improves adversarial robustness
