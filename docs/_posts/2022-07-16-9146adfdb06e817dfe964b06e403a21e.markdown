Abstract Conversational Question Answering (ConvQA) is required to answer the current question, conditioned on the observable paragraph-level context and conversation history.

It yielded significant improvement compared to history-independent reasoning. This paper further strengthens the ConvQA encoder by Cites: Attentive History Selection for Conversational Question Answering
