A hyper-relational knowledge graph has been recently studied where a triplet is associated with a set of qualifiers; a qualifier is composed of a relation and an entity, providing auxiliary information for a triplet. While existing hyper-relational knowledge graph embedding methods assume that the entities are discrete objects, some information should be represented using numeric values, eg,(JRR, was born in, 1892). Also, a triplet (JRR, educated at, Oxford Univ.) can be associated with a Cites: Smore: Knowledge graph completion and multi-hop reasoning in
