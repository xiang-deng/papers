Logical reasoning is essential in a variety of human activities. A representative example of a logical task is mathematics. Recent large-scale models trained on large datasets have been successful in various fields, but their reasoning ability in arithmetic tasks is limited, which we reproduce experimentally. Here, we recast this limitation as not unique to mathematics but common to tasks that require logical operations. We then propose a new set of tasks, termed logical tasks, which will be  Cites: Emergent abilities of large language models
