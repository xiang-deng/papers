This white paper presents the vision of a novel methodology for developing safety-critical software, which is inspired by late developments in learning based co-piloting of implementations. The methodology, called TriCo, integrates formal methods with learning based approaches to co-pilot the agile, simultaneous development of three artefacts: implementation, specification, and tests. Whenever the user changes any of these, a TriCo empowered IDE would suggest changes to the other two artefacts in Cites: Program Synthesis with Large Language Models.(2021)
