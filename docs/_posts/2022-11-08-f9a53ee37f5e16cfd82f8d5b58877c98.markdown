To greatly support the assessment of food safety situation, Question Answering (QA) system could effectively extract correct answer from web-scale information with the relevant questions. However, most of the existing QA systems are constructed on the searching methods, which cannot deal with the questions that needs multi-hop (multi steps) reasoning process. Meanwhile, black-box models like neural networks are the base of most existing QA systems, resulting in weak interpretability and low …
