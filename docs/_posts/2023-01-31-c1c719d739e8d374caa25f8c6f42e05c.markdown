High-affinity antibodies are often identified through directed evolution, which may require many iterations of mutagenesis and selection to find an optimal candidate. Deep learning techniques hold the potential to accelerate this process but the existing methods cannot provide the confidence interval or uncertainty needed to assess the reliability of the predictions. Here we present a pipeline called RESP for efficient identification of high affinity antibodies. We develop a learned representation  Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
