Abstract Model counting (# SAT) asks to compute the number of satisfying assignments for a propositional formula. The decision version (SAT) received widespread interest in computational complexity, formed many applications in modern combinatorial problem solving, and can be solved effectively for millions of variables on structured instances.# SAT is much harder than SAT and requires more elaborate solving techniques. We revisit the problem, its complexity, and explain …
