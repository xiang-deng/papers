Decision trees are powerful tools for classification and regression that attract many researchers working in the burgeoning area of machine learning. One advantage of decision trees over other methods is their interpretability, which is often preferred over other higher accuracy methods that are relatively uninterpretable. A binary classification tree has two types of vertices:(i) branching vertices which have exactly two children and where datapoints are assessed on a set of discrete features; and (ii) Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
