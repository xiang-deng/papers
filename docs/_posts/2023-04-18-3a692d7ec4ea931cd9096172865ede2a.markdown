This paper presents a new Human-steerable Topic Modeling (HSTM) technique. Unlike existing techniques commonly relying on matrix decomposition-based topic models, we extend LDA as the fundamental component for extracting topics. LDA s high popularity and technical characteristics, such as better topic quality and no need to cherry-pick terms to construct the document-term matrix, ensure better applicability. Our research revolves around two inherent limitations of LDA. First, the …
