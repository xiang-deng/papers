Research into the detection, classification, and prediction of internal defects using surface morphology data of parts created via powder bed fusion-type additive manufacturing has become a hot topic in the previous decade thanks to the development of deep learning. However, there is no other evidence to evaluate the model other than accuracy and metrics. In this paper, a novel data set is compiled from various literature and other sources to evaluate the black box model using …
