Building systems that can understand and represent visual semantic knowledge is one of the fundamental problems towards artificial general intelligence. Much of the previous work on visual semantic understanding has used visual semantic embedding (VSE) to align well-represented visual features and language features. However, these techniques are insufficient to generalize beyond the data they have seen during training. In this thesis, we initially revisit the hierarchy of levels between …
