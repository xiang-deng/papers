In large software-intensive organizations, trouble reports (TRs) are heavily involved in reporting, analyzing, and resolving faults. Due to the scale of modern organizations and products, multiple people independently often identify faults, leading to duplicate TRs. To mitigate the additional manual effort to identify and resolve these duplicate TRs, prior work at Ericsson focused on developing a 2-stage BERT-based retrieval system for identifying similar TRs when provided a new fault  Cites: Dense passage retrieval for open-domain question answering
