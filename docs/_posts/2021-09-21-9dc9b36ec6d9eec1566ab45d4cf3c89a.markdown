This analysis compares and contrasts a variety of methods for assessing emotions in Twitter data. Deep learning (DL) methods have gained momentum in this field among academics, who collaborate on a level playing field to tackle a wide variety of problems. CNNs, which are used to locate pictures, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which may be utilized successfully in natural language processing (NLP), are two types of neural networks. For this reason, two types of neural networks are Cites: Document modeling with gated recurrent neural network for
