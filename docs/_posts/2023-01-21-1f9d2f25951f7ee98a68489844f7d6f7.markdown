Word embeddings are a fundamental tool in natural language processing. Currently, word embedding methods are evaluated on the basis of empirical performance on benchmark data sets, and there is a lack of rigorous understanding of their theoretical properties. This paper studies word embeddings from a statistical theoretical perspective, which is essential for formal inference and uncertainty quantification. We propose a copula-based statistical model for text data and show …
