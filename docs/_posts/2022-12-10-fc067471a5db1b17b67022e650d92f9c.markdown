Multi-label text classification (MLTC) has a wide range of real-world applications. Neural networks recently promoted the performance of MLTC models. Training these neural-network models relies on sufficient accurately labelled data. However, manually annotating large-scale multi-label text classification datasets is expensive and impractical for many applications. Weak supervision techniques have thus been developed to reduce the cost of annotating text corpus. However, these techniques …
