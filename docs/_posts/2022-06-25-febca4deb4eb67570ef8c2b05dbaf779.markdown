Artificial intelligence and machine learning are ubiquitous in the domain of Earth Observation (EO) and Remote Sensing. Congruent to their success in the domain of computer vision, they have proven to obtain high accuracies for EO applications. Yet experts of EO should also consider the weaknesses of complex, machine-learning models before adopting them for specific applications. One such weakness is the lack of explainability of complex deep learning models. This paper reviews published Cites: " Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any
