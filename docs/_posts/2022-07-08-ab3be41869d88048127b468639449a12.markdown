Neural networks are typically represented as data structures that are traversed either through iteration or by manual chaining of method calls. However, a deeper analysis reveals that structured recursion can be used instead, so that traversal is directed by the structure of the network itself. This paper shows how such an approach can be realised in Haskell, by encoding neural networks as recursive data types, and then their training as recursion scheme patterns. In turn, we promote a coherent  Cites: Semantic parsing for single-relation question answering
