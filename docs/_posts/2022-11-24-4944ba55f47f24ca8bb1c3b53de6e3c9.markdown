2 underutilized and the correlation between samples is not considered. 2. Lack of the ability to memorize large and complex structures, so that complex codes cannot be generated correctly. To this end, we propose HRCODE model, a code generation architecture based on Hybrid of structural and semantic features Retrieval CODE model. We transform the natural language description into an intermediate structure with structural features. Then, the NL and the intermediate structure are embedded …
