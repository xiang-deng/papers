Zero-shot entity retrieval, aiming to link mentions to candidate entities under the zero-shot setting, is vital for many tasks in Natural Language Processing. Most existing methods represent mentions/entities via the sentence embeddings of corresponding context from the Pre-trained Language Model. However, we argue that such coarse-grained sentence embeddings can not fully model the mentions/entities, especially when the attention scores towards mentions/entities are relatively low.
