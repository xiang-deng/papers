Recent years have shown that deep learning models pre-trained on large text corpora using the language model objective can help solve various tasks requiring natural language understanding. However, many commonsense concepts are underrepresented in online resources because they are too obvious for most humans. To solve this problem, we propose the use of affordancescommon-sense knowledge that can be injected into models to increase their ability to understand our  Cites: Unicorn on rainbow: A universal commonsense reasoning model
