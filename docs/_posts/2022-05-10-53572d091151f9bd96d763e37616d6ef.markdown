Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) is one of the most challenging yet widely investigated problems in natural language processing. It aims at building a system that can answer any given question from large-scale unstructured text or structured knowledge-base. To solve this problem, researchers traditionally use information retrieval methods to retrieve the most relevant documents and then use answer extractions techniques to extract the answer or passage from the candidate Cites: Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering
