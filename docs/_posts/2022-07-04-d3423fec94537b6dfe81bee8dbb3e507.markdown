To achieve lifelong language learning, pseudo-rehearsal methods leverage samples generated from a language model to refresh the knowledge of previously learned tasks. Without proper controls, however, these methods could fail to retain the knowledge of complex tasks with longer texts since most of the generated samples are low in quality. To overcome the problem, we propose three specific contributions. First, we utilize double language models, each of which specializes on a specific part Cites: Fact or fiction: Verifying scientific claims
