Liquid–vapor phase change phenomena such as boiling and condensation are processes widely implemented in industrial systems such as power plants, refrigeration and air conditioning systems, desalination plants, water processing installations and thermal management devices due to their enhanced heat transfer capability when compared to single-phase processes. The last decade has seen significant advances in the development and application of micro and nanostructured …
