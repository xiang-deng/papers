Ever-growing demand for artificial intelligence has motivated research on unconventional computation based on physical devices. While such computation devices mimic brain-inspired analog information processing, the learning procedures still rely on methods optimized for digital processing such as backpropagation, which is not suitable for physical implementation. Here, we present physical deep learning by extending a biologically inspired training algorithm called direct feedback  Cites: On the Number of Linear Regions of Deep Neural Networks
