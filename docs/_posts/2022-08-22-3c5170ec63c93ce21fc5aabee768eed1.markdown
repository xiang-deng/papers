Objective: Extracting reliable information from EEG signals is difficult because the low signal-to-noise ratio and significant intersubject variability seriously hinder statistical analyses. However, recent advances in explainable machine learning open a new strategy to address this problem. Approach: The current study evaluates this approach using results from the classification and decoding of electrical brain activity associated with information retention. We designed four neural network Cites: Pay attention to mlps
