Aspect-based sentiment classification task aims at discovering the sentiment polarity on a specific aspect term. Since a sentence often contains several sentiments for different aspects, it is very important to capture the correspondences between aspects and opinion words in a sentence. To this end, we propose an aspect opinion interactive attention routing network model, which adopts an interactive attention mechanism between specific aspect embeddings learned from graph convolutional  Cites: RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach
