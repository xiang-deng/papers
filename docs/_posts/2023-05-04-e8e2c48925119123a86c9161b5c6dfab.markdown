Fatigue is a process of mechanical degradation that is usually assessed based on empirical rules and experimental data obtained from standardized tests. Fatigue data of engineering materials are commonly reported in SN (the stress-life relation), -N (the strain-life relation), and da/dN-K (the relation between the fatigue crack growth rate and the stress intensity factor range) data. Fatigue and static mechanical properties of additively manufactured (AM) alloys, as well as the types of materials Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
