Semi-supervised learning is the learning setting in which we have both labeled and unlabeled data at our disposal. This survey covers theoretical results for this setting and maps out the benefits of unlabeled data in classification and regression tasks. Most methods that use unlabeled data rely on certain assumptions about the data distribution. When those assumptions are not met, including unlabeled data may actually decrease performance. For all practical purposes, it is therefore instructive to Cites: Unlabeled data improves adversarial robustness
