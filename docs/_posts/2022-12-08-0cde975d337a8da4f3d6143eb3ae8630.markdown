We investigate the feasibility of machine learning methods for attributional content and framing analysis in corporate reporting. We test the performance of five widely-used supervised machine learning classifiers (nave Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, decision trees) in a top-down three-level hierarchical setting to (1) identify performance-related statements;(2) detect attributions in these; and (3) classify the content of the attributional statements.
