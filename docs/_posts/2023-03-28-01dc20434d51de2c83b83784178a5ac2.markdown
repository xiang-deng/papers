The rapid development of deep learning provides great convenience for production and life. However, the massive labels required for training models limits further development. Few-shot learning which can obtain a high-performance model by learning few samples in new tasks, providing a solution for many scenarios that lack samples. This paper summarizes few-shot learning algorithms in recent years and proposes a taxonomy. Firstly, we introduce the few-shot learning task and its  Cites: Hybrid attention-based prototypical networks for noisy few-shot
