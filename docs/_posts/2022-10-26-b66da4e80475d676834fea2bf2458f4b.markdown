Large Language Model (LLM) trained on the mixture of text and code has demonstrated impressive capability in translating natural language (NL) into structured code. In this work, we propose Code4Struct to leverage such text-to-structure translation capability to tackle structured prediction tasks in NLP. For example, Event Argument Extraction (EAE) aims to convert text into event-argument structures that can be represented as a class object using code.
