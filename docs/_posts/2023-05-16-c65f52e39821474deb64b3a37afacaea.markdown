Abstract\noindent Over the past decade, machine visual perception has experienced remarkable progress due to advancements in the field of deep learning. However, the performance of deep learning systems remain far from ideal in real-world tasks that lack large training datasets. In this thesis, we study learning under limited supervision with a focus on unsupervised domain adaptation (no labelled examples) and few-shot learning (few labelled examples). We propose adaptation schemes that …
