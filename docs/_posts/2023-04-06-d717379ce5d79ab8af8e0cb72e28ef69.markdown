In recent years, Natural Language Generation (NLG) techniques in AI (eg, T5, GPT-3, ChatGPT) have shown a massive improvement and are now capable of generating human-like long coherent texts at scale, yielding so-called deepfake texts. This advancement, despite their benefits, can also cause security and privacy issues (eg, plagiarism, identity obfuscation, disinformation attack). As such, it has become critically important to develop effective, practical, and scalable solutions to Cites: Scarecrow: A framework for scrutinizing machine text
