Zero-shot knowledge graph (KG) has gained much research attention in recent years. Due to its excellent performance in approximating data distribution, generative adversarial network (GAN) has been used in zero-shot learning for KG completion. However, existing works on GAN-based zero-shot KG completion all use traditional simple architecture without randomness in generator, which greatly limits the ability of GAN mining knowledge on complex datasets. Moreover, the discriminator not only Cites: Never-ending learning
