The sustainable production of chemicals from renewable, nonedible biomass has emerged as an essential alternative to address pressing environmental issues arising from our heavy dependence on fossil resources. Microbial cell factories are engineered microorganisms harboring biosynthetic pathways streamlined to produce chemicals of interests from renewable carbon sources. The biosynthetic pathways for the production of chemicals can be defined into three categories with reference to the Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
