Automatic extraction of surface water is of great significance to the study of the global water cycle and the dynamic management of water resources. At present, the water extraction accuracy of high-resolution multi-spectral remote sensing images has been greatly improved. But it is still affected by the shadow of the mountains and the shadow of the tall buildings inside the city. The spectral information of shadow is basically consistent with the spectral information of water, so the accuracy of any  Cites: Efficientnetv2: Smaller models and faster training
