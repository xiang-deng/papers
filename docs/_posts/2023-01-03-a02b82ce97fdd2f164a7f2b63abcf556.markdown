Crossdomain sentiment classification is a significant task of sentiment analysis that objectives to predict the opinion orientation of text documents in the target domain by using the source domain s learned classifier. Most of the existing approaches of domainadaptation in sentiment classification focus on sharing lowdimensional features across the domain using domain independent and specific features to mitigate the gap between domains.
