Conversational agents are getting more popular and applied in a wide range of practical application areas. The main task of these agents is not only to generate context-appropriate responses to a given query but also to make the conversation human-like. Thanks to the ability of deep learning based models in natural language modeling, recent studies have made progress in designing conversational agents that can provide more semantically accurate responses. However, the naturalness in  Cites: Towards a Human-like Open-Domain Chatbot
