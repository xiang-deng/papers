In microtask programming, developers complete short self-contained microtasks through the use of a specialized programming environment. For example, given only a short description of the purpose of a function and a partially complete implementation, a developer might be asked to identify, test, and implement an additional behavior in the function. Adopting a microtask approach to programming tasks has been envisioned to offer a number of potential benefits, including reducing Cites: Crowdsourcing systems on the world-wide web
