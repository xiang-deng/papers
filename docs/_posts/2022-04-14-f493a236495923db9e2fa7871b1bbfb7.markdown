Abstract Systems and methods are provided for performing a video-grounded dialogue task by a neural network model using bi-directional spatial-temporal reasoning. According to some embodiments, the systems and methods implement a dual network architecture or framework. This framework includes one network or reasoning module that learns dependencies between text and video in the direction of spatial temporal, and another network or reasoning module that learns in the Cites: Hybrid training of deep networks
