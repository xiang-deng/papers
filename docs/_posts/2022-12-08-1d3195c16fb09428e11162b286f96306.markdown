How to avoid biased predictions is an important and active research question in scene graph generation (SGG). Current state-of-the-art methods employ debiasing techniques such as resampling and causality analysis. However, the role of intrinsic cues in the features causing biased training has remained under-explored. In this paper, for the first time, we make the surprising observation that object identity information, in the form of object label embeddings (eg GLOVE), is principally …
