Transient stability preventive control (TSPC), regarded as generation rescheduling, plays an important role in maintaining secure and economic dispatch of power systems. To accommodate the increasing uncertainty of operation conditions, online TSPC is urgently required in real power systems. To this end, a new sequential online TSPC strategy driven by transient stability assessment (TSA) model interpretation is proposed in this paper. In this strategy, two data-driven TSA models Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
