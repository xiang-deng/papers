Real-world data and systems are generally evolutionary over time, which can be formalized as dynamic graphs, and Dynamic Graph Embedding (DGE) as a fundamental technique for analyzing dynamic graphs, has shown considerable potential in recent years. However, the majority of existing DGEs focus only on the local neighborhood structure, ignoring the global community structure, which is also an important property of dynamic graphs. Therefore, how to fuse both local and  Cites: Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder
