Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) has become a prominent area in natural language processing due to the emergence of large scale Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Semantic parsing based approach is the predominant direction to solve the KGQA task where natural language question is translated into a logic form such as SPARQL query. Recently Neural Machine Translation (NMT) based approaches are gaining momentum in order to translate natural language query to …
