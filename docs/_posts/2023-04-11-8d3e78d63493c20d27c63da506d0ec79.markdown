Trends in hardware, the prevalence of the cloud, and the rise of highly demanding applications have ushered an era of specialization that quickly changes how data is processed at scale. These changes are likely to continue and accelerate in the next years as new technologies are adopted and deployed: smart NICs, smart storage, smart memory, disaggregated storage, disaggregated memory, specialized accelerators (GPUS, TPUs, FPGAs), and a wealth of ASICs specifically created to  Cites: REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training
