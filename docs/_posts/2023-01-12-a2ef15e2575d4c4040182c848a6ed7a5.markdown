Multi-task learning (MTL) has been successfully implemented in many real-world applications, which aims to simultaneously solve multiple tasks with a single model. The general idea of multi-task learning is designing kinds of global parameter sharing mechanism and task-specific feature extractor to improve the performance of all tasks. However, sequential dependence between tasks are rarely studied but frequently encountered in e-commence online recommendation, eg impression, click Cites: K-adapter: Infusing knowledge into pre-trained models with adapters
