For traditional single-passage machine reading comprehension, the text data of a single passage does not well reflect the complexity of practical application scenarios. Many researchers have shifted their research goals to study multi-passage machine reading comprehension. To solve the problem of multi-passage machine reading comprehension, this paper proposes a unified multi-module end-to-end reading comprehension model for passage retrieval, answer extraction, and multi-answer  Cites: Joint Passage Ranking for Diverse Multi-Answer Retrieval
