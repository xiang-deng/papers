Numerous studies have explored the use of language models and question answering techniques for knowledge extraction. In most cases, these models are trained on data specific to the new task at hand. We hypothesize that using models trained only on generic question answering data (eg SQuAD) is a good starting point for domain specific entity extraction. We test this hypothesis, and explore whether the addition of small amounts of training data can help lift model performance. We pay  Cites: Answering Complex Open-domain Questions Through Iterative
