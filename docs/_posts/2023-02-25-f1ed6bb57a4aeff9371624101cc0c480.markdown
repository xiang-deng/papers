Graph data have become increasingly important, and graph node clustering has emerged as a fundamental task in data analysis. In recent years, graph node clustering has gradually moved from traditional shallow methods to deep neural networks due to the powerful representation capabilities of deep learning. In this article, we review some representatives of the latest graph node clustering methods, which are classified into three categories depending on their principles.
