Determining the taphole closing time is an essential task in the blast furnace ironmaking process because the closing time directly affects the efficiency of iron production and the stability of the blast furnace. However, at present, the taphole closing time in most ironmaking plants is judged by on-site workers based on experience, which lacks scientific guidance. To determine the taphole closing time intelligently and accurately, a novel monitoring method is proposed, which  Cites: Coatnet: Marrying convolution and attention for all data sizes
