Simultaneous translation is online decoding to translates with only subsentence. The goal of simultaneous translation research is to improve translation performance against delay. For this reason, most studies find trade-off performance between delays. We studied the experiments of the fixed policy-based simultaneous translation in Korean. Our experiments suggest that Korean tokenization causes many fragments, resulting in delay compared to other languages. We suggest follow Cites: Learning to translate in real-time with neural machine translation
