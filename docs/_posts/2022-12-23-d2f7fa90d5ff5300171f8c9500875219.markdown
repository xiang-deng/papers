Among existing knowledge graph based question answering (KGQA) methods, relation supervision methods require labeled intermediate relations for stepwise reasoning. To avoid this enormous cost of labeling on large-scale knowledge graphs, weak supervision methods, which use only the answer entity to evaluate rewards as supervision, have been introduced. However, lacking intermediate supervision raises the issue of sparse rewards, which may result in two types of …
