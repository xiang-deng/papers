The presence of sarcasm in online communication has motivated an increasing number of computational investigations of sarcasm across the scientific community. In this thesis, we build upon these investigations. Pointing out their limitations, we bring four contributions that span two research directions: sarcasm detection and sarcasm understanding. Sarcasm detection is the task of building computational models optimised for recognising sarcasm in a given text. These models are often …
