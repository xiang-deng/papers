We propose a hybrid planner-(deep) reinforcement learning (RL) architecture, RePReL, that leverages a relational planner to efficiently provide useful state abstractions. State abstractions have a tremendous advantage for better generalization and transfer in RL. Our framework takes an important step toward constructing these abstractions. Specifically, the framework enables multi-level abstractions by leveraging a high-level planner to communicate with a low-level  Cites: Neural logic machines
