Applying semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods, such as pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, to rotating machinery fault diagnosis alleviates the difficulty of obtaining a large amount of labeled data in industrial practice. However, the low accuracy of teacher models initially trained with limited labeled samples often affects the performance of pseudo-labeling methods. Besides, when the existing consistency regularization methods are applied to vibration signals, there is also the  Cites: Meta pseudo labels
