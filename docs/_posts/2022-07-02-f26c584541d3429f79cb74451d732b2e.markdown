Abstract Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is one of the key problems in Natural Language Processing, where the task is to read and comprehend a given text passage, and then answer questions based on it. MRC that requires discrete reasoning involving symbolic operations is a challenging task. Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs (DROP), introduced by AI2, is a benchmark which requires the natural language inference system to perform multiple discrete operations over the Cites: DROP: A Reading Comprehension Benchmark Requiring Discrete
