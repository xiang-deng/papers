Improving software performance is an important yet challenging part of the software development cycle. Today, the majority of performance inefficiencies are identified and patched by performance experts. Recent advancements in deep learning approaches and the wide-spread availability of open source data creates a great opportunity to automate the identification and patching of performance problems. In this paper, we present DeepPERF, a transformer-based approach to suggest
