Advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have fostered a wide spectrum of intelligent mobile applications ranging from voice assistants on smartphones to augmented reality with smart-glasses. To deliver high-quality services, these DNNs should operate on resource-constrained mobile platforms and yield consistent performance in open environments. However, DNNs are notoriously resource-intensive, and often suffer from performance degradation in real-world deployments  Cites: AutoHAS: Efficient hyperparameter and architecture search
