Graph embedding, which constructs vector representation of nodes in a network, has shown effectiveness in many graph analysis tasks, such as node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. However, due to the complexity of graph embedding models (GEMs) and their nontransparency of hyperparameters, evaluation and comparison of embedding results in retaining the original graph features, and consequently, the selection of suitable GEMs according to graph analysis tasks are
