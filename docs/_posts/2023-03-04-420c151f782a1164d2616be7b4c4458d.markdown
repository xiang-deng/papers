Entity alignment is a vital task in knowledge fusion, which aims to align entities from different knowledge graphs and merge them into one single graph. Existing entity alignment models focus on local features and try to minimize the distance between pairs of pre-aligned entities. Despite their success, these models heavily rely on the number of existing pre-aligned entity pairs and the topology information from the rest large set of unaligned entities is still largely unexplored.
