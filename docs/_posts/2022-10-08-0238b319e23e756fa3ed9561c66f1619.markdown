Currently, rumor detection models based on deep neural networks are widely used, but with the development of adversarial text technology, higher requirements are placed on the robustness of these models. In this paper, we analyze the influence of textual adversarial samples on the rumor detection model based on deep neural network for the first time. In order to accurately measure and analyze the impact of adversarial text on different structural models, we study and verify three mainstream  Cites: Word-level Textual Adversarial Attacking as Combinatorial
