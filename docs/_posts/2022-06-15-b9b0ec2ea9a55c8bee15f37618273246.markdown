Purpose Problem-solving is the most crucial key insight of scientific research. This study focuses on constructing the problem-solving knowledge graph of scientific domains by extracting four entity relation types: problem-solving, problem hierarchy, solution hierarchy and association. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a low-cost method for identifying these relationships in scientific papers based on word analogy. The problem-solving and hierarchical relations are
