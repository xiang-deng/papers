Adaptron is a cognitive architecture that is designed to control the intelligent behaviour of robots. It uses compositional hierarchies of binary neurons (binons) as its representational system. Binons are general-purpose, relational and functional nodes for representing knowledge, concepts and abilities. Adaptron satisfies many of the important requirements for artificial general intelligence. These requirements include purposeful, grounded, autonomous, general-purpose, scalable and reliable Cites: Achieving open vocabulary neural machine translation with hybrid
