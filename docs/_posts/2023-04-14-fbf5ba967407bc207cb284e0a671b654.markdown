In the past three decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have gained increased recognition as a potential substitute for inexpensive photovoltaic (PV) devices, and their maximum efficiency has grown from 7% to 14.3%. Recent developments in DSSCs have attracted a plethora of research activities geared at realizing their full potential. DSSCs have seen a revival as the finest technology for specific applications with unique features such as low-cost, non-toxic, colourful, transparent Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
