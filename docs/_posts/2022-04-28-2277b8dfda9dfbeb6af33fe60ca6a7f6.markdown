Significance: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a well-established neuroimaging technique, enables monitoring cortical activation while subjects are unconstrained. However, motion artifact is a common type of noise that can hamper the interpretation of fNIRS data. Current methods that have been proposed to mitigate motion artifacts in fNIRS data are still dependent on expert-based knowledge and the post hoc tuning of parameters. Aim: Here, we report a deep Cites: Boltzmann Machines and Denoising Autoencoders for Image
