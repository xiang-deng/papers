The key to generating the best deep learning model for predicting molecular property is to test and apply various optimization methods. While individual optimization methods from different past works outside the pharmaceutical domain each succeeded in improving the model performance, better improvement may be achieved when specific combinations of these methods and practices are applied. In this work, three high-performance optimization methods in the literature that have Cites: Strategies for pre-training graph neural networks
