The goal of document-grounded dialogue (DocGD) is to generate a response by grounding the evidence in a supporting document in accordance with the dialogue context. This process involves four variables that are causally connected. Recently, task-specific pre-training has greatly boosted performances on many downstream tasks. Existing DocGD methods, however, continue to rely on general pre-trained language models without a specifically tailored pre-training approach that explicitly Cites: Coqa: A conversational question answering challenge
