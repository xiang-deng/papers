In DARPA s view of the three waves of AI, the first wave of AI, symbolic AI, focused on explicit knowledge. The second and current wave of AI is termed statistical AI. Deep learning techniques have been able to exploit large amounts of data and massive computational power to improve human levels of performance in narrowly defined tasks. Separately, knowledge graphs have emerged as a powerful tool to capture and exploit a variety of explicit knowledge to make algorithms better apprehend the …
