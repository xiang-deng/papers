Facilitating the sharing of information between the two complementary tasks of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial to the study of Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLU extracts the core semantics from a given utterance, while NLG, in contrast, aims to construct the corresponding sentence based on the given semantics. However, model training for both research topics relies on manually annotated data, but the complexity of the Cites: Semantic parsing on freebase from question-answer pairs
