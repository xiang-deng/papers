Edge computing applications have recently gained prominence as the world of internet-of-things becomes increasingly embedded into people s lives. Performing computations at the edge addresses multiple issues, such as memory bandwidth-latency bottlenecks, exposure of sensitive data to external attackers, etc. It is important to protect the data collected and processed by edge devices, and also to prevent unauthorized access to such data. It is also important to ensure that the … Cites: ‪Smooth adversarial training‬
