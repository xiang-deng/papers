Abstract Predictive Business Process Monitoring (PBPM) is one of the essential tasks in Business Process Management (BPM). It aims to predict the future behavior of an ongoing case using completed cases of a process stored in the event log, such as the prediction of the next activity and outcome of the case, etc. Although various deep learning methods have been proposed for PBPM, none of them consider the simultaneous application to multiple predictive tasks. This paper proposes a multi Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
