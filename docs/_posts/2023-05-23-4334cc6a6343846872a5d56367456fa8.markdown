It is intractable to evaluate the performance of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) systems since GEC is a highly subjective task. Designing an evaluation metric that is as objective as possible is crucial to the development of GEC task. Previous mainstream evaluation metrics, ie, reference-based metrics, introduce bias into the multi-reference evaluation because they extract edits without considering the presence of multiple references. To overcome the problem, we propose Chunk-LEvel  Cites: On the Limitations of Reference-Free Evaluations of Generated Text
