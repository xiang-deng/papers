Open domain entity state tracking aims to predict reasonable state changes of entities (ie,[attribute] of [entity] was [before_state] and [after_state] afterwards) given the action descriptions. It s important to many reasoning tasks to support human everyday activities. However, it s challenging as the model needs to predict an arbitrary number of entity state changes caused by the action while most of the entities are implicitly relevant to the actions and their attributes as well as states are  Cites: Tracking state changes in procedural text: a challenge dataset and
