Uncertainty quantification is an essential topic in statistical analysis. In deep learning models, the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of CNN has been largely overlooked. Among the few existing UQ approaches that have been proposed for deep learning, few have theoretical consistency that can guarantee the uncertainty quality. Lack of efficient UQ tools severely limits the application of CNN in certain areas, such as medicine, where prediction uncertainty is critically important.
