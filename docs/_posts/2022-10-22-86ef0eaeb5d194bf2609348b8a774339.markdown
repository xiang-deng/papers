Deep Learning has proliferated dramatically across consumer devices in less than a decade, but has been largely powered through the hardware acceleration within isolated devices. Nonetheless, clear signals exist that the next decade of consumer intelligence will require levels of resources, a mixing of modalities and a collaboration of devices that will demand a significant pivot beyond hardware alone. To accomplish this, we believe a new Edge-AI paradigm will be necessary for this …
