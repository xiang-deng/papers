There has been a recent surge of interest in automating software engineering tasks using deep learning. This work addresses the problem of code generation where the goal is to generate target code given source code in a different language or a natural language description. Most of the state-of-the-art deep learning models for code generation use training strategies that are primarily designed for natural language. However, understanding and generating code requires a more rigorous Cites: Dawn Drain
