While the state-of-the-art for frame semantic parsing has progressed dramatically in recent years, it is still difficult for end-users to apply state-of-the-art models in practice. To address this, we present Frame Semantic Transformer, an open-source Python library which achieves near state-of-the-art performance on FrameNet 1.7, while focusing on ease-of-use. We use a T5 model fine-tuned on Propbank and FrameNet exemplars as a base, and improve performance by using FrameNet lexical …
