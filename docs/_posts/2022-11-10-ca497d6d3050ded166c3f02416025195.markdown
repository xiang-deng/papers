End-to-end (E2E) task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems are prone to fall into the so-called likelihood trap , resulting in generated responses which are dull, repetitive, and often inconsistent with dialogue history. Comparing ranked lists of multiple generated responses against the gold response (from training data) reveals a wide diversity in response quality, with many good responses placed lower in the ranked list. The main challenge, addressed in this work, is then how to reach beyond …
