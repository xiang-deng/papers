While Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has achieved great progress in recent years, it still suffers from inaccurate translation of entities (eg, person/organization name, location), due to the lack of entity training instances. When we humans encounter an unknown entity during translation, we usually first look up in a dictionary and then organize the entity translation together with the translations of other parts to form a smooth target sentence. Inspired by this translation process, we  Cites: DEEP: DEnoising Entity Pre-training for Neural Machine Translation
