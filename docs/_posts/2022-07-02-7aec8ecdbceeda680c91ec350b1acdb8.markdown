Intense spatiotemporal coupling states frequently appear in robotic tasks, and this coupling enriches the information encapsulated in each state. Taking advantage of historical observations can provide more information about the robot, especially for partially observable Markov decision processes. How to deal with this coupling remains a challenging issue in robotic reinforcement learning (RL), and we allege that the imbalanced processing capability of spatiotemporal details is one of the
