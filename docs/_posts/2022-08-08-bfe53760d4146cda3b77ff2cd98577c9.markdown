We advocate for and propose a novel knowledge tracing model, called CMKT, that utilizes an educational concept map for learner modeling. This study particularly addresses the issue of learner data sparseness caused by the unwillingness to practice and irregular learning behaviors on the learner side. CMKT considers the concept map as a new information source and explicitly exploits its inherent information to help the estimation of learner s knowledge state. Specifically, the Cites: Structured learning with constrained conditional models
