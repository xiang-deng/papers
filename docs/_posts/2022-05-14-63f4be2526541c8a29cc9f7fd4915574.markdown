In this study we explore the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) governance to system development life cycle (SDLC) models. We conducted expert interviews among AI and SDLC professionals and analyzed the interview data using qualitative coding and clustering to extract AI governance concepts. Subsequently, we mapped these concepts onto three stages in the machine learning (ML) system development process:(1) design,(2) development, and (3) operation. We discovered 20 Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
