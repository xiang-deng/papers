Abstract Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI Codex are increasingly being used as AI-based coding assistants. Understanding the impact of these tools on developers code is paramount, especially as recent work showed that LLMs may suggest cybersecurity vulnerabilities. We conduct a securitydriven user study (N= 58) to assess code written by student programmers when assisted by LLMs. Given the potential severity of low-level bugs as well as their relative frequency in real-world Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
