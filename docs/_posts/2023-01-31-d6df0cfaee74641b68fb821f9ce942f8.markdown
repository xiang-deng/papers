Abstract Language neuroscience currently relies on two major experimental paradigms: controlled experiments using carefully hand-designed stimuli, and natural stimulus experiments. These approaches have complementary advantages which allow them to address distinct aspects of the neurobiology of language, but each approach also comes with drawbacks. Here we discuss a third paradigmin silico experimentation using deep learning-based encoding modelsthat has been  Cites: What does BERT look at? An analysis of BERT s attention
