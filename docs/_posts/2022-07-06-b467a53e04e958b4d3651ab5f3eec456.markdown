Abstract Product Design based Knowledge graphs (KG) aid the representation of product assemblies through heterogeneous relationships that link entities obtained from multiple structured and unstructured sources. This study describes an approach to constructing a multi-relational and multi-hierarchical knowledge graph that extracts information contained within the 3D product model data to construct Assembly-Subassembly-Part and Shape Similarity relationships. This approach builds on a …
