Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have gained considerable attention in the past decades due to their astounding performance in different applications, such as natural language modeling, self-driving assistance, and source code understanding. With rapid exploration, more and more complex DNN architectures have been proposed along with huge pre-trained model parameters. The common way to use such DNN models in user-friendly devices (eg, mobile phones) is to perform model Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
