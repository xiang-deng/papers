Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to extract< subject, predicate, object> relationships in images for vision understanding. Although recent works have made steady progress on SGG, they still suffer long-tail distribution issues that tail-predicates are more costly to train and hard to distinguish due to a small amount of annotated data compared to frequent predicates. Existing re-balancing strategies try to haddle it via prior rules but are still confined to pre-defined conditions, which are Cites: Fine-Grained Scene Graph Generation with Data Transfer
