The exponential proliferation of fake news in recent years has emphasized the demand for automated fake news detection. Several techniques for detecting fake news have yielded encouraging results. However, these detection systems lack explainability ie, providing the reason for their prediction. The critical advantage of explainability is the identification of bias and discrimination in detection algorithms. There are very few surveys conducted on the area of explainable AI applied to fake Cites: Is Attention Interpretable?
