With the privatization deployment of DNNs on edge devices, the security of on-device DNNs has raised significant concern. To quantify the model leakage risk of on-device DNNs automatically, we propose NNReverse, the first learning-based method which can reverse DNNs from AI programs without domain knowledge. NNReverse trains a representation model to represent the semantics of binary code for DNN layers. By searching the most similar function in our database, NNReverse infers the layer type  Cites: Thieves on Sesame Street! Model Extraction of BERT-based APIs
