The RVL-CDIP benchmark is widely used for measuring performance on the task of document classification. Despite its widespread use, we reveal several undesirable characteristics of the RVL-CDIP benchmark. These include (1) substantial amounts of label noise, which we estimate to be 8.1%(ranging between 1.6% to 16.9% per document category);(2) presence of many ambiguous or multi-label documents;(3) a large overlap between test and train splits, which can inflate model performance Cites: Question and answer test-train overlap in open-domain question
