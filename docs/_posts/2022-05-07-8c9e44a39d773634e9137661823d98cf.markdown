This volume is devoted to the emerging field of Integrated Visual Knowledge Discovery that combines advances in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) and Visualization/Visual Analytics. Chapters included are extended versions of the selected AI and Visual Analytics papers and related symposia at the recent International Information Visualization Conferences (IV2019 and IV2020). AI/ML face a long-standing challenge of explaining models to humans. Models explanation is Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
