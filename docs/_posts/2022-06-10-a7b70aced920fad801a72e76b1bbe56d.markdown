Data augmentation with\textbf {Mixup} has been proven an effective method to regularize the current deep neural networks. Mixup generates virtual samples and corresponding labels at once through linear interpolation. However, this one-stage generation paradigm and the use of linear interpolation have the following two defects:(1) The label of the generated sample is directly combined from the labels of the original sample pairs without reasonable judgment, which makes the labels likely Cites: Learning question classifiers
