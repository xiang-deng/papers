We present Marvista--a human-AI collaborative tool that employs a suite of natural language processing models to provide end-to-end support for reading online articles. Before reading an article, Marvista helps a user plan what to read by filtering text based on how much time one can spend and what questions one is interested to find out from the article. During reading, Marvista helps the user focus on one paragraph at a time and reflect on their understanding of each paragraph with AI Cites: Jingfei Du, Mandar Joshi, Danqi Chen, Omer Levy, Mike Lewis
