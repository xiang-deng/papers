Graph Neural Networks have attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, existing GNN frameworks are deployed based upon simple graphs, which limits their applications in dealing with complex data correlation of multi-modal/multi-type data in practice. A few hypergraph-based methods have recently been proposed to address the problem of multi-modal/multi-type data correlation by directly concatenating the hypergraphs constructed from each single individual  Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
