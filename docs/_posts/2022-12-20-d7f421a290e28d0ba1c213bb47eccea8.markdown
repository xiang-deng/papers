Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to annotate unlabeled target domain samples by utilizing transferable knowledge learned from the source domain. Optimal transport (OT) has become a popular probability metric to measure the distribution discrepancy across domains. However, most OT-based methods inevitably suffer from false matching problem, resulting in poor domain alignment. Furthermore, because the domain shift cannot be completely eliminated, some target domain data Cites: Understanding self-training for gradual domain adaptation
