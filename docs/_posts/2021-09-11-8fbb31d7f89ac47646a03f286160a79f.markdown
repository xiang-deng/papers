Modern semantic parsers suffer from two principal limitations. First, training requires expensive collection of utterance-program pairs. Second, semantic parsers fail to generalize at test time to new compositions/structures that have not been observed during training. Recent research has shown that automatic generation of synthetic utterance-program pairs can alleviate the first problem, but its potential for the second has thus far been under-explored. In this work, we investigate automatic Cites: Meta-Learning to Compositionally Generalize
