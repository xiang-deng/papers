Weakly-supervised table question-answering (TableQA) models have achieved state- of-art performance by using pre-trained BERT transformer to jointly encoding a question and a table to produce structured query for the question. However, in practical settings TableQA systems are deployed over table corpora having topic and word distributions quite distinct from BERT s pretraining corpus. In this work we simulate the practical topic shift scenario by designing novel challenge benchmarks Cites: Question Generation from SQL Queries Improves Neural Semantic
