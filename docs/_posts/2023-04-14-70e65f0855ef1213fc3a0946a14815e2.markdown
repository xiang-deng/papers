The COVID-19 pandemic has generated massive data in the healthcare sector in recent years, encouraging researchers and scientists to uncover the underlying facts. Mining interesting patterns in the large COVID-19 corpora is very important and useful for the decision makers. This paper presents a novel approach for uncovering interesting insights in large datasets using ontologies and BERT models. The research proposes a framework for extracting semantically rich facts from data by Cites: QuAC: Question Answering in Context
