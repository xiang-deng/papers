Much of the existing work in NLP on causality focuses on understanding commonsense causal relationships, thus failing to assess whether the model s reasoning abilities include formal causal inference. To address this, we propose a new NLP task, causal Cites: Impact of pretraining term frequencies on few-shot numerical
