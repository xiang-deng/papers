Cross-platform binary analysis requires a common representation of binaries across platforms, on which a specific analysis can be performed. Recent work proposed to learn low-dimensional, numeric vector representations (ie, embeddings) of disassembled binary code, and perform binary analysis in the embedding space. Unfortunately, however, existing techniques fall short in that they are either (i) specific to a single platform producing embeddings not aligned across platforms, or Cites: Network Representation Learning with Rich Text Information
