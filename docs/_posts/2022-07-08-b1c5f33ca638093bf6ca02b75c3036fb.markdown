The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted daily lives around the globe. Since 2019, the amount of literature focusing on COVID-19 has risen exponentially. However, it is almost impossible for humans to read all of the studies and classify them. This article proposes a method of making an unsupervised model called a zero-shot classification model, based on the pre-trained BERT model. We used the CORD-19 dataset in conjunction with the LitCovid database to construct new vocabulary and Cites: Benchmarking zero-shot text classification: Datasets, evaluation
