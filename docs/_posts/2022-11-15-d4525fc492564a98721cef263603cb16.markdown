It is difficult to effectively operate a dual-arm robot using only the information written in a cooking recipe. To cope with this problem, this paper proposes a graph-based approach on bimanual cooking motion planning from a cooking recipe. In our approach, we first decompose the cooking recipe into graph elements. Then, we try to connect the graph elements taking into account the attributes of the input/output nodes. If two graph elements cannot be connected to each other, we search for a Cites: Enabling Robots to Understand Incomplete Natural Language
