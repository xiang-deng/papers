In the last years, weakly supervised models have aided in the mass detection using mammography images, decreasing the need for pixel-level annotations. Most of the models in literature are based on CAM activation maps, not exploring the use of other activation methods for detection in mammography images. This works presents a study of different state-of-the-art activation maps methods, applied to weakly supervised training in mammography images. In this study, we compare the methods …
