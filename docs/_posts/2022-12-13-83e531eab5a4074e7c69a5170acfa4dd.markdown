The link prediction on knowledge graphs is now one of the challenges that are gaining a lot of interest from the academic community. The leading solution for this problem is based on graph embedding. Recently, in embedding approaches, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have produced promising results, especially the HypER model. The HypER model outperforms the preceding approaches to maximize the quantity of information from the source entities and relations. However …
