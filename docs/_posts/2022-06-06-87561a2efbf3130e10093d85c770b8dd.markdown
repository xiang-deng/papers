This thesis consists of three parts that progressively transition from neuroscience topics to interpretability of language models. The common denominator of these three parts is the use of deep learning methods. In the first part, we present a solution to address the scarcity of data available to train epilepsy monitoring systems. We design a deep generative model, EpilepsyGAN, which generates synthetic data that can train seizure detection algorithms without a degradation in performance. Then Cites: Improving transformer models by reordering their sublayers
