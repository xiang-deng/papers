Electricity demand forecasting plays a vital role in power system planning, operation, transmission design, and financial risk management. In this study, we employ a Gaussian Process model to estimate the probability distributions of short term electricity demand. To account for input uncertainty in multiperiod ahead forecast, we adopt an error propagation procedure that improves upon the naive recursive forecasting. This method is shown to perform well in terms of multistep ahead point Cites: Load forecasting using support vector machines: A study on
