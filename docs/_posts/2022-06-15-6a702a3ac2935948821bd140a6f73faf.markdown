Early diagnosis of Alzheimer s is crucial to slow the progression of the disease. In this regard, there are many attempts to detect this disease at the early stages using AI techniques such as deep learning. We have proposed an explainable method to solve the early‐stage detection of Alzheimer s using transfer learning as a well‐known approach when there is not enough data. The employed transfer learning method is a combination of fine‐tuned ResNet‐50 and Inception‐V3 with Soft‐max …
