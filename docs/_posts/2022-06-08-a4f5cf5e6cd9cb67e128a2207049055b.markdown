Target detection at the hive gate of a beehive can be used to effectively monitor invasive beehive species. However, in the natural environment, there is often a multi-target and multi-scale problem at the hive gate, making it difficult for beekeepers to accurately detect the internal state of the hive.(1) To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an improved RetinaNet target detection network, DY-RetinaNet, for the identification of common species at the hive doors of beehives in natural  Cites: Nas-fpn: Learning scalable feature pyramid architecture for object
