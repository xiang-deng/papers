Building models with limited data is one of the key steps towards the application of deep learning models in realistic scenarios. Under the framework of representation learning, we propose several novel algorithms for tackling challenging tasks in building models with limited data, including standard few-shot learning, incremental few-shot learning, and unsupervised few-shot learning. In the first part of this thesis, we propose an approach to learn low-rank representation that generalizes well to a …
