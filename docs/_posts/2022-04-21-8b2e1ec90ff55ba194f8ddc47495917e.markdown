Backscatter communication suggests a low-cost solution to connect billions of devices through wireless signals and realize the vision of the Internet Of Things (IoT). However, due to challenges such as deployment complexity, reliability, and scalability, the promise of ubiquitous backscatter connectivity has eluded us. In this writing, I suggest three solutions to address these challenges and enable widespread backscatter connectivity. First, I introduce  Full-Duplex LoRa Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
