This paper focuses on multi-label learning from small number of labelled data. We demonstrate that the straightforward binary-relevance extension of the interpolated label propagation algorithm, the harmonic function, is a competitive learning method with respect to many widely-used evaluation measures. This is achieved mainly by a new transition matrix that better captures the underlying manifold structure. Furthermore, we show that when there exists label dependence, we can use the …
