Keyphrases can concisely describe the high-level topics discussed in a document that usually possesses hierarchical topic structures. Thus, it is crucial to understand the hierarchical topic structures and employ it to guide the keyphrase identification. However, integrating the hierarchical topic information into a deep keyphrase generation model is unexplored. In this paper, we focus on how to effectively exploit the hierarchical topic to improve the keyphrase generation performance (HTKG) Cites: Text summarization with latent queries
