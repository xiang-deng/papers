Automated tools which can understand and interface with CAD (computer-aided design) models are of significant research interest due to the potential for improving efficiency in manufacturing processes. At present, most research into the use of artificial intelligence to interpret three-dimensional data takes input in the form of multiple two-dimensional images of the object or in the form of three-dimensional grids of voxels. The transformation of the input data necessary for these approaches Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
