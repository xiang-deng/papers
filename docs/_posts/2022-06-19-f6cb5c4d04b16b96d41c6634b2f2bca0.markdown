Domain generalization methods aim to learn models robust to domain shift with data from a limited number of source domains and without access to target domain samples during training. Popular domain alignment methods for domain generalization seek to extract domain-invariant features by minimizing the discrepancy between feature distributions across all domains, disregarding inter-domain relationships. In this paper, we instead propose a novel representation …
