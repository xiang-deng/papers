Data Augmentation (DA) is known to improve the generalizability of deep neural networks. Most existing DA techniques naively add a certain number of augmented samples without considering the quality and the added computational cost of these samples. To tackle this problem, a common strategy, adopted by several state-of-the- art DA methods, is to adaptively generate or re-weight augmented samples with respect to the task objective during training. However, these adaptive DA Cites: SSMBA: Self-supervised manifold based data augmentation for
