With the increasing amount of Internet textual data, semantic hashing is a suitable approach for approximate searching in large text collections, owing to the computational and storage efficiencies of compact binary codes. Original text data can be represented using compact binary codes through semantic hashing. The hash code is treated as a document address space, to which the documents are mapped, such that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses …
