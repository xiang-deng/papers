Entity linking (EL) in written language domains has been extensively studied, but EL of spoken language is still unexplored. We propose a conceptually simple and highly effective two-stage approach to tackle this issue. The first stage retrieves candidates with a dual encoder, which independently encodes mention context and entity descriptions. Each candidate is then reranked by a LUKE-based cross-encoder, which concatenates the mention and entity description. Different from previous cross  Cites: Zero-Shot Entity Linking by Reading Entity Descriptions
