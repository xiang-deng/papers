Current SQL generators based on pre-trained language models struggle to answer complex questions requiring domain context or understanding fine-grained table structure. Humans would deal with these unknowns by reasoning over the documentation of the tables. Based on this hypothesis, we propose DocuT5, which uses off-the-shelf language model architecture and injects knowledge from externaldocumentation to improve domain generalization. We perform experiments  Cites: TaBERT: Pretraining for Joint Understanding of Textual and
