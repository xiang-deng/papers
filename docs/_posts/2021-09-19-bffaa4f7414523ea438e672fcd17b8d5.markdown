This article describes HAHATeam participation in the Iber-LEF 2021 EmoEvalEs task: Emotion detection and Evaluation for Spanish. In this task, we use Masked Language Model-based data augmentation to enhance the data to increase the training data set and prevent overfitting. We improve the performance of the model through a series of data processing and data augmentation technologies. We use three different cross-language models, BERT, XLM, and XLM-RoBERTa for Cites: Effective LSTMs for target-dependent sentiment classification
