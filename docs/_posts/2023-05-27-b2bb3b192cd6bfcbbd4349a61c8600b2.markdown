Acceptability and trust toward an Artificial Agent (AA) are known to be strongly related to the transparency of its behavior. However, the opacity of the AI techniques implemented to drive the behavior of AAs is growing in parallel with their performance (performance/transparency trade-off). Thus, it is crucial and increasingly required to identify minimal and necessary information for achieving efficient human/AA interaction in order to include them as AAs requirements at design stage  Cites: Does the Whole Exceed its Parts?
