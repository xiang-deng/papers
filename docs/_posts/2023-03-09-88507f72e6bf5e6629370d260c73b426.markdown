Knowledge graph embeddings widely participate in solving many problems together with deep learning, such as natural language understanding and named entity recognition. The quality of knowledge graph embeddings highly affects the performance of the models on many knowledge-involved tasks. Link prediction (LP) and triple classification (TC) are widely adopted to evaluate the performance of knowledge graph embeddings. Link prediction is to predict the missing entity that …
