Abstract Information extraction provides the basic technical support for knowledge graph construction and Web applications. Named entity recognition (NER) is one of the fundamental tasks of information extraction. Recognizing unseen entities from numerous contents with the support of only a few labeled samples, also termed as few-shot learning, is a crucial issue to be studied. Few-shot NER aims at identifying emerging named entities from the context with the support of a few labeled samples …
