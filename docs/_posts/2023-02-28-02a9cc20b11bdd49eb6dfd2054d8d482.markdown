Logs are pervasive in modern computing systems, and are valuable to service and system management. Nevertheless, with the rapidly growing size and complexity of computing systems, the log volume is exploding, which makes automatic log analysis imperative. Generally, in automatic log analysis, the first and fundamental step is log parsing, to which a lot of effort has been devoted. However, in most existing log parsing methods, log messages are merely treated as plain text. In natural language  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
