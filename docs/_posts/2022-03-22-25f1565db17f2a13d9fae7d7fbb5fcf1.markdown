Simile interpretation is a crucial task in natural language processing. Nowadays, pre- trained language models (PLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many tasks. However, it remains under-explored whether PLMs can interpret similes or not. In this paper, we investigate the ability of PLMs in simile interpretation by designing a novel task named Simile Property Probing, ie, to let the PLMs infer the shared properties of similes. We construct our simile property probing datasets from Cites: It s not Rocket Science: Interpreting Figurative Language in
