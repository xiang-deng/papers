Abstract Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a vital role in natural language processing (NLP), which can serve several downstream tasks. Because different views of KGs are usually constructed independently, the multi-view knowledge graph fusion (MVKGF) becomes a hotspot. Although multi-view learning studied very well in past decades, MVKGF is still not well tackled because of the heterogeneous relations and the multi-view KGs. To overcome MVKGF, entity alignment is the most studied …
