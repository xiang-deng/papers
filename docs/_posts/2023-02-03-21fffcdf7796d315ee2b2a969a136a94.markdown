Friction stir welding is a material processing technique used to combine dissimilar and similar materials. Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) is one of the most common objectives of welding, especially friction stir welding (FSW). Typically, destructive testing is utilized to measure the UTS of a welded seam. Testing for the UTS of a weld seam typically involves cutting the specimen and utilizing a machine capable of testing for UTS. In this study, an ensemble deep learning model was developed to Cites: Efficientnetv2: Smaller models and faster training
