Text-based logical reasoning requires the model to understand the semantics of input text, and then understand the complex logical relationships within the text. Previous works equip pre-trained language models with the logical reasoning ability by training these models on datasets obtained by logical-driven text extension. However, these methods only generate instances based on logical expressions entailed within the input text. And we argue that external commonsense knowledge …
