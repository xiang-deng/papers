We present an efficient method of pretraining large-scale autoencoding language models using training signals generated by an auxiliary model. Originated in ELECTRA, this training strategy has demonstrated sample-efficiency to pretrain models at the scale of hundreds of millions of parameters. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study, and propose a recipe, namely Model generated dEnoising TRaining Objective (METRO), which incorporates some of the best Cites: Large Dual Encoders Are Generalizable Retrievers
