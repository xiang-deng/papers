We study recognizing attributes for objects in visual scenes. We consider attributes to be any phrases that describe an object s physical and semantic properties, and its relationships with other objects. Existing work studies attribute prediction in a closed setting with a fixed set of attributes, and implements a model that uses limited context. We propose TAP, a new Transformer-based model that can utilize context and predict attributes for multiple objects in a scene in a single forward pass, and a …
