With the explosive growth of scientific publications, making the synthesis of scientific knowledge and fact checking becomes an increasingly complex task. In this paper, we propose a multi-task approach for verifying the scientific questions based on a joint reasoning from facts and evidence in research articles. We propose an intelligent combination of (1) an automatic information summarization and (2) a Boolean Question Answering which allows to generate an answer to a scientific Cites: Unsupervised question answering by cloze translation
