In a real-world dialogue system, generated responses must satisfy several interlocking constraints: being informative, truthful, and easy to control. The two predominant paradigms in language generation--neural language modeling and rule-based generation--both struggle to satisfy these constraints. Even the best neural models are prone to hallucination and omission of information, while existing formalisms for rule-based generation make it difficult to write grammars that are both Cites: Neurologic a* esque decoding: Constrained text generation with
