Text-to-SQL parsers typically struggle with databases unseen during the train time. Adapting parsers to new databases is a challenging problem due to the lack of natural language queries in the new schemas. We present ReFill, a framework for synthesizing high-quality and textually diverse parallel datasets for adapting a Text-to-SQL parser to a target schema. ReFill learns to retrieve-and-edit text queries from the existing schemas and transfers them to the target schema. We show that Cites: Weakly Supervised Mapping of Natural Language to SQL through
