Pool-based Active Learning (AL) has achieved great success in minimizing labeling cost by sequentially selecting informative unlabeled samples from a large unlabeled data pool and querying their labels from oracle/annotators. However, existing AL sampling strategies might not work well in out-of-distribution (OOD) data scenarios, where the unlabeled data pool contains some data samples that do not belong to the classes of the target task. Achieving good AL performance under OOD data  Cites: Mind your outliers! investigating the negative impact of outliers on
