As one of the fundamental research areas of natural language processing, sentence similarity computation attracts researchers  attention. Considering two single independent sentences, it is difficult to measure the similarity between them without sufficient context information. To solve this issue, we propose a joint FrameNet and element focusing Sentence-BERT method of sentence similarity computation (FEFS3C). Considering the actual meaning of sentences, we adopt the frame Cites: Question answering using enhanced lexical semantic models
