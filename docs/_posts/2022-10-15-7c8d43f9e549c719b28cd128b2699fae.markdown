Translating natural language queries (NLQ) into structured query language (SQL) in interfaces to relational databases is a challenging task that has been widely studied by researchers from both the database and natural language processing communities. Numerous works have been proposed to attack the natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDB) problem either as a conventional pipeline-based or an end-to-end deep-learning-based solution. Nevertheless, regardless of the Cites: Rat-sql: Relation-aware schema encoding and linking for text-to
