The traditional framework of federated learning (FL) requires each client to re-train their models in every iteration, making it infeasible for resource-constrained mobile devices to train deep-learning (DL) models. Split learning (SL) provides an alternative by using a centralized server to offload the computation of activations and gradients for a subset of the model but suffers from problems of slow convergence and lower accuracy. In this paper, we implement PFSL, a new framework of …
