Element property is a crucial aspect of building information modeling (BIM) for almost all BIMbased engineering tasks. Since there are limited properties predefined in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) specifications, a vast number of property concepts were customized and stored in BIM models, which lack laborintensive data modeling and alignment for effective information management and reuse. To tackle the challenge, this study presents a natural language understanding (NLU)based  Cites: Detecting formal thought disorder by deep contextualized word
