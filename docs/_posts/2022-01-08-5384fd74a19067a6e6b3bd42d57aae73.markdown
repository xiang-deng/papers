Deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance in a variety of tasks over the last decade, such as autonomous driving, face recognition, and medical diagnosis. However, prior works show that deep neural networks are easily manipulated into specific, attacker-decided behaviors in the inference stage by backdoor attacks which inject malicious small hidden triggers into model training, raising serious security threats. To determine the triggered neurons and protect Cites: Certified defenses for data poisoning attacks
