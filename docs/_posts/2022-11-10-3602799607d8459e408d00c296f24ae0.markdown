Deep forest [1] is a tree-based deep model made up of non-differentiable modules that are trained without backpropagation. Despite the fact that deep forests have achieved considerable success in a variety of tasks, feature concatenation, the ingredient for forest representation learning still lacks theoretical understanding. In this paper, we aim to understand the influence of feature concatenation on predictive performance. To enable such theoretical studies, we present the first mathematical Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
