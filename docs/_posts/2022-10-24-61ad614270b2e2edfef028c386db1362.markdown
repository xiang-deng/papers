This paper addresses the task of contextual translation using multi-segment models. Specifically we show that increasing model capacity further pushes the limits of this approach and that deeper models are more suited to capture context dependencies. Furthermore, improvements observed with larger models can be transferred to smaller models using knowledge distillation. Our experiments show that this approach achieves competitive performance across several languages and Cites: When Does Translation Require Context? A Data-driven
