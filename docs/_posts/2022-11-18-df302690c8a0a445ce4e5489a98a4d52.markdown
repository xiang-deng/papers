In the real world, various kinds of data are able to be represented as heterogeneous graph structures. Heterogeneous graphs with multi-typed nodes and edges contain rich messages of heterogeneity and complex semantic information. Recently, diverse heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have emerged to solve a range of tasks in this advanced area, such as node classification, knowledge graphs, etc. Heterogeneous graph embedding is a crucial step in HGNNs. It aims to embed rich  Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
