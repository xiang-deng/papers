We introduce a new benchmark for assessing the quality of text-to-text models for Polish. The benchmark consists of diverse tasks and datasets: KLEJ benchmark adapted for text-to-text, en-pl translation, summarization, and question answering. In particular, since summarization and question answering lack benchmark datasets for the Polish language, we describe their construction and make them publicly available. Additionally, we present plT5-a general-purpose text-to-text model for … Cites: ‪Multilingual denoising pre-training for neural machine translation‬
