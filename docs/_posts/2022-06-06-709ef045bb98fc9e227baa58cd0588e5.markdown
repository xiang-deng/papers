Abstract Existing End-to-End neural models for dialogue generation tend to generate generic and uninformative responses. Recently, knowledge-based dialogue models have been developed to generate more informative responses by leveraging external knowledge. However, it is still challenging for the models to select appropriate knowledge from an external knowledge base and generate responses coherent with the context and knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new method …
