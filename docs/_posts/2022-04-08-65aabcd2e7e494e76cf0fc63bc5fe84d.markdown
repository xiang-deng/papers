We consider whether it is possible to do text simplification without relying on a parallel  corpus, one that is made up of sentence-by-sentence alignments of complex and ground truth simple sentences. To this end, we introduce a number of concepts, some new and some not, including what we call Conjoined Twin Networks, Flip-Flop Auto-Encoders (FFA) and Adversarial Networks (GAN). A comparison is made between Jensen-Shannon (JS-GAN) and Wasserstein GAN, to see how they impact Cites: Sentence simplification with deep reinforcement learning
