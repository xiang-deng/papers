Gradients have been exploited in proposal distributions to accelerate the convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms on discrete distributions. However, these methods require a natural differentiable extension of the target discrete distribution, which often does not exist or does not provide effective gradient guidance. In this paper, we develop a gradient-like proposal for any discrete distribution without this strong requirement. Built upon a locally-balanced proposal …
