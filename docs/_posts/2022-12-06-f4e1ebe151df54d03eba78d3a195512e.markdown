Abstract Natural Language Inference is a fundamental task required for understanding natural language. With the introduction of large Natural Language Inference (NLI) benchmark datasets such as SNLI and MultiNLI, NLI has seen an uptake in models achieving near-human accuracy. Deeper analyses through adversarial methods performed on these models however have cast doubts on their ability to actually understand the inference process. In this work, we attempt to define  Cites: ConjNLI: Natural Language Inference Over Conjunctive Sentences
