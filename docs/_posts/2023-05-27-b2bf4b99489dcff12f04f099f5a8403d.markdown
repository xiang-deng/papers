Few-shot learning for open domain multi-hop question answering typically relies on large language models (LLMs). While powerful, LLMs are inefficient at the inference time. We propose a data synthesis framework for multi-hop question answering that allows for improving smaller language models with less than 10 human-annotated question answer pairs. The framework is built upon the data generation functions parameterized by LLMs and prompts, which requires minimal hand-crafted features  Cites: Answering questions by meta-reasoning over multiple chains of
