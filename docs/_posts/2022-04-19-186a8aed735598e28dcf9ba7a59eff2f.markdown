Molecular topology allows describing molecular structures following a two- dimensional approach by taking into account how the atoms are arranged internally through a connection matrix between the atoms that are part of a structure. Various molecular indices (unique for each molecule) can be determined, such as Zagreb, Balaban, and topological indices. These indices have been correlated with physical chemistry properties such as molecular weight, boiling point, and electron density Cites: Masked graph modeling for molecule generation
