Recently, major breakthroughs were achieved in Machine Translation (MT) by explicitly memorizing patterns in datastores, which are retrieved at inference time. However, this improvement came at the cost of having to deal with rather large datastores, which can become prohibitively expensive in terms of computing power. On the other hand, by tuning certain hyper-parameters (such as the number of entries of the datastore used for classifying a sample), an overall better quality of Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
