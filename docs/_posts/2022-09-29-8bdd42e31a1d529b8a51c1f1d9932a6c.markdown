The joint entity and relation extraction method establishes a bond between tasks, surpassing sequential extraction based on the pipeline method. Many joint works focus on learning a unified representation for both tasks to explore the correlations between Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE). However, they suffer from the feature confusion that features extracted from one task may conflict with those from the other. To address this issue, we propose a novel Dual Cites: A linear programming formulation for global inference in natural
