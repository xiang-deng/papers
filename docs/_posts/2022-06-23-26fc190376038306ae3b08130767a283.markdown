To achieve high accuracy in machine learning (ML) systems, practitioners often use complex black-box models that are not easily understood by humans. The opacity of such models has resulted in public concerns about their use in high-stakes contexts and given rise to two conflicting arguments about the natureand even the existenceof the accuracy-explainability trade-off. One side postulates that model accuracy and explainability are inversely related, leading practitioners to use black
