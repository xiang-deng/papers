With the increasing scale of data sets and neural network models, distributed training of deep neural networks has become a trend. The main distributed parallel technology is based on expert experience, it is low efficient and hard to optimize as it needs lots of domain knowledge. There are some researchers have proposed auto-parallel technology to implement model distributed training which focused on specific models and parallel optimization factors. These methods have the problems of single Cites: Dynet: The dynamic neural network toolkit
