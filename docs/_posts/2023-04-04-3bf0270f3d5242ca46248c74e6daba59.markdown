Smart contracts in blockchains have been increasingly used for high-value business applications. It is essential to check smart contracts reliability before and after deployment. Although various program analysis and deep learning techniques have been proposed to detect vulnerabilities in either Ethereum smart contract source code or bytecode, their detection accuracy and scalability are still limited. This paper presents a novel framework named MANDO-HGT for detecting smart contract Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
