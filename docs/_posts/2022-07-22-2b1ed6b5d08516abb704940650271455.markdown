This work explores how the causality inference paradigm may be applied to troubleshoot the root causes of failures through language processing and Deep Learning. To do so, the causality hierarchy has been taken for reference: associative, interventional, and retrospective levels of causality have thus been researched within textual data in the form of a failure analysis ontology and a set of written records on Return On Experience. A novel approach to extracting linguistic knowledge has been Cites: A neural network for factoid question answering over paragraphs
