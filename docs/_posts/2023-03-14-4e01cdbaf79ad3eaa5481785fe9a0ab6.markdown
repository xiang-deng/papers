High-speed link consisting of drivers and interconnects is essential for high-speed data transmission. In this article, a surrogate modeling technique based on graph neural network (GNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed for signal integrity (SI) analysis of high-speed links with variable physical parameters and variable topologies. First, GNN extracts global features that can fully characterize components of the high-speed link from their topologies and physical parameters  Cites: Introduction to Graph Neural Networks
