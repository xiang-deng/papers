Multi-document summarization (MDS) is an important branch of information aggregation. Compared with the single-document summary (SDS), MDS faces the problem of large search space, redundancy and complex cross-document relation. In this paper, we propose an abstractive MDS model based on Transformer, which considers the parallel information of documents with the graph attention network. During decoding, our model can utilize graph information to guide the summary  Cites: Data Augmentation for Abstractive Query-Focused Multi-Document
