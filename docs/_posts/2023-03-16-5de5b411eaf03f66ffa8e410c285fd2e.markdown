Relation classification is an important task in natural language processing, which aims to predict the semantic relation between a given entity pair in a sentence. There are datasets, like TACRED, that contain a large number of “no_relation” type samples. Most existing methods treat “no_relation” and normal relation types equally, and directly apply the softmax function over all relation types. In this paper, we propose a novel joint training network to learn more distinguishable relation features …
