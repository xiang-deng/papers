The exploration of self-supervised information mining of heterogeneous datasets has gained significant traction in recent years. Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a highly promising method for handling heterogeneous information networks (HINs) due to their superior performance. These networks leverage aggregation functions to convert pairwise relations-based features from raw heterogeneous graphs into embedding vectors. However, real-world HINs contain …
