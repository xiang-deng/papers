Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task for several important applications such as knowledge base construction and semantic search. So far, the focus has been on building machine learning models, which identify generic named entities (eg, person, date). Such models can be used off-the-shelf without requiring ground truth labels for training. However, such models cannot generalize to specialized domains that have domain-specific named entities (eg, the legal …
