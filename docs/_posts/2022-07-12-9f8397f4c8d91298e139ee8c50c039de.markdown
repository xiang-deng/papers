Spatial datasets are used extensively to train machine learning (ML) models for applications such as spatial regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning. Most of the real-world spatial datasets are often too large, and many spatial ML algorithms represent the geographical region as a grid consisting of several spatial cells. If the granularity of the grid is too fine, that results in a large number of grid cells leading to long training time and high memory consumption issues during the model  Cites: Visualization-aware sampling for very large databases
