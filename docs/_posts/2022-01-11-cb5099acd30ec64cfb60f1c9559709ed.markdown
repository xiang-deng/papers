Faults in train mechanical parts pose a significant safety hazard to railway transportation. Although some image detection methods have replaced manual fault detection of train mechanical parts, the detection effect on small mechanical parts under low illumination conditions is not ideal. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of the detection of train faults under different environments, we propose a multi-mode aggregation feature enhanced network (MAFENet) based on a single-stage detector Cites: Espnet: Efficient spatial pyramid of dilated convolutions for
