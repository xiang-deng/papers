Recently, knowledge graph reasoning has sparked great interest in research community, which aims at inferring missing information in triples and provides critical support to various tasks (eg, question answering and recommendation). To date, multi-hop reasoning is a dominant approach which infers the target answer by walking along the path connecting entities and relations, ensuring both accuracy and interpretability. However, in most knowledge graphs, there are multiple relations Cites: Convolutional 2d knowledge graph embeddings
