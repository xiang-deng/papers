With the success of large language models (LLMs) of code and their use as code assistants (eg Codex used in GitHub Copilot), techniques for introducing domain-specific knowledge in the prompt design process become important. In this work, we propose a framework called Repo-Level Prompt Generator that learns to generate example-specific prompts using a set of rules. These rules take context from the entire repository, thereby incorporating both the structure of the repository and the …
