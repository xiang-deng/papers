Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success across a wide range of natural language generation tasks, where proper prompt designs make great impacts. While existing prompting methods are normally restricted to providing correct information, in this paper, we encourage the model to deliberate by proposing a novel Deliberate then Generate (DTG) prompting framework, which consists of error detection instructions and candidates that may contain errors. DTG is a simple  Cites: Dictionary-based Phrase-level Prompting of Large Language
