Due to efficient end-to-end training and fluency in generated texts, several encoder- decoder framework-based models are recently proposed for data-to-text generations. Appropriate encoding of input data is a crucial part of such encoder-decoder models. However, only a few research works have concentrated on proper encoding methods. This paper presents a novel encoder-decoder based data-to-text generation model where the proposed encoder carefully encodes input data Cites: Table-to-text: Describing table region with natural language
