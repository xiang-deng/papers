Although large language models have achieved impressive zero-shot ability, the huge model size generally incurs high cost. Recently, semi-parametric language models, which augment a smaller language model with an external retriever, have demonstrated promising language modeling capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether such semi-parametric language models can perform competitively well as their fully-parametric counterparts on zero-shot generalization to downstream Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
