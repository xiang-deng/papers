Adapting a large language model for multiple-attribute text style transfer via fine-tuning can be challenging due to the significant amount of computational resources and labeled data required for the specific task. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing AdapterTST, a framework that freezes the pre-trained model s original parameters and enables the development of a multiple-attribute text style transfer model. Using BART as the backbone model, Adapter-TST utilizes Cites: Adapterhub: A framework for adapting transformers
