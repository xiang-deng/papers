Many experimental research designs offer participants the opportunity to chat with each other. While experimental research has traditionally treated text as process data, this paper proposes a novel approach to interpret and use chat data in a structured supervised classification task. Specifically, we provide a framework for supervised classification where chat text serves as input and a related numeric variable serves as the target to be predicted. We show that the combination of chat …
