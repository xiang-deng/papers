Understanding key insights from full-text scholarly articles is essential as it enables us to determine interesting trends, give insight into the research and development, and build knowledge graphs. However, some of the interesting key insights are only available when considering full-text. Although researchers have made significant progress in information extraction from short documents, extraction of scientific entities from full-text scholarly literature remains a challenging problem.
