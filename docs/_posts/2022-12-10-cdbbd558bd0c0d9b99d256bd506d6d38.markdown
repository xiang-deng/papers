Commonsense question answering (CQA) requires understanding and reasoning over QA context and related commonsense knowledge, such as a structured Knowledge Graph (KG). Existing studies combine language models and graph neural networks to model inference. However, traditional knowledge graph are mostly concept-based, ignoring direct path evidence necessary for accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose MRGNN (Meta-path Reasoning Graph Neural Cites: CommonsenseQA: A Question Answering Challenge Targeting
