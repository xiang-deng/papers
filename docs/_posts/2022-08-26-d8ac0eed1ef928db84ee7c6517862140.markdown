Labeled data are generally scarce in engineering practice, while data-driven methods fail to mine the correlations between samples to utilize the rich unlabeled data, so they cannot achieve satisfactory performance under limited labeled data. To address this problem, a semi-supervised multi-scale attention-aware graph convolution network (MSA-GCN) is proposed for fault diagnosis under extremely-limited labeled samples. First, available labeled data are transformed with unlabeled Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
