As unconventional sources of geoinformation, massive imagery and text messages from open platforms and social media form a temporally quasi-seamless, spatially multiperspective stream, but with unknown and diverse quality. Due to its complementarity to remote sensing (RS) data, geoinformation from these sources offers promising perspectives, but harvesting is not trivial due to its data characteristics. In this article, we address key aspects in the field, including data Cites: Deep Unordered Composition Rivals Syntactic Methods for Text
