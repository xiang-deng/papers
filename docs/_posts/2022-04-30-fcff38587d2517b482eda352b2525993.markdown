Image classification, which classifies images by pre-defined categories, has been the dominant approach to visual representation learning over the last decade. Visual learning through image-text alignment, however, has emerged to show promising performance, especially for zero-shot recognition. We believe that these two learning tasks are complementary, and suggest combining them for better visual learning. We propose a deep fusion method with three adaptations that effectively bridge two Cites: Contrastive learning of medical visual representations from paired
