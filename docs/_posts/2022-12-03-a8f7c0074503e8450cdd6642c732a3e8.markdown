Topic modelling is a popular unsupervised method for text corpora processing to obtain interpreted knowledge of the data. However, there is an automatic quality measurement gap between existing metrics, human evaluation and performance on the target tasks. That is a big challenge for automatic hyperparameter tuning methods as they heavily rely on the output signal to define the optimization direction. Currently, this process of evaluating the effectiveness of the topic model faces a  Cites: Is automated topic model evaluation broken? the incoherence of
