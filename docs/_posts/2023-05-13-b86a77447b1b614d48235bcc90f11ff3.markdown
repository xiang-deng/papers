Summarization aims at extracting the salient information from a document and presenting the extracted information in a condensed form. Most existing methods for extractive text summarization generate a summary from a document using a two-stage process. In the first stage, the sentences are ranked based on their saliency scores and, in the second stage, the summary generation process starts with the top-ranked sentence and selects the next sentences one by one from the ranked list. To …
