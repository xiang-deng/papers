Recently, source data-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) attracts increasing attention. Current work shows that the geometry of the target data is helpful to solving this challenging problem. However, these methods define the geometric structures in Euclidean space. The geometry cannot completely draw the semantic relationship between the target data distributed on a manifold. This article proposed a new SFUDA method, semantic consistency learning on manifold … Cites: ‪Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database‬
