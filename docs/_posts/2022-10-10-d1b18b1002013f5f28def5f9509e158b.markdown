Abstract Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various graph-related learning tasks. Due to the importance of safety in real-life applications, adversarial attacks and defenses on GNNs have attracted significant research attention. While the adversarial attacks successfully degrade GNNs  performance significantly, the internal mechanisms and theoretical properties of graph-based attacks remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we develop deeper …
