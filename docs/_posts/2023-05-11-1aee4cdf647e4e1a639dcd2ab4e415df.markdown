Visible modality and infrared modality person re-identification (VI-ReID) is an extremely important and challenging task. Existing works mainly focus on reducing the modality gap with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, the features extracted by CNN may contain useless identity-irrelevant information, which inevitably reduces the discrimination of features. To address this issue, this paper introduces a Top-K Visual Tokens Transformer (TVTR) framework which utilizes a top Cites: Memory-efficient Transformers via Top-$ k $ Attention
