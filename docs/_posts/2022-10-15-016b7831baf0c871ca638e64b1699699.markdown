We investigate semi-structured document classification in a zero-shot setting. Classification of semi-structured documents is more challenging than that of standard unstructured documents, as positional, layout, and style information play a vital role in interpreting such documents. The standard classification setting where categories are fixed during both training and testing falls short in dynamic environments where new document categories could potentially emerge. We focus exclusively on the zero  Cites: Label Semantics for Few Shot Named Entity Recognition
