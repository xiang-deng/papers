The union of Edge Computing (EC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought forward the Edge AI concept to provide intelligent solutions close to end-user environment, for privacy preservation, low latency to real-time performance, as well as resource optimization. Machine Learning (ML), as the most advanced branch of AI in the past few years, has shown encouraging results and applications in the edge environment. Nevertheless, edge powered ML solutions are more complex to realize …
