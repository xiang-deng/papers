Human language is full of compositional syntactic structures, and although neural networks have contributed to groundbreaking improvements in computer systems that process language, widely-used neural network architectures still exhibit limitations in their ability to process syntax. To address this issue, prior work has proposed adding stack data structures to neural networks, drawing inspiration from theoretical connections between syntax and stacks. However, these methods employ …
