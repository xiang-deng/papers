We define a novel concept called extended word alignment in order to improve post-editing assistance efficiency. Based on extended word alignment, we further propose a novel task called refined word-level QE that outputs refined tags and word-level correspondences. Compared to original word-level QE, the new task is able to directly point out editing operations, thus improves efficiency. To extract extended word alignment, we adopt a supervised method based on mBERT. To solve refined Cites: Word Alignment by Fine-tuning Embeddings on Parallel Corpora
