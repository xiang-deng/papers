Detecting bugs in Deep Learning (DL) libraries is critical for almost all downstream DL systems in ensuring effectiveness and safety for the end users. As such, researchers have started developing various fuzzing or testing techniques targeting DL libraries. Previous work can be mainly classified into API-level fuzzing and model-level fuzzing. However, both types of techniques cannot detect bugs that can only be exposed by complex API sequences-API-level fuzzers cannot cover API sequences …
