Intramolecular charge migration plays a key role in photochemical reactions of biorelevant molecules. This work combines ultrashort free-electron laser soft x-ray pulses with a kinematically complete pump-probe absorption measurement in order to monitor electronic and nuclear wave packet dynamics. The Free-Electron LASer in Hamburg (FLASH) at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY is capable of producing single-mode Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) radiation with …
