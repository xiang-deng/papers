Formally verifying software properties is a highly desirable but labor-intensive task. Recent work has developed methods to automate formal verification using proof assistants, such as Coq and Isabelle/HOL, eg, by training a model to predict one proof step at a time, and using that model to search through the space of possible proofs. This paper introduces a new method to automate formal verification: We use large language models, trained on natural language text and code and fine-tuned on Cites: Break-it-fix-it: Unsupervised learning for program repair
