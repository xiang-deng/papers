Academic knowledge graphs are essential resources and can be beneficial in widespread real-world applications. Most of the existing academic knowledge graphs are far from completion; thus, knowledge graph completion—the task of extending a knowledge graph with missing entities and relations—attracts many researchers. Most existing methods utilize low-dimensional embeddings to represent entities and relations and follow the discrimination paradigm for link prediction …
