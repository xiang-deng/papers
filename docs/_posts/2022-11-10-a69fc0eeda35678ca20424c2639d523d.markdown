Neural networks trained with ERM (empirical risk minimization) sometimes learn unintended decision rules, in particular when their training data is biased, ie, when training labels are strongly correlated with undesirable features. To prevent a network from learning such features, recent methods augment training data such that examples displaying spurious correlations (ie, bias-aligned examples) become a minority, whereas the other, bias-conflicting examples become prevalent.
