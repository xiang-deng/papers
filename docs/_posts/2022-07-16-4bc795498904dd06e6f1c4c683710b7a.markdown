Point cloud completion aims to predict complete shape from its partial observation. Current approaches mainly consist of generation and refinement stages in a coarse-to-fine style. However, the generation stage often lacks robustness to tackle different incomplete variations, while the refinement stage blindly recovers point clouds without the semantic awareness. To tackle these challenges, we unify point cloud Completion by a generic Pretrain-Prompt-Predict paradigm, namely CP3. Inspired by …
