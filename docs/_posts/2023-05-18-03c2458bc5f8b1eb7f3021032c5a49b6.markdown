The pseudocode-to-code task has two main stages: code translation and search synthesis. It faces two main challenges: First, the generated candidate code pieces need to be more accurate. Second, there are problems with search efficiency and accuracy. To address the above challenges, this work proposes a novel approach: For the encoder of code translation, a new multi-scale pyramid feature extractor is proposed to obtain multi-scale local information, which is combined with the global Cites: Coarse-to-fine decoding for neural semantic parsing
