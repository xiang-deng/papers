Machine commonsense reasoning (MCR) systems can significantly improve the way we interact with machines. MCR systems are therefore an important element in any human-centric applications. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have enabled breakthroughs in MCR technologies. This paper aims to improve healthcare outcomes by making human-machine interactions more intuitive than before. It presents learning models developed for MCR. Specifically, it presents a critical Cites: Joint learning of question answering and question generation
