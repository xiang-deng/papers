While deep learning has achieved great success on various tasks, the task-specific model training notoriously relies on a large volume of labeled data. Recently, a new training paradigm of``pre-train, prompt, predict  has been proposed to improve model generalization ability with limited labeled data. The main idea is that, based on a pre-trained model, the prompting function uses a template to augment input samples with indicative context and reformalizes the target task to one of the pre-training tasks. In …
