Event detection (ED) is aimed to identify the key trigger words in unstructured text and predict the event types accordingly. Traditional ED models are too data-hungry to accommodate real applications with scarce labeled data. Besides, typical ED models are facing the context-bypassing and disabled generalization issues caused by the trigger bias stemming from ED datasets. Therefore, we focus on the true few-shot paradigm to satisfy the low-resource scenarios. In particular, we propose a multi  Cites: True few-shot learning with language models
