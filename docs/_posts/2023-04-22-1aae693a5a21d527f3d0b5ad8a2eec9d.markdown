Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach to model and draw inferences from large scale graph-structured data in various application settings such as social networking. The primary goal of a GNN is to learn an embedding for each graph node in a dataset that encodes both the node features and the local graph structure around the node. Embeddings generated by a GNN for a graph node are unique to that GNN. Prior work has shown that GNNs are prone to  Cites: Thieves on Sesame Street! Model Extraction of BERT-based APIs
