Real-world recommender systems usually consist of two phases. Predictive models in Phase I provide accurate predictions of users actions on items, and Phase II is to aggregate the predictions with strategic parameters to make final recommendations, which aim to meet multiple business goals, such as maximizing users like rate and average engagement time. Though it is important to generate accurate predictions in Phase I, it is also crucial to optimize the strategic parameters in Phase II  Cites: Multiobjective pareto-efficient approaches for recommender systems
