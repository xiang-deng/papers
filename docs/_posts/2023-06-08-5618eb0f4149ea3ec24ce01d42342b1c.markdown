In order to mitigate some of the inefficiencies of Reinforcement Learning (RL), modular approaches composing different decision-making policies to derive agents capable of performing a variety of tasks have been proposed. The modules at the basis of these architectures are generally reusable, also allowing for plug-and-play integration. However, such solutions still lack the ability to process and integrate multiple types of information (knowledge), such as rules, sub-goals, and skills.
