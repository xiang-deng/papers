The continued advances in artificial intelligence (AI), including those in machine learning (ML), raise concerns regarding their deployment in high-risk and safety-critical domains. Motivated by these concerns, there have been calls for the verification of systems of AI, including their explanation. Nevertheless, tools for the verification of systems of AI are complex, and so error-prone. This paper describes one initial effort towards the certification of logic-based explainability algorithms Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
