Short text classification task is a special kind of text classification task in that the text to be classified is generally short, typically generating a sparse text representation that lacks rich semantic information. Given this shortcoming, scholars worldwide have explored improved short text classification methods based on deep learning. However, existing methods cannot effectively use concept knowledge and long-distance word dependencies. Therefore, based on graph neural networks from the
