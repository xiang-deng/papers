This chapter comprises four sections and is dedicated to wafer-level failure pattern analytics. Each section is based on a particular perspective toward the analytics problem. In the first section, the application is about early detection of yield excursions. The goal is to automatically recognize the existence of a systematic failure cluster on wafers coming in batches. Traditional machine learning techniques are used in tackling the problem (Sumikawa et al., IEEE International Test  Cites: Break It Down: A Question Understanding Benchmark
