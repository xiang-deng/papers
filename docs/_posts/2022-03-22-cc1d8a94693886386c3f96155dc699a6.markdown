The mainstream machine learning paradigms for NLP often work with two underlying presumptions. First, the target task is predefined and static, a system just needs to learn to solve it exclusively. Second, the supervision of a task mainly comes from a set of labeled examples. A question arises: how to build a system that can keep learning new tasks from their instructions? This work defines a new learning paradigm ConTinTin (Continual Learning from Task Instructions), in which a system Cites: Cross-task generalization via natural language crowdsourcing
