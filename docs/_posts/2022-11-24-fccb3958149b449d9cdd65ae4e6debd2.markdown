We introduce GENIUS: a conditional text generation model using sketches as input, which can fill in the missing contexts for a given sketch (key information consisting of textual spans, phrases, or words, concatenated by mask tokens). GENIUS is pre-trained on a large-scale textual corpus with a novel reconstruction from sketch objective using an extreme and selective masking strategy, enabling it to generate diverse and high-quality texts given sketches. Comparison with other competitive …
