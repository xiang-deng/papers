Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict a user s next interacted item given his/her historical interactions. Most existing sequential recommendation systems model user preferences only with item-level representations, where a user s interaction sequence are often modeled with sequential or graph-based method to infer the user s sequential interaction pattern. However, since a user s preference factors may vary over time, the user modeling on item-level could hardly represent …
