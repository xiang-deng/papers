Over the last few years there has been an increasing number of papers using machine learning (ML) as a tool to aid research directed towards perovskite solar cells. This review provides an overview of this recent development with a focus on the type of questions and narratives being explored, which type of data that may be useful, and how to extract relevant features for training ML models. Key areas being discussed include how to make better sense of experimental data, how to automate  Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
