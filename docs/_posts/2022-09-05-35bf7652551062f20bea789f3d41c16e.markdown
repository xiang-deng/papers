Current evidence indicates that the semantic representation of question and answer sentences is better generated by deep neural network-based sentence models than traditional methods in community answer selection tasks. In particular, as a widely recognized language model, the self-attention model computes the similarity between the specific word and the whole sets of words in the same sentence and generates new semantic representation through the similarity-weighted summation  Cites: WikiQA: A challenge dataset for open-domain question answering
