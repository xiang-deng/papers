Clinical risk prediction based on Electronic Health Records (EHR) can assist doctors in better judgment and can make sense of early diagnosis. However, the prediction performance heavily relies on effective representations from multi-dimensional time-series EHR data. Existing solutions usually focus on temporal features or inherent relations between clinical event variables or extract both information in two separate phases. This usually leads to insufficient patient feature information and results in …
