Existing unsupervised keyphrase extraction methods typically emphasize the importance of the candidate keyphrase itself, ignoring other important factors such as the influence of uninformative sentences. We hypothesize that the salient sentences of a document are particularly important as they are most likely to contain keyphrases, especially for long documents. To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to exploit sentence salience for unsupervised keyphrase extraction by  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
