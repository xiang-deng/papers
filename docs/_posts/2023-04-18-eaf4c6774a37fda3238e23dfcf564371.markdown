In this study, we propose a novel approach for automating antenna design through the utilization of domain knowledge-informed reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL). The proposed method allows the RL agent to learn from its interactions with the environment and to take actions that maximize the reward signal, resulting in the optimal policy. Despite the attractive advantages, the learning process of RL can be challenging and time-consuming, as the agent must explore a  Cites: A graph placement methodology for fast chip design
