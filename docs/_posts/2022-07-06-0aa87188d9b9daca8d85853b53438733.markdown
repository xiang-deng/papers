Molecular dynamics simulations accelerated by high-performance computing methods are powerful tools for investigating and extracting the microscopic mechanisms characterizing the properties of a wide range of materials, including soft matter. Generally, the runtimes for these simulations range from hours to days to furnish accurate information using optimal parallelization techniques. These simulations produce enormous amounts of data that can guide the design and  Cites: Dropout training as adaptive regularization
