Event representation aims to transform individual events from a narrative event chain into a set of low-dimensional vectors to help support a series of downstream applications, eg, similarity differentiation and missing event prediction. Traditional event representation models tend to focus on single modeling perspectives and thus are incapable of capturing physically disconnected yet semantically connected event segments. We, therefore, propose a heterogeneous event graph model (HeterEvent)  Cites: Atomic: An atlas of machine commonsense for if-then reasoning
