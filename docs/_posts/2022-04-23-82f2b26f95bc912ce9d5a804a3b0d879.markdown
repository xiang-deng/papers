We compare various forms of prompts to represent event types and develop a unified framework to incorporate the event type specific prompts for supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot event detection. The experimental results demonstrate that a well- defined and comprehensive event type prompt can significantly improve the performance of event detection, especially when the annotated data is scarce (few- shot event detection) or not available (zero-shot event detection).
