We propose synperiodic filter banks, a novel multi-scale learnable filter bank construction strategy that all filters are synchronized by their rotating periodicity. By synchronizing in a certain periodicity, we naturally get filters whose temporal length are reduced if they carry higher frequency response, and vice versa. Such filters internally maintain a better time-frequency resolution trade-off. By further alternating the periodicity, we can easily obtain a group of synperiodic filter bank (we call  Cites: Empirical evaluation of gated recurrent neural networks on
