Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become effective knowledge resources in diverse applications, and knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods have attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, it s still challenging for conventional KGE methods to handle unseen entities or relations during the model test. Much effort has been made in various fields of KGs to address this problem. In this paper, we use a set of general terminologies to unify these methods and refer to them as …
