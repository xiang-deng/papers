Word embedding representations generated by neural language models encode rich information about language and the world. In this thesis, we investigate the knowledge about word meaning encoded in embedding representations and propose methods to automatically enhance their quality. Our main focus is on contextual models which generate representations that capture the meaning of word usages in new contexts. These models have dominated the NLP and Computational Cites: Dissecting contextual word embeddings: Architecture and
