Skeleton-based human action recognition has attracted considerable attention and achieved great success in several engineering fields, which is also one of the most active research topic in computer vision community. However, the existing methods may suffer from a large model size and slow execution speed. In addition, some useful information embedded in skeleton sequence, such as the motion information with different scales, had not been fully utilized, such that the performance of …
