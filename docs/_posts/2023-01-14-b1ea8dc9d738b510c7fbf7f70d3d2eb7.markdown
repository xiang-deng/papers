Periodic gratings utilized as emitters increase the efficiency of thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems. These gratings work by altering the emittance spectrum incident on the photovoltaic cell to better match the band gap of the cell. Photons at slightly higher energies than the band gap are the most efficient as they generate electron-hole pairs while minimizing thermalization losses. This prompts the use of gratings to be used as selective emitters. Even for a one-dimensional (1D) grating, millions of …
