Place names embedded in online natural language text present a useful source of geographic information. Despite this, many methods for the extraction of place names from text use pre-trained models that were not explicitly designed for this task. Our paper builds five custom-built Named Entity Recognition (NER) models and evaluates them against three popular pre-built models for place name extraction. The models are evaluated using a set of manually annotated Wikipedia articles with  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
