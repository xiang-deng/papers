Aiming at the problems of high spatial and temporal dispersion, strong quality uncertainty and weak cross-organizational information correlation in the recycling of decommissioned electromechanical products, this paper proposes a knowledge graph-based method for tracing the full life cycle information of decommissioned electromechanical products. First, the structure of the knowledge graph of the full life cycle information of decommissioned electromechanical products is constructed Cites: End-to-end Neural Coreference Resolution
