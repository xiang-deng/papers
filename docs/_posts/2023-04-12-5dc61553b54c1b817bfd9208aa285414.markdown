In deep learning, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) have once again garnered attention from researchers. This paper introduces MC-MLP, a general MLP-like backbone for computer vision that is composed of a series of fully-connected (FC) layers. In MC-MLP, we propose that the same semantic information has varying levels of difficulty in learning, depending on the coordinate frame of features. To address this, we perform an orthogonal transform on the feature information Cites: Delight: Deep and light-weight transformer
