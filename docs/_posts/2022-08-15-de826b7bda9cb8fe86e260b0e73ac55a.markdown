Recent advance in Dense Retrieval (DR) techniques has significantly improved the effectiveness of first-stage retrieval. Trained with large-scale supervised data, DR models can encode queries and documents into a low-dimensional dense space and conduct effective semantic matching. However, previous studies have shown that the effectiveness of DR models would drop by a large margin when the trained DR models are adopted in a target domain that is different from the domain of the Cites: Towards a unified view of parameter-efficient transfer learning
