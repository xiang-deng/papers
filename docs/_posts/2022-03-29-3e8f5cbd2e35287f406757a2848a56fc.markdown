Transformers have recently been shown to be capable of reliably performing logical reasoning over facts and rules expressed in natural language, but abductive reasoning-inference to the best explanation of an unexpected observation-has been underexplored despite significant applications to scientific discovery, common-sense reasoning, and model interpretability. We present AbductionRules, a group of natural language datasets designed to train and test generalisable abduction over natural Cites: Naturalproofs: Mathematical theorem proving in natural language
