Different from sentence-level sentiment analysis, the aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained task that aims to identify the sentiment polarity towards specific aspect terms in a sentence. However, the lack of fine-grained labeled data and the fact that a sentence may contain multiple aspects or complex implicit sentiment relations make ABSA still face challenges. Specifically, effectively exploiting syntactic dependencies to construct contextual information in a sentence …
