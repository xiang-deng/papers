Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) representation learning aims to project entities and relations in TKGs to a low-dimensional vector space while preserving the evolutionary nature of TKGs. Most existing methods treat knowledge that happens at different times separately, which fails to explore how temporal knowledge graphs evolve over time. Actually, TKGs should evolve both on the local and global structures. The local structure evolution describes the formation process of the graph …
