Flood forecasting is among the most important precaution measures to prevent devastating disasters affecting human life, properties, and the overall environment. It is closely involved with precipitation and streamflow data forecasting tasks. In this work, we introduced a multi-step discharge prediction framework based on deep learning models. A simple feature representation technique using a correlation of backward lags was enhanced with a time of concentration (TC) concept. Recurrent …
