Graph attention network (GAT) is a promising framework for message passing on graphs, but how to exploit rich, high-order structural information in the attention mechanism is still an open challenge. Furthermore, increasing the attention range to more than one-hop neighbors can negatively affect the performance of GAT, reflecting the over-smoothing risk of graph neural networks in general. In this paper, we propose an adaptive structural fingerprint model to fully exploit complex graph Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
