This paper presents a solution to the challenge of mitigating carbon emissions from large-scale high performance computing (HPC) systems and datacenters that host machine learning (ML) inference services. ML inference is critical to modern technology products, but it is also a significant contributor to datacenter compute cycles and carbon emissions. We introduce Clover, a carbon-friendly ML inference service runtime system that balances performance, accuracy, and carbon emissions …
