Generative Language Models (GLMs) have demonstrated capabilities to store factual knowledge and answer queries efficiently. Given varying prompts, does a GLM consistently generate factually correct answers? In this paper, we introduce a statistical knowledge assessment framework guided by latent variables and the KaRR metric, which quantifies a model s knowledge by computing its continuous probability across diverse text forms. We conduct a comprehensive comparison of …
