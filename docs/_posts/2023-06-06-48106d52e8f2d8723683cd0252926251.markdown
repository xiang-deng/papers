Large Language models (LLMs) can be induced to solve non-trivial problems with few-shot prompts including illustrative problem-solution examples. Now if the few-shots also include chain of thought (CoT) explanations, which are of the form problem-explanation-solution, LLMs will generate a explained solution, and perform even better. Recently an exciting, substantially better technique, self-consistency [1](SC) has emerged, based on the intuition that there are many  Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
