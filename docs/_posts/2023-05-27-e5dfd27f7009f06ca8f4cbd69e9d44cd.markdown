Recently, a new paradigm called Differentiable Search Index (DSI) has been proposed for document retrieval, wherein a sequence-to-sequence model is learned to directly map queries to relevant document identifiers. The key idea behind DSI is to fully parameterize traditional``index-retrieve pipelines within a single neural model, by encoding all documents in the corpus into the model parameters. In essence, DSI needs to resolve two major questions:(1) how to assign an identifier to Cites: Sparse, dense, and attentional representations for text retrieval
