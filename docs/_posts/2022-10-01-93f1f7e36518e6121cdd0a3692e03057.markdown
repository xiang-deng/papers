Multi-view subspace clustering achieves impressive performance for high-dimensional data. However, many of these models do not sufficiently mine the intrinsic information among samples and consider the robustness problem of the affinity matrices, resulting in the degradation of clustering performance. To address these problems, we propose a novel high-order manifold regularized multi-view subspace clustering with robust affinity matrices and a weighted tensor nuclear norm  Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
