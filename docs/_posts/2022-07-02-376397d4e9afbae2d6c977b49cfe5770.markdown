In plants, vascular development is a dynamic process that integrates extrinsic and intrinsic factors. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), SHORTROOT (SHR) has been known to play key roles in regulating cell division and differentiation in root vascular development. However, the role of SHR in the shoot vasculature remains unknown. Here, we employed various experimental approaches to unravel SHR s role in shoot vascular development. In hypocotyls and inflorescence stems, shr Cites: BRL1 and BRL3 are novel brassinosteroid receptors that function
