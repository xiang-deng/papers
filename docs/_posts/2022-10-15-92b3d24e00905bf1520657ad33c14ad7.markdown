Recently, with the rapid developments of the Internet and social networks, there have been tremendous increase in the amount of complex-structured text resources. These information explosions require extensive studies as well as more advanced methods in order to better understand and effectively model/learn these high-dimensional/structure-complicated textual datasets. Moving along with the recent progresses in deep learning and textual representation learning approaches, many  Cites: Exploring and predicting transferability across nlp tasks
