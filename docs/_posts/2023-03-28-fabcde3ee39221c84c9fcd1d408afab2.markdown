Recent developments in deep learning have shown significant improvement in the accuracy of acoustic impedance inversion results. However, the conventional gradient-based optimizers such as the root-mean-square propagation, the momentum, the adaptive moment estimation (ADAM), etc., used in the deep learning framework, inherently tend to converge at the nearest optimum point, thereby compromising the solution by not attaining the global minimum.
