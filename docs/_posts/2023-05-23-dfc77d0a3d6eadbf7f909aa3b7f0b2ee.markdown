Feature attribution methods (FAs) are popular approaches for providing insights into the model reasoning process of making predictions. The more faithful a FA is, the more accurately it reflects which parts of the input are more important for the prediction. Widely used faithfulness metrics, such as sufficiency and comprehensiveness use a hard erasure criterion, ie entirely removing or retaining the top most important tokens ranked by a given FA and observing the changes in Cites: Connecting Attributions and QA Model Behavior on Realistic
