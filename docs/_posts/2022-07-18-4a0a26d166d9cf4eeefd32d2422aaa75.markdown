This paper investigates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) application for self-supervised network intrusion and anomaly detection. GNNs are a deep learning approach for graph-based data that incorporate graph structures into learning to generalise graph representations and output embeddings. As network flows are naturally graph-based, GNNs are a suitable fit for analysing and learning network behaviour. The majority of current implementations of GNN-based Network Intrusion …
