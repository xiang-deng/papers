Neural models of code are successfully tackling various prediction tasks, complementing and sometimes even outperforming traditional program analyses. While most work focuses on end-to-end evaluations of such models, it often remains unclear what the models actually learn, and to what extent their reasoning about code matches that of skilled humans. A poor understanding of the model reasoning risks deploying models that are right for the wrong reason, and taking decisions Cites: Dawn Drain
