Deep learning models have been widely used in source code processing tasks, such as code captioning, code summarization, code completion, and code classification. Recent studies have shown that deep learning-based source code processing models are vulnerable. Attackers can generate adversarial examples by adding perturbations to source programs. Existing attack methods perturb a source program by renaming one or multiple variables in the program. These attack methods do not Cites: Learning to mine aligned code and natural language pairs from
