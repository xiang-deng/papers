In this paper, an Adaptive Fusion Transformer (AFT) is proposed for unsupervised pixel-level fusion of visible and infrared images. Different from the existing convolutional networks, transformer is adopted to model the relationship of multi-modality images and explore cross-modal interactions in AFT. The encoder of AFT uses a Multi-Head Self-attention (MSA) module and Feed Forward (FF) network for feature extraction. Then, a Multi-head Self-Fusion (MSF) module is designed for the …
