The recent success of neural networks in NLP applications has provided a strong impetus to develop supervised models for semantic role labeling which forego the requirement for extensive feature engineering. Recent state-of-the-art approaches require high quality annotated datasets that are costly to obtain and almost unavailable for low resource languages. We present a semi-supervised approach that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data to provide performance improvement …
