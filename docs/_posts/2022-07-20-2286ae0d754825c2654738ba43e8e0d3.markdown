Abstract One-vs-Rest (OVR) classification aims to distinguish a single class of interest (COI) from other classes. The concept of novelty detection and robustness to dataset shift becomes crucial in OVR when the scope of the rest class is extended from the classes observed during training to unseen and possibly unrelated classes, a setting referred to as open set recognition (OSR). In this work, we propose a novel architecture, namely decoupling autoencoder (DAE), which provides a proven upper  Cites: Learning question classifiers
