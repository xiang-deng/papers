Social recommendations utilize social relations to enhance the representation learning for recommendations. Most social recommendation models unify user representations for the user-item interactions (collaborative domain) and social relations (social domain). However, such an approach may fail to model the users heterogeneous behavior patterns in two domains, impairing the expressiveness of user representations. In this work, to address such limitation, we propose a novel Cites: Recommender systems with social regularization
