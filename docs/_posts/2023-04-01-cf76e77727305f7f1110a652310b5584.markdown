Multi-hop question answering aims to predict answers to questions and generate supporting facts for answers by reasoning over the content of multiple documents. The recently proposed Semantic Role Labeling Graph Reasoning Network (SRLGRN) has achieved excellent performance on multi-hop QA tasks. However, SRLGRN is lacking in modelling the textual relationships, which are import cues for reasoning. To this end, this paper proposes an enhanced SRLGRN multi-hop Cites: Unsupervised question decomposition for question answering
