The concept of near-form words has existed since the ancient English period (about 450 years ago), yet few mathematical identification algorithms have been applied to these. With the widespread use of English and an increasing number of English words, near-form words have also increased. However, the traditional way of identifying near-form words cannot keep up with this ever-growing language. A mathematical algorithm is therefore needed which can calculate the degree of Cites: Word n-gram attention models for sentence similarity and inference
