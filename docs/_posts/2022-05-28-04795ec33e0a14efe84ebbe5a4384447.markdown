Recent years have witnessed the emerging success of leveraging syntax graphs for the target sentiment classification task. However, we discover that existing syntax-based models suffer from two issues: noisy information aggregation and loss of distant correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel model termed Neural Subgraph Explorer, which (1) reduces the noisy information via pruning target-irrelevant nodes on the syntax graph;(2) introduces beneficial first-order connections  Cites: Effective LSTMs for target-dependent sentiment classification
