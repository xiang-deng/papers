Modern engineered systems are immensely complex. Extensive sets of natural language requirements guide the development of such systems. As such, tools to assist system engineers in managing and extracting information from these requirements must also scale to match the complexity of these systems. However, the systems engineering community has lagged in adopting advanced natural language processing techniques. Pre-trained language models, such as BERT, represent state …
