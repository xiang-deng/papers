Transitions between geological/geotechnical soil units have a critical impact on the operation and performance of a tunnel boring machine (TBM). Geostatistics-based probabilistic modeling is used to quantify the uncertainty in soil transition locations. This paper presents two unique soft-ground tunneling case studies where the results from the geostatistics-based probabilistic modeling are compared to the TBM data and as-encountered ground conditions derived from the actual TBM data.
