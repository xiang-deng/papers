Recently, large language models for code generation have achieved breakthroughs in several programming language tasks. Their advances in competition-level programming problems have made them an emerging pillar in AI-assisted pair programming. Tools such as GitHub Copilot are already part of the daily programming workflow and are used by more than a million developers. The training data for these models is usually collected from open-source repositories (eg, GitHub) …
