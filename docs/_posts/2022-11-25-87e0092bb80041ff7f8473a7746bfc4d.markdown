Teaching machines to understand human language is one of the most elusive challenges in artificial intelligence. Machine reading comprehension is a crucial task in evaluating how computer systems understand natural language. This study presents a machine reading comprehension model based on external knowledge. We use a framework named K-Adapter to infuse two kinds of external knowledge with two specific adapters. This model can capture richer semantic information, which  Cites: K-adapter: Infusing knowledge into pre-trained models with adapters
