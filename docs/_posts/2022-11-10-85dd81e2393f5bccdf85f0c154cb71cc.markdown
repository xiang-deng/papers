The task of Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is to recognize images of novel state-object compositions that are absent during the training stage. Previous methods of learning compositional embedding have shown effectiveness in closed-world CZSL. However, in Open-World CZSL (OW-CZSL), their performance tends to degrade significantly due to the large cardinality of possible compositions. Some recent works separately predict simple primitives (ie, states and objects) to reduce  Cites: GQA: A new dataset for real-world visual reasoning and
