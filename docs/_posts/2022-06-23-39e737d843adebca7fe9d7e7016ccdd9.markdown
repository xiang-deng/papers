Similarity searches on heterogeneous information networks (HINs) have attracted wide attention from both industrial and academic areas in recent years; for example, they have been used for friend detection in social networks and collaborator recommendation in coauthor networks. The structural information on the HIN can be captured by multiple metapaths, and people usually utilize metapaths to design methods for similarity search. The rich semantics in HINs are not only structural
