Training of Machine Learning (ML) models in real contexts often deals with big data sets and high-class imbalance samples where the class of interest is unrepresented (minority class). Practical solutions using classical ML models address the problem of large data sets using parallel/distributed implementations of training algorithms, approximate model-based solutions, or applying instance selection (IS) algorithms to eliminate redundant information. However, the combined problem of big and high …
