In conversational question answering, users express their information needs through a series of utterances with incomplete context. Typical ConvQA methods rely on a single source (a knowledge base (KB), or a text corpus, or a set of tables), thus being unable to benefit from increased answer coverage and redundancy of multiple sources. Our method Explaignn overcomes these limitations by integrating information from a mixture of sources with usercomprehensible explanations for Cites: Multi-task learning for conversational question answering over a
