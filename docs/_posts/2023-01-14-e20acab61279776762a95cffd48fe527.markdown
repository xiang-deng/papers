This dissertation proposes a framework of user-centered security in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and demonstrates how it can improve the accessibility of related research. Accordingly, it focuses on two security domains within NLP with great public interest. First, that of author profiling, which can be employed to compromise online privacy through invasive inferences. Without access and detailed insight into these models  predictions, there is no reasonable heuristic by which …
