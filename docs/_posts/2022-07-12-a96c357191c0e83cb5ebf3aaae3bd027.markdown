An entity linking system links named entities in a text to their corresponding entries in a knowledge base. In recent years, building an entity linking system that leverages the transformer architecture has gained lots of attention. However, deploying a transformer-based neural entity linking system in industrial production environments in a limited resource setting is a challenging task. In this work, we present an entity linking system that leverages a transformer-based BERT encoder (the BLINK model) …
