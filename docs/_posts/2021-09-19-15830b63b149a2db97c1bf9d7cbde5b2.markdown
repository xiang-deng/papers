Automata processing is an efficient computation model for regular expressions and other forms of sophisticated pattern matching. The demand for high-throughput and real-time pattern matching in many applications, including network intrusion detection and spam filters, has motivated several in-memory architectures for automata processing. Existing in-memory architectures focus on accelerating the pattern-matching kernel, but either fail to support a practical reporting solution or Cites: HARE: Hardware accelerator for regular expressions
