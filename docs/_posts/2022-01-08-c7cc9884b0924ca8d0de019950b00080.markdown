To enhance research on multimodal knowledge base and multimodal information processing, we propose a new task called multimodal entity tagging (MET) with a multimodal knowledge base (MKB). We also develop a dataset for the problem using an existing MKB. In an MKB, there are entities and their associated texts and images. In MET, given a text-image pair, one uses the information in the MKB to automatically identify the related entity in the text-image pair. We solve the task by using the Cites: VisualSem: a high-quality knowledge graph for vision and language
