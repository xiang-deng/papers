An increasing number of machine learning models have been deployed in domains with high stakes such as finance and healthcare. Despite their superior performances, many models are black boxes in nature which are hard to explain. There are growing efforts for researchers to develop methods to interpret these black- box models. Post hoc explanations based on perturbations, such as LIME, are widely used approaches to interpret a machine learning model after it has been built.
