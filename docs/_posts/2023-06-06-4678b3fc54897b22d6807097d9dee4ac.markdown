Existing deepfake detection methods fail to generalize well to unseen or degraded samples, which can be attributed to the over-fitting of low-level forgery patterns. Here we argue that high-level semantics are also indispensable recipes for generalizable forgery detection. Recently, large pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown promising generalization capability. In this paper, we propose the first parameter-efficient tuning approach for deepfake detection, namely DeepFake-Adapter, to Cites: Towards a unified view of parameter-efficient transfer learning
