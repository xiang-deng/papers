Paraphrase generation has consistently been a challenging area in the field of NLP. Despite the considerable achievements made by previous research, existing supervised approaches require many annotated paraphrase pairs which are expensive to collect. On the other hand, unsupervised paraphrasing manners usually generate syntactically similar output compared with the source text and lack diversity in grammatical structure. To tangle this challenge, we propose a Transformer-based Cites: Adversarial example generation with syntactically controlled
