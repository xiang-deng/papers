Deep learning technologies recently received much attention to detect vulnerable code patterns accurately. This paper proposes a new deep learning-based vulnerability detection tool dubbed VulDeBERT by fine-tuning a pre-trained language model, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), on the vulnerable code dataset. To support VulDeBERT, we develop a new code analysis tool to extract well-represented abstract code fragments from C and C++ …
