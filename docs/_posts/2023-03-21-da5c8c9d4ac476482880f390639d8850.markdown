Data representation plays a crucial role in natural language processing (NLP), forming the foundation for most NLP tasks. Indeed, NLP performance highly depends upon the effectiveness of the preprocessing pipeline that builds the data representation. Many representation learning frameworks, such as Word2Vec, encode input data based on local contextual information that interconnects words. Such approaches can be computationally intensive, and their encoding is hard to  Cites: Is Attention Interpretable?
