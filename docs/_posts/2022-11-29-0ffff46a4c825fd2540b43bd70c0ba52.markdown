Numerous papers get published all the time. However, some papers are born to be well-cited while others are not. In this work, we revisit the important problem of citation prediction, by focusing on the important yet realistic prediction on the average number of citations a paper will attract per year. The task is nonetheless challenging because many correlated factors underlie the potential impact of a paper, such as the prestige of its authors, the authority of its publishing venue, and  Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
