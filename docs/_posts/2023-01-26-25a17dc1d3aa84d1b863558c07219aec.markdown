Sentence ordering aims at restoring orders of shuffled sentences in a paragraph. Previous methods usually predict orders in a single direction, ie, from head to tail. However, unidirectional prediction inevitably causes error accumulation, which restricts performance. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional ordering method, which predicts orders in both head-to-tail and tail-to-head directions at the same time. In our bidirectional ordering method, two directions can interact with each other Cites: Inducing document plans for concept-to-text generation
