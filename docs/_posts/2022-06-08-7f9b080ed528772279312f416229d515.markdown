Advances in brain imaging have led to the generation of new kinds of datasets. The novel structures of these datasets necessitate development of new modeling paradigms for analysis better suited to this domain. This work is composed of different projects that propose novel statistical methods for analyzing brain data and other kinds of networks, which are described below.
