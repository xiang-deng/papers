Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used in many fields due to their powerful representation learning capabilities. However, they are exposed to serious threats caused by the increasing security issues. Adversarial examples were early discovered in computer vision (CV) field when the models were fooled by perturbing the original inputs, and they also exist in natural language processing (NLP) community. However, unlike the image, the text is discrete and semantic in nature Cites: Adversarially regularising neural NLI models to integrate logical
