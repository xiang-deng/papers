This study outlines the design and implementation of a cloud-based solution for real-time computer vision applications using an attention-based model known as a vision transformer. This study addresses the optimization of the solution by exploring optimal cloud components and vision transformer models to maintain or improve modeling performance while reducing the inference latency. First, the cloud components are investigated to explore the possibility of optimizing such …
