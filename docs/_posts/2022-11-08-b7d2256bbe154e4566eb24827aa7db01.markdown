This paper proposes a method for Named-Entity Recognition (NER) for a low-resource language, Tigrinya, using a pre-trained language model. Tigrinya is a morphologically rich, although one of the underrepresented in the field of NLP. This is mainly due to the limited amount of annotated data available. To address this problem, we present the first publicly available datasets of NER for Tigrinya containing two versions, namely,(V1 and V2) annotated manually. The V1 and V2 Cites: MasakhaNER: Named Entity Recognition for African Languages
