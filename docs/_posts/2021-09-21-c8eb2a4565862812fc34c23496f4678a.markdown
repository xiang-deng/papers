The long-tail latency problem is a well-known problem in large-scale system topologies like cloud platforms. Long-tail latency can lead to less predictable system performance, degraded quality of experience and potential economic loss. Previous research has focused on coarse-grained, symptomatic treatments like redundant request executions to mitigate tail latency and its effects. Instead, we propose studying these performance bugs systematically and addressing their underlying root Cites: Webtables: exploring the power of tables on the web
