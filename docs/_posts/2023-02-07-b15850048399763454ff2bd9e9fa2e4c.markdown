Summarization systems make numerous decisions about summary properties during inference, eg degree of copying, specificity and length of outputs, etc. However, these are implicitly encoded within model parameters and specific styles cannot be enforced. To address this, we introduce HydraSum, a new summarization architecture that extends the single decoder framework of current models to a mixture-of-experts version with multiple decoders. We show that HydraSum s multiple Cites: The Perils of Using Mechanical Turk to Evaluate Open-Ended Text
