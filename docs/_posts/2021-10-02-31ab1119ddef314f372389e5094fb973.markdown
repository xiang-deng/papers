Context: Stack Overflow is very helpful for software developers who are seeking answers to programming problems. Previous studies have shown that a growing number of questions are of low-quality and thus obtain less attention from potential answerers. Gao et al. proposed a LSTM-based model (ie, BiLSTM-CC) to automatically generate question titles from the code snippets to improve the question quality. However, only using the code snippets in question body cannot provide Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
