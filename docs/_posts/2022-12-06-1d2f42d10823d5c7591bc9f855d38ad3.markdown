Fault diagnosis of gearbox is essential for the safe operation of the modern industrial system. Recently, supervised deep learning based approaches have rapidly developed because they can achieve an automated fault-sensitive feature extraction process. However, most deep learning based methods work on the assumption that labeled data is sufficient, and the field data recorded with label information is difficult to obtain in practical industrial applications. Moreover, there is a huge amount of Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
