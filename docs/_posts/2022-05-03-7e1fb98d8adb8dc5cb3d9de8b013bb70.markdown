Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) operate in dynamic and uncertain environments where the use of deep neural networks (DNN) for perception can be advantageous. However, DNN integration in CPS is not straightforward. Perception outputs must be complemented with assurance metrics that represent if they can be trusted or not. Further, the inputs to DNNs are typically sequential capturing time-correlated data that can affect the accuracy of the predictions since machine learning models require Cites: Verified uncertainty calibration
