The Hopf oscillator is a nonlinear oscillator that exhibits limit cycle motion. This reservoir computer utilizes the vibratory nature of the oscillator, which makes it an ideal candidate for reconfigurable sound recognition tasks. In this paper, the capabilities of the Hopf reservoir computer performing sound recognition are systematically demonstrated. This work shows that the Hopf reservoir computer can offer superior sound recognition accuracy compared to legacy approaches (eg, a Mel …
