Nearest neighbor machine translation augments the Autoregressive Translation~(AT) with $ k $-nearest-neighbor retrieval, by comparing the similarity between the token-level context representations of the target tokens in the query and the datastore. However, the token-level representation may introduce noise when translating ambiguous words, or fail to provide accurate retrieval results when the representation generated by the model contains indistinguishable context …
