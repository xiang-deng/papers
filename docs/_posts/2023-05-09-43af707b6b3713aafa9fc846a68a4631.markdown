Learning on graphs has raised massive attention in the machine-learning community due to various real-world applications. Random walks on graphs, or say graph propagation, have been one of the most popular core ideas in many graph-learning methods. Examples range from classical methods such as PageRank and label propagation to graph convolution and message-passing mechanisms in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While there are plenty of graph learning problems such as …
