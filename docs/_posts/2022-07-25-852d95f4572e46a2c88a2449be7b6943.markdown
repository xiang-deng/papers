Currently the most common and effective procedure of early detection of breast cancer is through screening mammography. Mammography detects not only invasive cancers, but also in situ lesions including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which is the most common non-invasive breast cancer. The focus of this dissertation is to investigate machine learning and deep learning technologies to improve detection and diagnosis of breast cancer from mammography, focusing on calcifications that  Cites: Evaluation of combined artificial intelligence and radiologist
