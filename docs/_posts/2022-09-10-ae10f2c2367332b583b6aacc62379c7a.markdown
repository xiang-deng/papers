Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in location-based social networks, yet remains challenging due to a high degree of variation and personalization exhibited in user movements. In this work, we explore the latent hierarchical structure composed of multi-granularity short-term structural patterns in user check-in sequences. We propose a Spatio-Temporal context AggRegated Hierarchical Transformer (STAR-HiT) for next POI recommendation, which employs Cites: Blockwise Self-Attention for Long Document Understanding
