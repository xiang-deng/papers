Despite their ability to detect critical bugs in software, static analysis tools  high false positive rates are a key barrier to their adoption in real-world settings. To improve the usability of these tools, researchers have recently begun to apply machine learning techniques to classify and filter incorrect analysis reports. Although initial results have been promising, the long-term potential and best practices for this line of research are unclear due to the lack of detailed, large-scale empirical evaluation. To …
