In a multirobot system, a number of cyber-physical attacks (eg, communication hijack, observation perturbations) can challenge the robustness of agents. This robustness issue worsens in multiagent reinforcement learning because there exists the non- stationarity of the environment caused by simultaneously learning agents whose changing policies affect the transition and reward functions. In this paper, we propose a minimax MARL approach to infer the worst-case policy update of other Cites: Semidefinite relaxations for certifying robustness to adversarial
