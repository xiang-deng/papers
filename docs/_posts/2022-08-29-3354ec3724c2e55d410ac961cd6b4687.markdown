Face synthesis based on attribute words is a novel and challenging topic in computer vision, which has various application potentials in public security and multimedia. Existing attribute vector-to-face (V2F) synthesis methods mainly generate faces based on attribute label vectors that lack rich semantic feature information, which leads to low-quality generated face images. To address this challenge, we advocate attribute word-to-face (W2F) synthesis, using attribute-word sequences that contain Cites: LXMERT: Learning Cross-Modality Encoder Representations from
