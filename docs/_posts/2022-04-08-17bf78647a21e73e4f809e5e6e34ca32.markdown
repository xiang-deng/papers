High-resolution images are widely adopted for high-performance object detection in videos. However, processing high-resolution inputs comes with high computation costs, and naive down-sampling of the input to reduce the computation costs quickly degrades the detection performance. In this paper, we propose SALISA, a novel non- uniform SALiency-based Input SAmpling technique for video object detection that allows for heavy down-sampling of unimportant background regions while Cites: Globally-aware multiple instance classifier for breast cancer
