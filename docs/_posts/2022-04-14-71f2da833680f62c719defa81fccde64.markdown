Neural network is a popular and significant research direction in machine learning, which is widely used in classification. regression, pattern recognition and other fields. Based on the current direction of academic research, the application of neural network in image classification has great research value. However, due to a large number of such articles, involving too wide a range of aspects, it is difficult to grasp the main idea quickly when quoting. We have selected and sorted out some Cites: Deep learning-enabled medical computer vision
