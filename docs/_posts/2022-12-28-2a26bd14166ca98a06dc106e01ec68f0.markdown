Recent advances in graph-based learning approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in modelling users preferences and items characteristics for Recommender Systems (RSS). Most of the data in RSS can be organized into graphs where various objects (eg, users, items, and attributes) are explicitly or implicitly connected and influence each other via various relations. Such a graph-based organization brings benefits to exploiting potential properties in graph  Cites: Recommender systems with social regularization
