Event extraction (EE) occupies an important position in information extraction. Recently, deep neural network methods have been demonstrated to learn potential features well. However, existing networks for EE suffer from the following challenges:(1) Event argument extraction relies heavily on the classification of event triggers.(2) Previous works fail to exploit the predefined label representations for EE.(3) The interactive information between candidate arguments has not been fully  Cites: A language-independent neural network for event detection
