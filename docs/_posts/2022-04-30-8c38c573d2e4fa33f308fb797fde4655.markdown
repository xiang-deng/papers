Logical approaches to representing language have developed and evaluated computational models of quantifier words since the 19th century, but today s NLU models still struggle to capture their semantics. We rely on Generalized Quantifier Theory for language-independent representations of the semantics of quantifier words, to quantify their contribution to the errors of NLU models. We find that quantifiers are pervasive in NLU benchmarks, and their occurrence at test time is Cites: Dynabench: Rethinking benchmarking in NLP
