Normalisation is a preprocessing technique widely employed in Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions for industry to equalise the features  contribution. However, few researchers have analysed the normalisation effect and its implications on the ML algorithm performance, especially on Euclidean distance-based algorithms, such as the well-known K-Nearest Neighbours and K-means. In this sense, this paper formally analyses the effect of normalisation yielding results significantly far from the Cites: Automatic evaluation of information ordering: Kendall s tau
