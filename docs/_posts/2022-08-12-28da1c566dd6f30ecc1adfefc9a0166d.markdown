In order to dynamically manage and update networking policies in cloud data centers, Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) use, and therefore actively collect, networking state information-and in the process, incur additional control signaling and management overhead, especially in larger data centers. In the meantime, VNFs in production prefer distributed and straightforward heuristics over advanced learning algorithms to avoid intractable additional processing latency under high Cites: Mvfst-rl: An asynchronous rl framework for congestion control with
