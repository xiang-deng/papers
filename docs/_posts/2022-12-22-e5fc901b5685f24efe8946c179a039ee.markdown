As the scales of neural networks increase, techniques that enable them to run with low computational cost and energy efficiency are required. From such demands, various efficient neural network paradigms, such as spiking neural networks (SNNs) or binary neural networks (BNNs), have been proposed. However, they have sticky drawbacks, such as degraded inference accuracy and latency. To solve these problems, we propose a single-step spiking neural network (S 3 NN), an energy  Cites: Randaugment: Practical automated data augmentation with a
