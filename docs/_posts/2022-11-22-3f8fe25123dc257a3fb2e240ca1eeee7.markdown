A primary obstacle blocking the path towards trustworthy models for natural language understanding is the reliance on powerful, but opaque, neural models for natural language understanding tasks. These models are typically trained end-to-end in a supervised manner, and have achieved state-of-the-art performance on several natural language understanding benchmarks. This thesis addresses the challenge of shedding light on the mechanisms neural models use to perform tasks …
