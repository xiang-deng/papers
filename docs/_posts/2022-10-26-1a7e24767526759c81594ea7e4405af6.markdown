The design of highly accurate deep learning architectures is related to different parameters through different optimizations at different levels of the design. While the architectural design and the training procedure of the neural networks play significant role, the quantity and the quality of the available data remain also very important issues. This research aims to address the quality of the data issue: the data contain imprecise or noisy labels. Numerous approaches have been proposed in the …
