The characterization of 3D structures in porous media is crucial for predicting physical properties in many industries, such as CO2 capture and storage, hydrology, oil & gas. In contrast to the expensive and time-consuming acquisition of 3D images, 2D imaging can provide cheap and fast data. However, the reconstruction of a 3D image from a single 2D image is a complex non-deterministic inverse problem. Several statistical and deep learning-based algorithms have been introduced in the … Cites: ‪The curious case of neural text degeneration‬
