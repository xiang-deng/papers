Due to knowledge alienation, the application of AI techniques in tunnel construction has been greatly stented in recent years. In order to motivate the development of techniques in tunneling works, we propose an approach that combines automated machine learning, explainable AI, and building information modeling in this paper. Considering geotechnical uncertainties from soil properties and aleatoric uncertainties from the predicting model, this approach is used to evaluate the system …
