With the aging of reinforced concrete structures, textiles, which are fiber composite materials, have been gaining attention for structural strengthening and replacement of steel reinforcements. The application of textile-reinforced mortar (TRM) is one method of strengthening structures using textiles. Various factors affect the performance when structures are strengthened with TRM; it is affected by the physical properties of the material, such as tensile strength and elongation, and …
