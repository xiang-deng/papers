Recently, several dense retrieval (DR) models have demonstrated competitive performance to term-based retrieval that are ubiquitous in search systems. In contrast to term-based matching, DR projects queries and documents into a dense vector space and retrieves results via (approximate) nearest neighbor search. Deploying a new system, such as DR, inevitably involves tradeoffs in aspects of its performance. Established retrieval systems running at scale are usually well understood in terms of  Cites: NeurIPS 2020 EfficientQA competition: Systems, Analyses and
