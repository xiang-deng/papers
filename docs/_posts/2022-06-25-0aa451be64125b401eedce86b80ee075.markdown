GitHub and OpenAI recently launched Copilot, an “AI pair programmer” that utilizes the power of Natural Language Processing, Static Analysis, Code Synthesis, and Artificial Intelligence. Given a natural language description of the target functionality, Copilot can generate corresponding code in several programming languages. In this paper, we perform an empirical study to evaluate the correctness and understandability of Copilot s suggested code. We use 33 LeetCode questions to …
