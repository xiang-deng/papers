Sentence simplification tends to focus on the generic simplification of sentences by making them more readable and easier to understand. This paper provides a dataset aimed at training models that perform subject aware sentence simplifications rather than simplifying sentences as a whole. We also test models on that dataset which are inspired by model architecture used in abstractive summarization. We hand generated portions of the data and augment the dataset by further manipulating Cites: Sentence simplification with deep reinforcement learning
