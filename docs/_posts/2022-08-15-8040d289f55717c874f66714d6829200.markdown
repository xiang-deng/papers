Decision trees can be used to enhance the interpretability of neural networks. In this work, we compare the classification and interpretability performance of the normal decision tree and a type of soft decision tree when they are used to interpret the decision paths of CNN networks. With the help of feature visualization and human-labeled features, we demonstrate that the soft decision trees identify more consistent features while maintaining much higher classification performance than the normal Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
