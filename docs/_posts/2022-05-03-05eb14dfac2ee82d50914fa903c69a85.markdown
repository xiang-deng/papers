In this paper, we describe a phonotactic language recognition model that effectively manages long and short n-gram input sequences to learn contextual phonotactic- based vector embeddings. Our approach uses a transformer-based encoder that integrates a sliding window attention to attempt finding discriminative short and long cooccurrences of language dependent n-gram phonetic units. We then evaluate and compare the use of different phoneme recognizers (Brno and Allosaurus) and sub Cites: Universal phone recognition with a multilingual allophone system
