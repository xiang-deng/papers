Large pre-trained language models have recently enabled open-ended generation frameworks (eg, prompt-to-text NLG) to tackle a variety of tasks going beyond the traditional data-to-text generation. While this framework is more general, it is under-specified and often leads to a lack of controllability restricting their real-world usage. We propose a new grounded keys-to-text generation task: the task is to generate a factual description about an entity given a set of guiding keys, and grounding  Cites: Joint passage ranking for diverse multi-answer retrieval
