The accuracy of named entity recognition task will promote the research of multiple downstream tasks in natural language field. Due to a large number of nested semantics in text, named entities are recognized difficultly. Recognizing nested semantics becomes a difficulty in natural language processing. Previous studies have single scale of extracting feature and under-utilization of the boundary information. They ignore many details under different scales and then lead to the Cites: Neural segmental hypergraphs for overlapping mention recognition
