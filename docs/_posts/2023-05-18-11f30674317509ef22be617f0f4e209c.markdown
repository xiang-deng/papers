Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have accomplished impressive achievements in abstractive single-document summarization (SDS). However, such benefits may not be readily extended to muti-document summarization (MDS), where the interactions among documents are more complex. Previous works either design new architectures or new pre-training objectives for MDS, or apply PLMs to MDS without considering the complex document interactions. While the former does not make full …
