Learning big models and then transfer has become the de facto practice in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). However, such unified paradigm is uncommon for recommender systems (RS). A critical issue that hampers this is that standard recommendation models are built on unshareable identity data, where both users and their interacted items are represented by unique IDs. In this paper, we study a novel scenario where user s interaction feedback involves mixture-of  Cites: Making Pre-trained Language Models Better Few-shot Learners
