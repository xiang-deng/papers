We present prompt distribution learning for effectively adapting a pre-trained vision- language model to address downstream recognition tasks. Our method not only learns low-bias prompts from a few samples but also captures the distribution of diverse prompts to handle the varying visual representations. In this way, we provide high-quality task-related content for facilitating recognition. This prompt distribution learning is realized by an efficient approach that learns the output embeddings of Cites: Contrastive learning of medical visual representations from paired
