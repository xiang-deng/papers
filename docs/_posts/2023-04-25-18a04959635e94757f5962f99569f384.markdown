The activities of the rotary axes of a five-axis machine tool generate heat causing temperature changes within the machine that contribute to tool center point (TCP) deviations. Real time prediction of these thermally induced volumetric errors (TVEs) at different positions within the workspace may be used for their compensation. A Stacked Long Short Term Memories (SLSTMs) model is proposed to find the relationship between the TVE s for different axis command positions and power Cites: Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for
