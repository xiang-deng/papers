Machine Learning-as-a-Service systems (MLaaS) have been largely developed for cybersecurity-critical applications, such as detecting network intrusions and fake news campaigns. Despite effectiveness, their robustness against adversarial attacks is one of the key trust concerns for MLaaS deployment. We are thus motivated to assess the adversarial robustness of the Machine Learning models residing at the core of these securitycritical applications with categorical inputs.
