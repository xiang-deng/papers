Abstractive summarization is a classic task in Natural Language Generation (NLG), which aims to produce a concise summary of the original document. Recently, great efforts have been made on sequence-to-sequence neural networks to generate abstractive sum-maries with a high level of fluency. However, prior arts mainly focus on the optimization of token-level likelihood, while the rich semantic information in documents has been largely ignored. In this way, the summarization results could be Cites: Asking and Answering Questions to Evaluate the Factual
