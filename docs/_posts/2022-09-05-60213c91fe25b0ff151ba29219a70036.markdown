This paper investigates using multi-label deep learning approach to extending the understanding of cognitive presence in MOOC discussions. Previous studies demonstrate the challenges of subjectivity in manual categorisation methods. Training automatic single-label classifiers may preserve this subjectivity. Using a triangulation approach, we developed a multi-label, fine-tuning BERT classifier to analyse cognitive presence to enrich results with state-of-the-art, single-label  Cites: RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach
