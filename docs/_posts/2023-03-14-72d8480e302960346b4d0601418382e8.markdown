Recently, for the abstractive summarization task, most of proposed techniques have adopted the deep recurrent neural network (RNN)-based sequential auto-encoding architecture to effectively learn and generate meaningful summaries for different input documents. However, most of recent RNN-based models always suffer the challenges related to the involvement of much capturing high-frequency/reparative phrases in long documents during the training process which leads to the outcome of …
