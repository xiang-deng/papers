Entity alignment refers to matching entities with the same realistic meaning in different knowledge graphs. The structure of a knowledge graph provides the global signal for entity alignment. But in the real world, a knowledge graph provides insufficient structural information in general. Moreover, the problem of knowledge graph heterogeneity is common. The semantic and string information can alleviate the problems caused by the sparse and heterogeneous nature of knowledge graphs …
