Topic models aim to reveal the latent structure behind a corpus, typically conducted over a bag-of-words representation of documents. In the context of topic modeling, most vocabulary is either irrelevant for uncovering underlying topics or contains strong relationships with relevant concepts, impacting the interpretability of these topics. Furthermore, their limited expressiveness and dependency on language demand considerable computation resources. Hence, we propose a novel approach Cites: Language models as knowledge bases?
