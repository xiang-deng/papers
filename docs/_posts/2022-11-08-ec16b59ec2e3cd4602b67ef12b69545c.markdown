Abstract Evaluation of the local scour at a uniform bridge pier has become an important issue for hydraulic engineers. However, it is still difficult to accurately predict the local scour depth at the bridge pier using empirical formulae. Reasons underlying this could be the limitation of the statistical fitting technique and the complexity of flow and scouring mechanisms. In this study, a target-modified attention neural network called masked attention neural network (MATN) has been proposed  Cites: Mask-predict: Parallel decoding of conditional masked language
