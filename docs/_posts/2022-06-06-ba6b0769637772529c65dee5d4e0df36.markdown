Bundle recommendation aims to recommend a bundle of related items to users, which can satisfy the users  various needs with one-stop convenience. Recent methods usually take advantage of both user-bundle and user-item interactions information to obtain informative representations for users and bundles, corresponding to bundle view and item view, respectively. However, they either use a unified view without differentiation or loosely combine the predictions of two  Cites: SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings
