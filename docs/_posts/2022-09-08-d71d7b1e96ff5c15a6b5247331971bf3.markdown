Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) use spatiotemporal spike patterns to represent and transmit information, which are not only biologically realistic but also suitable for ultralow-power event-driven neuromorphic implementation. Just like other deep learning techniques, Deep Spiking Neural Networks (DeepSNNs) benefit from the deep architecture. However, the training of DeepSNNs is not straightforward because the wellstudied error back-propagation (BP) algorithm is not directly Cites: Transformer-xl: Attentive language models beyond a fixed-length
