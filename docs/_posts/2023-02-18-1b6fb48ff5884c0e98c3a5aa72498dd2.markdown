Learning effective and discriminative speaker embeddings is a crucial task in speaker verification. Usually, speaker embeddings are extracted from a speaker-classification DNN that averages the hidden vectors over all the spoken frames of a speaker; the hidden vectors produced from all the frames are assumed to be equally important. In our previous work, we relaxed this assumption and computed the speaker embedding as a weighted average of a speaker s frame-level hidden …
