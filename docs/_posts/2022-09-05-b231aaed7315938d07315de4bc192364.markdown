Graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted extensive interest in text classification tasks due to their expected superior performance in representation learning. However, most existing studies adopted the same semi-supervised learning setting as the vanilla Graph Convolution Network (GCN), which requires a large amount of labelled data during training and thus is less robust when dealing with large-scale graph data with fewer labels. Additionally, graph structure information is normally Cites: A framework for contrastive self-supervised learning and designing
