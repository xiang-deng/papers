In the context of multi-step reasoning, language models (LMs) probabilities are often miscalibrated--solutions with high probabilities are not always correct. Therefore, greedy decoding, which is the standard decoding method for reasoning tasks, often yields incorrect solutions. In addition, methods such as self-consistency and verifiers rely on sampling from the LM distribution and do not tackle the underlying issue. To address this, we introduce Guiding Multi-step ReAsoning with a CorrectnEss  Cites: Gedi: Generative discriminator guided sequence generation
