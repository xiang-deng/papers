Code search is to search reusable code snippets from source code corpus based on natural languages queries. Deep learning-based methods of code search have shown promising results. However, previous methods focus on retrieval accuracy but lacked attention to the efficiency of the retrieval process. We propose a novel method CoSHC to accelerate code search with deep hashing and code classification, aiming to perform an efficient code search without sacrificing too much accuracy.
