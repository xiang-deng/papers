Selenium (Se) solar cells were the world s first solid-state photovoltaics reported in 1883, opening the modern photovoltaics. However, its wide bandgap (~ 1.9 eV) limits sunlight harvesting. Here, we revisit the world s oldest but long-ignored photovoltaic material with the emergence of indoor photovoltaics (IPVs); the absorption spectrum of Se perfectly matches the emission spectra of commonly used indoor light sources in the 400 to 700 nm range. We find that the widely used Te adhesion layer also  Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
