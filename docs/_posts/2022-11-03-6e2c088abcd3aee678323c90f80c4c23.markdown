Card game AI has always been a hot topic in the research of artificial intelligence. In recent years, complex card games such as Mahjong, DouDizhu and Texas Hold em have been solved and the corresponding AI programs have reached the level of human experts. In this paper, we are devoted to developing an AI program for a more complex card game, GuanDan, whose rules are similar to DouDizhu but much more complicated. To be specific, the characteristics of large state and action space, long Cites: Opponent modeling in deep reinforcement learning
