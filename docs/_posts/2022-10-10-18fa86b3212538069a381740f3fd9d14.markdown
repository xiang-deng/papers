Natural language understanding tasks require a comprehensive understanding of natural language and further reasoning about it, on the basis of holistic information at different levels to gain comprehensive knowledge. In recent years, pre-trained language models (PrLMs) have shown impressive performance in natural language understanding. However, they rely mainly on extracting context-sensitive statistical patterns without explicitly modeling linguistic information, such as semantic Cites: Unifiedskg: Unifying and multi-tasking structured knowledge
