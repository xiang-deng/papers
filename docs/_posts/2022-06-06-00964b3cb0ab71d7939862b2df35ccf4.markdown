Network embedding is an important class of link prediction methods, which can use the distance between learned low-dimensional node representations to characterize the similarity between nodes. Traditional network embedding methods focus on single-layer networks, while in reality, a large part of complex networks are not isolated, but interdependent and interrelated, forming multiplex complex networks. Also, how to effectively exploit layer correlations in multiplex networks to learn more
