Widely-used term-weighting schemes and machine learning (ML) classifiers with default parameter settings were assessed for their performance when applied to environmental big data analysis. Five term-weighting schemes [term frequency (TF), TFinverse document frequency (TF-IDF), Best Match 25 (BM25), TFinverse gravity moment (TF-IGM), and TFIDFinverse class frequency (TF-IDF-ICF)] and five different ML classifiers [support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), logistic Cites: A text mining framework for advancing sustainability indicators
