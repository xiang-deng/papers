Robustness of neural network models is important in fault diagnosis (FD) because uncertainty in operating conditions varies the power spectral densities of vibration data; however, it is unknown to users due to the limited explainability of the models. This paper proposes an FD framework with a POwer-perturbation-based decision Boundary Analysis (POBA) to explain the decision boundaries of vibration classification models. In the POBA, perturbed data are obtained from training data by Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
