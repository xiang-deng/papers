Script event prediction (SEP), aiming at predicting next event from context event sequences (ie, scripts), has played an important role in many realworld applications such as government decisionmaking. While most of the existing research only depend on the toplevel event prediction, they ignore the influence of other bottom levels or other relationship modeling manners. In this paper, we focus on the problem of SEP via multilevel script learning where the goal of is to explore a Cites: Story comprehension for predicting what happens next
