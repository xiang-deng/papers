Natural language processing (NLP) presently has become a new paradigm and enables a variety of applications such as text classification, information retrieval, and natural language generation by leveraging deep learning techniques. However, recent studies have shown that the NLP models based on deep neural network are susceptible to maliciously designed adversarial examples. Therefore, the main challenges lie in improving the robustness and ensuring the security of the system. In Cites: White-to-Black: Efficient Distillation of Black-Box Adversarial Attacks
