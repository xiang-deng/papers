The target of a coreference resolution system is to cluster all mentions that refer to the same entity in a given context. All coreference resolution systems need to solve two subtasks; one task is to detect all of the potential mentions, and the other is to learn the linking of an antecedent for each possible mention. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning actor-critic-based neural coreference resolution system, which can achieve both mention detection and mention clustering by  Cites: Higher-order Coreference Resolution with Coarse-to-fine Inference
