Language has a strong influence on our perceptions of time and rewards. This raises the question of whether large language models, when asked in different languages, show different preferences for rewards over time and if their choices are similar to those of humans. In this study, we analyze the responses of GPT-3.5 (hereafter referred to as GPT) to prompts in multiple languages, exploring preferences between smaller, sooner rewards and larger, later rewards. Our results show that GPT  Cites: Fantastically ordered prompts and where to find them: Overcoming
