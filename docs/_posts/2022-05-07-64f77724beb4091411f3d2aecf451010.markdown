Program classification can be regarded as a high-level abstraction of code, laying a foundation for various tasks related to source code comprehension, and has a very wide range of applications in the field of software engineering, such as code clone detection, code smell classification, defects classification, etc. The cross-language program classification can realize code transfer in different programming languages, and can also promote cross-language code reuse, thereby helping developers to Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
