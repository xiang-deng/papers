Pancreatic cancers have one of the worst prognoses compared to other cancers, as they are diagnosed when cancer has progressed towards its latter stages. The current manual histological grading for diagnosing pancreatic adenocarcinomas is time-consuming and often results in misdiagnosis. In digital pathology, AI-based cancer grading must be extremely accurate in prediction and uncertainty quantification to improve reliability and explainability and are essential for gaining …
