The ability to model the information diffusion process and predict its size is crucial to understanding information propagation mechanism and is useful for many applications such as popularity prediction and fake news detection. Recent research works have attempted to address the problem of information cascade prediction using two basic paradigms:(1) sequential methods, eg, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and (2) graph learning techniques to retain the topological information and Cites: Neural diffusion model for microscopic cascade study
