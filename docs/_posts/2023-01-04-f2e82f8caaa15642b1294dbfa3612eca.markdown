Crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective platform to label a large volume of data in a cost-and time-efficient manner. Most previous works have focused on designing an efficient algorithm to recover only the ground-truth labels of the data. In this paper, we consider multi-choice crowdsourced labeling with the goal of recovering not only the ground truth but also the most confusing answer and the confusion probability. The most confusing answer provides useful information about the task by revealing Cites: Exact exponent in optimal rates for crowdsourcing
