In contemporary defense training and operations, users regularly encounter complicated and dynamic environments that generate large amounts of knowledge derived from locally acquired data. In order to facilitate collaborative decision making, users need to effectively share and distribute locally learned knowledge in a timely manner. This paper presents a semantic-based knowledge and information sharing system (S-KISS): a forum application for efficient peer-to-peer knowledge Cites: RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach
