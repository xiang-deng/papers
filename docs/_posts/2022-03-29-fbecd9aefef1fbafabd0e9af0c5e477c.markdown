Multi-task learning (MTL) improves learning efficiency compared to the single-task counterpart in that it performs multiple tasks at the same time. Due to the nature, it can achieve generalized performance as well as alleviate overfitting. However, it does not efficiently perform resource-aware inference from a single trained architecture. To address the issue, we aim to build a learning framework that minimizes the cost to infer tasks under different memory budgets. To this end, we Cites: Mobilebert: a compact task-agnostic bert for resource-limited devices
