We initiate the study of differentially private (DP) estimation with access to a small amount of public data. For private estimation of d-dimensional Gaussians, we assume that the public data comes from a Gaussian that may have vanishing similarity in total variation distance with the underlying Gaussian of the private data. We show that under the constraints of pure or concentrated DP, d+ 1 public data samples are sufficient to remove any dependence on the range parameters of the Cites: Large language models can be strong differentially private learners
