Recently, a kind of method based on single bipartite graph combined with single attention mechanism was proposed to solve the challenges of noisy labels and long-tailed distributions in distantly supervised relation extraction, which achieved competitive results. However, we argue that single bipartite graph will lose interactive information within each bipartite graph partition and single attention will cause attention bias. In order to improve the robustness of this method for noisy labels and Cites: A Frustratingly Easy Approach for Entity and Relation Extraction
