The recent work by Schuetz et al. 1  Combinatorial optimization with physics-inspired graph neural networks  introduces a physics-inspired unsupervised graph neural network (GNN) to solve combinatorial optimization problems on sparse graphs. To test the performances of these GNNs, the authors show numerical results for two fundamental problems: the maximum cut and the maximum independent set (MIS), concluding “that the graph neural network optimizer performs on par or outperforms …
