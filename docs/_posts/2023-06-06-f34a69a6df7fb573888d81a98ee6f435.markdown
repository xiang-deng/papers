We present a simple and unified approach for both continuous and discontinuous constituency parsing via autoregressive span selection. Constituency parsing aims to produce a set of non-crossing spans so that they can form a constituency parse tree. We sort gold spans in a predefined order and train a pointer network to autoregressively select spans by that order. To deal with a discontinuous span, we consecutively select its subspans from left to right, label all but the last subspans with Cites: Syntactically Supervised Transformers for Faster Neural Machine
