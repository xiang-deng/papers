This paper provides a survey of the state of the art of hybrid language models architectures and strategies for  complex  question-answering (QA, CQA, CPS). Very large language models are good at leveraging public data on standard problems but once you want to tackle more specific complex questions or problems you may need specific architecture, knowledge, skills, tasks, methods, sensitive data, performance, human approval and versatile feedback... This survey extends findings from the …
