Behavioural testing--verifying system capabilities by validating human-designed input-output pairs--is an alternative evaluation method of natural language processing systems proposed to address the shortcomings of the standard approach: computing metrics on held-out data. While behavioural tests capture human prior knowledge and insights, there has been little exploration on how to leverage them for model training and development. With this in mind, we explore behaviour-aware Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
