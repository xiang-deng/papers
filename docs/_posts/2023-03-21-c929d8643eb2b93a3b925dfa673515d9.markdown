Abstract The problem of Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) aims to answer a question based on a natural language context. Multi-hop MRC is a challenging task as it requires a deep comprehension and reasoning of disjoint pieces of information to find the answer. Recently, graph-based methods have become very popular in multi-hop MRC as they well model the problem and ease the reasoning task. However, most existing studies ignore some valuable information of the context. As a Cites: Learning to retrieve reasoning paths over wikipedia graph for
