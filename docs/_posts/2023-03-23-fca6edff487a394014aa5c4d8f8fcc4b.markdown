Reservoir identification is important for reservoir evaluation and petroleum development. Existing methods cannot automatically identify the categories of the reservoir that exhibit:(a) local features differences of well logging data;(b) limited with non-reservoir interference; and (c) insufficient real labels. Transfer learning-based methods utilize other blocks partially address the problem of small samples. However, they ignore the significant geological differences between blocks …
