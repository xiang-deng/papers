Modern-day computer networks are highly diverse and dynamic, calling for fair and adaptive network congestion control algorithms with the objective of achieving the best possible throughput, latency, and inter-flow fairness. Yet, prevailing congestion control algorithms, such as hand-tuned heuristics or those fueled by deep reinforcement learning agents, may struggle to perform well on multiple diverse networks. Besides, many algorithms are unable to adapt to time-varying real-world Cites: Mvfst-rl: An asynchronous rl framework for congestion control with
