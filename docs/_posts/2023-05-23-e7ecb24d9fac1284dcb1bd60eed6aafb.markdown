We argue that explainability is an appropriate and a challenging topic to tackle with GWAP methods. XAI is an appropriate fit for GWAP efforts because it requires human evaluation at scale for a task that can be broken down into pieces. Most GWAPs rely on collecting large amounts of data and then using validation to exclude low-quality data. However, common validation strategies are inappropriate for explainability tasks [17]. For example, in agreement designs, players contributions are evaluated Cites: Does the Whole Exceed its Parts? The Effect of AI Explanations on
