A significant question in deep learning is: what should that learning rate be? The answer to this question is often tedious and time consuming to obtain, and a great deal of arcane knowledge has accumulated in recent years over how to pick and modify learning rates to achieve optimal training performance. Moreover, the long hours spent carefully crafting the perfect learning rate can be more demanding than optimizing network architecture itself. Advancing automated machine learning, we …
