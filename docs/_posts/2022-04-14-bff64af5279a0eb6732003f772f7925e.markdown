Text classification is the most fundamental and essential task in natural language processing. The last decade has seen a surge of research in this area due to the unprecedented success of deep learning. Numerous methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics have been proposed in the literature, raising the need for a comprehensive and updated survey. This paper fills the gap by reviewing the state-of- the-art approaches from 1961 to 2021, focusing on models from traditional models to Cites: Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate
