The virtual-to-real paradigm, ie, training models on virtual data and then applying them to solve real-world problems, has attracted more and more attention from various domains by successfully alleviating the data shortage problem in machine learning. To summarize the advances in recent years, this survey comprehensively reviews the literature, from the viewport of parallel intelligence. First, an extended parallel learning framework is proposed to cover main domains including computer  Cites: An Empirical Survey of Data Augmentation for Limited Data
