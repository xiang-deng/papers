Vulnerability identification is crucial for cyber security in the software-related industry. Early identification methods require significant manual efforts in crafting features or annotating vulnerable code. Although the recent pre-trained models alleviate this issue, they overlook the multiple rich structural information contained in the code itself. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-View Pre-Trained Model (MV-PTM) that encodes both sequential and multi-type structural information of the source code and Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
