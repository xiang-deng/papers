Subgraph counting, as a fundamental problem in network analysis, is to count the number of subgraphs in a data graph that match a given query graph by either homomorphism or subgraph isomorphism. The importance of subgraph counting derives from the fact that it provides insights of a large graph, in particular a labeled graph, when a collection of query graphs with different sizes and labels are issued. The problem of counting is challenging. On the one hand, exact counting by  Cites: On the relationship between data efficiency and error for
