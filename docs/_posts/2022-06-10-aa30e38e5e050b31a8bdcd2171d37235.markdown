Automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks have become important tools in the data scientists  arsenal, as they dramatically reduce the manual work devoted to the construction of ML pipelines. Such frameworks intelligently search among millions of possible ML pipelines-typically containing feature engineering, model selection and hyper parameters tuning steps-and finally output an optimal pipeline in terms of predictive accuracy. However, when the dataset is large, each individual
