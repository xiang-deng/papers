Given a programming problem, pre-trained language models such as Codex have demonstrated the ability to generate multiple different code solutions via sampling. However, selecting a correct or best solution from those samples still remains a challenge. While an easy way to verify the correctness of a code solution is through executing test cases, producing high-quality test cases is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we explore the use of pre-trained language models to automatically Cites: Program synthesis with large language models
