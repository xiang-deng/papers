Presence of irrelevant sentences containing irrelevant quantities in Math Word Problems (MWPs) throws an immense challenge in formulating the final equation (s). Failure in identification of the relevant quantities with respect to the question asked in an MWP reduces the overall system performance. This paper demonstrates a novel deep learning-based approach using Siamese neural network to classify the relevant and irrelevant sentences towards identification of the relevant quantities in arithmetic Cites: MAWPS: A math word problem repository
