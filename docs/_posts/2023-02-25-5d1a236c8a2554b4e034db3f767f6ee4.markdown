Test case generation is an important activity, yet a time-consuming and laborious task. Recently, AthenaTest--a deep learning approach for generating unit test cases--is proposed. However, AthenaTest can generate less than one-fifth of the test cases correctly, due to a lack of assertion knowledge and test signature verification. In this paper, we propose A3Test, a DL-based test case generation approach that is augmented by assertion knowledge with a mechanism to verify naming consistency  Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
