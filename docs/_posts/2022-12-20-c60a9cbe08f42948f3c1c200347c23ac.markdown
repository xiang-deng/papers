Quantum many-body problems are some of the most challenging problems in science and are central to demystifying some exotic quantum phenomena, eg, high-temperature superconductors. The combination of neural networks (NN) for representing quantum states, coupled with the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) algorithm, has been shown to be a promising method for solving such problems. However, the run-time of this approach scales quadratically with the number of  Cites: Transformer quality in linear time
