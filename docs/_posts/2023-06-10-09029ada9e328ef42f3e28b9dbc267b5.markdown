In this paper, we present a simple but performant semi-supervised semantic segmentation approach, termed CorrMatch. Our goal is to mine more high-quality regions from the unlabeled images to leverage the unlabeled data more efficiently via consistency regularization. The key contributions of our CorrMatch are two novel and complementary strategies. First, we introduce an adaptive threshold updating strategy with a relaxed initialization to expand the high-quality regions. Furthermore  Cites: Rethinking pre-training and self-training
