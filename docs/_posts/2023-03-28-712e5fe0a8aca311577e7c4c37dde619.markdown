Abstract Propositional Projection Temporal Logic (PPTL) has been widely used in formal verification, and its expressiveness is suitable for the description of security requirements. However, the expression and application of temporal logic formulas rely on a strong mathematical background, which is difficult for non-domain experts, thus bridging the chasm between natural language descriptions and formal languages is urgently needed. This paper proposes an innovative architecture for …
