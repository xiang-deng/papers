Automated code summarization is the task of automatically generating natural language descriptions of source code, which is an important research topic in the software engineering field. Many methods in recent studies were based on deep learning techniques, which effectively improve the performance of code summarization. Most of the existing code summarization methods use different kinds of neural networks to learn source code information. Some methods use graph …
