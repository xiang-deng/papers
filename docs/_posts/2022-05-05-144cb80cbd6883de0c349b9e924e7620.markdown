Modern particle detectors are becoming larger, more granular, and complex. That led to a dramatic increase in data volumes coming from the experiment detectors that must be processed to reconstruct and filter interesting events. In this sense, Large Hadron Collider experiments offer a representative scenario. At the Large Hadron collider, proton-proton collisions occur every 25 ns and this extreme collision rate translates into hundreds of terabytes per second of data that the experiments, such Cites:   Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
