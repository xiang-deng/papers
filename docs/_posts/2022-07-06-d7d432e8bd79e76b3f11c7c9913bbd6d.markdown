Unlike herbaceous plants, woody plants undergo volumetric growth (aka secondary growth) through wood formation, during which the secondary xylem (ie, wood) differentiates from the vascular cambium. Wood is the most abundant biomass on Earth and, by absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide, functions as one of the largest carbon sinks. As a sustainable and eco-friendly energy source, lignocellulosic biomass can help address environmental pollution and the global climate crisis  Cites: BRL1 and BRL3 are novel brassinosteroid receptors that function
