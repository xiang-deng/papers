One of the significant challenges of Machine Translation (MT) is the scarcity of large amounts of data, mainly parallel sentence aligned corpora. If the evaluation is as rigorous as resource-rich languages, both Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) can produce good results with such large amounts of data. However, it is challenging to improve the quality of MT output for low resource languages, especially in NMT and SMT. In order to tackle the …
