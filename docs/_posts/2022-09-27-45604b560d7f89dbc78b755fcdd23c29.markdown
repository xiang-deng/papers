Most studies on learning from noisy labels rely on unrealistic models of iid label noise, such as class-conditional transition matrices. More recent work on instance-dependent noise models are more realistic; however, these models assume a single generative process for label noise across the entire dataset, which does not accurately capture the real-world labeling dynamics observed in modern dataset collection. We propose a new model of label noise, which we call labeler-dependent Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
