Many existing automated compliance checking (ACC) systems require the processes of extracting regulatory information from natural-language building-code requirements and transforming the extracted information into computer-processable semantic representations. These processes could, however, be jeopardized by the ambiguous nature of the natural language and the hierarchically complex structures of building-code requirements. To address this problem, this paper proposes the Cites: Get to the point: Summarization with pointer-generator networks
