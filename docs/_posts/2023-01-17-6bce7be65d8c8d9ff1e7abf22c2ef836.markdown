Hypergraph streams provide an efficient model to express and preserve complex connections in various applications. Triangles in a hypergraph can be formed by vertices and hyperedges. The specific counts of triangles are important to analyze various applications. Due to the huge costs of counting triangles based on the whole datasets, a sampling-and-estimating framework has low overhead while obtaining a relatively accurate result. However, existing sampling algorithms focus on pairwise Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
