Deep neural models revolutionized the research landscape in the Information Retrieval (IR) domain. Nowadays, they are employed at different stages in retrieval and ranking pipelines. For example, deep learning systems can automatically convert textual information into numerical features so that it can be later evaluated and compared by ranking models. Deep learning systems can also be effective in ranking items that have already been encoded into numerical features, ie comparing Cites: Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering
