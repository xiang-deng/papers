Source code summarization is the task of writing a short natural language summary for a section of source code. The most common targets for summarization are a program s subroutines. For example, a Java method with its accompanying JavaDoc string. Summaries help programmers more quickly understand code. The backbone of current code summarization techniques is the attentional encoder-decoder neural architecture, such as a seq2seq-like model. The research frontier is in improving  Cites: A C-LSTM Neural Network for Text Classification
