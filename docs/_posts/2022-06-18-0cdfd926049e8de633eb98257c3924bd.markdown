The goal of automatic text simplification is to reorganize complex text structures into simpler, more comprehendible texts while retaining their original meaning. The automatic text simplification model, coupled with the personalization element, makes it an indispensable tool for assisting students with learning disabilities who struggle to comprehend expository texts found in school textbooks. In recent years, neural networks have been widely embraced in simplified text generation, with most earlier
