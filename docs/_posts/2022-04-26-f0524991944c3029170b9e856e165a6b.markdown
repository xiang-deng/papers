Compared to traditional machine learning, deep learning can learn deeper abstract data representation and understand scattered data properties. It has gained considerable attention for its extraordinary performances. However, existing deep learning algorithms perform poorly on new tasks. Meta-learning, known as learning to learn, is one of the effective techniques to overcome this issue. Meta-learning s generalization ability to unknown tasks is improved by employing prior knowledge to Cites: Online structured meta-learning
