Abstract Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have achieved remarkable progress in both effectiveness and interpretability for complex question answering over knowledge base (KBQA). However, existing RL-based methods share a common limitation: the agent is usually misled by aimless exploration, as well as sparse and delayed rewards, leading to a large number of spurious relation paths. To address this issue, a new adaptive reinforcement learning (ARL) Cites: Multi-task learning for conversational question answering over a
