Interpretability and human oversight are fundamental pillars of deploying complex NLP models into real-world applications. However, applying explainability and human-in-the-loop methods requires technical proficiency. Despite existing toolkits for model understanding and analysis, options to integrate human feedback are still limited. We propose IFAN, a framework for real-time explanation-based interaction with NLP models. Through IFAN s interface, users can provide feedback to selected  Cites: Explainaboard: An explainable leaderboard for nlp
