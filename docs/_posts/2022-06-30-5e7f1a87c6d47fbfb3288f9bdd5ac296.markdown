Artificial intelligence has grown extensively, in both application and theory, in recent years. Much of the growth in application can be attributed to increased data generation and processing techniques, and much of the growth in theory can be attributed to advancements in deep learning techniques. As a result of these advancements, however, there is an increasing problem related to model interpretability and explainability of results; for many of the state-of-the-art techniques Cites: Adversarial examples for evaluating reading comprehension systems
