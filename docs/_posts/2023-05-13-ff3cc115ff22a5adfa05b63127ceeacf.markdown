This paper proposes a new depression detection system based on LLMs that is both interpretable and interactive. It not only provides a diagnosis, but also diagnostic evidence and personalized recommendations based on natural language dialogue with the user. We address challenges such as the processing of large amounts of text and integrate professional diagnostic criteria. Our system outperforms traditional methods across various settings and is demonstrated through case studies.
