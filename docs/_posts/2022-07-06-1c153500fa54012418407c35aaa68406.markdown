In this project we design and implement a microservice-based architecture for building temporal question answering systems on knowledge graph embedding models. We use a microservicebased architecture, as it provides us with the inherent scalability that comes with microservices, where load-balancing, combined with pod-management, means that a developer will not have to spend a lot of effort to upscale a system to encompass more simultaneous users. Furthermore, this type of  Cites: Complex embeddings for simple link prediction
