To judiciously use machine learning–particularly deep learning–requires identifying how to extract features from data and effectively leveraging those features to make predictions. This dissertation concerns deep learning methods for three applications: inverse modeling, legislator analysis, and computer vision for security. To address inverse problems, we present a new method, the Mixture Manifold Network, which uses multiple neural backward models in a forward-backward architecture. We …
