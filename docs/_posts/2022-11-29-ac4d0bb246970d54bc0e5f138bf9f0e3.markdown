The flow field under different flow conditions contains abundant structure information and is of great significance for aerodynamic analysis and aircraft design. Deep learning (DL) techniques have received great interest for flow field prediction due to their high capability of capturing structure characteristics in recent years. However, successful training of DL models usually requires a large amount of data, whose acquisition is prohibitively expensive and learning from insufficient flow field data still  Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
