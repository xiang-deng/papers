Semi-supervised semantic segmentation needs rich and robust supervision on unlabeled data. Consistency learning enforces the same pixel to have similar features in different augmented views, which is a robust signal but neglects relationships with other pixels. In comparison, contrastive learning considers rich pairwise relationships, but it can be a conundrum to assign binary positive-negative supervision signals for pixel pairs. In this paper, we take the best of both worlds and Cites: Simple copy-paste is a strong data augmentation method for
