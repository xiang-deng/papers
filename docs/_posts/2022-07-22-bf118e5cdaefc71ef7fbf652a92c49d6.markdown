Quantum algorithms based on variational approaches are one of the most promising methods to construct quantum solutions and have found a myriad of applications in the last few years. Despite the adaptability and simplicity, their scalability and the selection of suitable anstzs remain key challenges. In this work, we report an algorithmic framework based on nested Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) coupled with the combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) model for the automated design of  Cites: Theory-inspired path-regularized differential network architecture
