In clustering process, fuzzy partition performs better than hard partition when the boundaries between clusters are vague. Whereas, traditional fuzzy clustering algorithms produce less interpretable results, limiting their application in security, privacy, and ethics fields. To that end, this paper proposes an interpretable fuzzy clustering algorithmfuzzy decision tree-based clustering which combines the flexibility of fuzzy partition with the interpretability of the decision tree.
