With the development of deep learning technology, generative question answering models based on neural networks have gradually become a mainstream research direction in academia and industry. The current question answering models fail to make full use of the multi-level knowledge embedded in the learned corpus, and the interpretability and robustness of the models in the face of attack samples have certain shortcomings. From the perspective of information theory, this paper  Cites: Text generation from knowledge graphs with graph transformers
