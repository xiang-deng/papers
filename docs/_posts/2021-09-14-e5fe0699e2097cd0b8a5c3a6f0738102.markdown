Impoverished syntax and nondifferentiable vocabularies make natural language a poor medium for neural representation learning and applications. Learned, quasilinguistic neural representations (QNRs) can upgrade words to embeddings and syntax to graphs to provide a more expressive and computationally tractable medium. Graph-structured, embedding-based quasilinguistic representations can support formal and informal reasoning, human and inter-agent communication, and Cites: Entities as experts: Sparse memory access with entity supervision
