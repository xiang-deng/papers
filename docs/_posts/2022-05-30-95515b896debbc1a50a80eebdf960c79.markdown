Some questions have multiple answers that are not equally correct, ie answers are different under different conditions. Conditions are used to distinguish answers as well as to provide additional information to support them. In this paper, we study a more challenging task where answers are constrained by a list of conditions that logically interact, which requires performing logical reasoning over the conditions to determine the correctness of the answers. Even more challenging, we only provide  Cites: Explicit memory tracker with coarse-to-fine reasoning for
