Current computational models capturing words  meaning mostly rely on textual corpora. While these approaches have been successful over the last decades, their lack of grounding in the real world is still an ongoing problem. In this paper, we focus on visual grounding of word embeddings and target two important questions. First, how can language benefit from vision in the process of visual grounding? And second, is there a link between visual grounding and abstract concepts? We
