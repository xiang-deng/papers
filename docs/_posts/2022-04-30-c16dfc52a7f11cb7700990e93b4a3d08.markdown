Generative image synthesis with diffusion models has recently achieved excellent visual quality in several tasks such as text-based or class-conditional image synthesis. Much of this success is due to a dramatic increase in the computational capacity invested in training these models. This work presents an alternative approach: inspired by its successful application in natural language processing, we propose to complement the diffusion model with a retrieval-based approach and to Cites: Retrieval augmented language model pre-training
