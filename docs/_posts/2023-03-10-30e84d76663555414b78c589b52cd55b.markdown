For exploratory data analysis, it is often desirable to know what answers you are likely to get before actually obtaining those answers. This can potentially be achieved by designing systems to offer the estimates of a data operation result--say op (data)--earlier in the process based on partial data processing. Those estimates continuously refine as more data is processed and finally converge to the exact answer. Unfortunately, the existing techniques--called Online Aggregation (OLA) Cites: Database learning: Toward a database that becomes smarter
