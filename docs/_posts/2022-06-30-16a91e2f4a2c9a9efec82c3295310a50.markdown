Event extraction is a key task of information extraction. Existing methods are not effective due to two challenges of this task: 1) Most of previous methods only consider a single granularity information and they are often insufficient to distinguish ambiguity of triggers for some types of events. 2) The correlation among intra-sentence and inter-sentence event is non-trivial to model. Previous methods are weak in modeling interdependency among the correlated events and they have Cites: Adversarial Training for Weakly Supervised Event Detection
