Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most challenging breast cancer subtype. Molecular stratification and target therapy bring clinical benefit for TNBC patients, but it is difficult to implement comprehensive molecular testing in clinical practice. Here, using our multi-omics TNBC cohort (N= 425), a deep learning-based framework was devised and validated for comprehensive predictions of molecular features, subtypes and prognosis from pathological whole slide images (WSIs). The framework first …
