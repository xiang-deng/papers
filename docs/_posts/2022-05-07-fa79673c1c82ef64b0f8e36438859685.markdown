Building models that can be rapidly adapted to numerous tasks using only a handful of annotated examples is an open challenge for multimodal machine learning research. We introduce Flamingo, a family of Visual Language Models (VLM) with this ability. Flamingo models include key architectural innovations to:(i) bridge powerful pretrained vision-only and language-only models,(ii) handle sequences of arbitrarily interleaved visual and textual data, and (iii) seamlessly ingest images or Cites: Prefix-tuning: Optimizing continuous prompts for generation
