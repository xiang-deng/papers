Many well-performing embedding models for knowledge graphs employ a negative sampling framework to complete the representation learning in which the loss function is a critical component in distinguishing between positive and negative triplets. One of the most recently proposed loss functions is the double-limited scoring loss, which sets fixed upper and lower bounds respectively for positive and negative triplets. We find that, for all positive and negative triplets, fixed upper and
