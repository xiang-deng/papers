Digital twins can facilitate high-fidelity representations of container terminals by applying various technologies and methods to better measure, understand, and improve operations. In this paper, a decision support system (DSS) based on digital twin and big data technologies is designed to demonstrate how real-time monitoring and an integrated decision support can be established. The DSS provides optimal operation plans and the benchmark for vessel delay early warnings through different  Cites: Challenges and opportunities with Big Data 2011-1
