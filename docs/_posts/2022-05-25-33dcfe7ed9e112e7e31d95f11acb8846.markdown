The convolutional neural network is a deep learning architecture that has dominated most computer vision tasks for several years. But starting from 2020, Transformer architecture has turned to be a new challenger that has been expected to replace convolutional neural networks in the near future. Unlike researchers that prefer observing any new possibility in order to look for chances of improvement, achieving a new state-of-the-art model is not a goal for most practitioners.
