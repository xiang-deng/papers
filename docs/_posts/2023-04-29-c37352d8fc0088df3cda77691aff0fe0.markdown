Semantic answer type prediction (SMART) is known to be a useful step towards effective question answering (QA) systems. The SMART task involves predicting the top-$ k $ knowledge graph (KG) types for a given natural language question. This is challenging due to the large number of types in KGs. In this paper, we propose use of extreme multi-label classification using Transformer models (XBERT) by clustering KG types using structural and semantic features based on question text. We …
