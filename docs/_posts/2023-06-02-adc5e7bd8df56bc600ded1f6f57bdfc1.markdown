Many recent efforts aim to augment language models with relevant information retrieved from a database at test time. We avoid the need for prompt engineering by directly fine-tuning the model on data retrieved at test time using its standard training setup. For this purpose, we build a large-scale distributed nearest neighbor index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. Given a query to a language model, our system retrieves the neighbors of the query and fine-tunes the model on the text  Cites: Neuro-symbolic language modeling with automaton-augmented
