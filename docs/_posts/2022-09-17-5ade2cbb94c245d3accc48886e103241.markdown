Background In the context of largescale educational assessments, the effort required to code openended text responses is considerably more expensive and timeconsuming than the evaluation of multiplechoice responses because it requires trained personnel and long manual coding sessions. Aim Our semisupervised coding method eco (exploring coding assistant) dynamically supports human raters by automatically coding a subset of the responses. Method We map  Cites: SpanBERT: Improving Pre-training by Representing and Predicting
