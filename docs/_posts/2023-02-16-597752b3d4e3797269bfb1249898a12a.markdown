Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are able to solve a wide variety of tasks through transfer learning. Various explainability methods have been developed to investigate their decision making process. TracIn (Pruthi et al., 2020) is one such gradient-based method which explains model inferences based on the influence of training examples. In this paper, we explore the use of TracIn to improve model performance in the parameter-efficient tuning (PET) setting.
