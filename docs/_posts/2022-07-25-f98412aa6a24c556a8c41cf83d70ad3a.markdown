The language barrier is one of the practical challenges human being face during communication. To overcome this, researchers are focusing on using machines to translate a source language to a target language using the textual representations of the languages. Thus, machine translation (MT) could achieve a near human-level performance in terms of translation quality for several resource-rich languages. However, machine translation performance is still far from a production-level quality  Cites: Multilingual denoising pre-training for neural machine translation
