Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) models enable users to acquire entity-based answers from a Knowledge Graph by asking natural language questions (NLQs) without the need to learn a specialized graph query language or knowing the underlying schema of the knowledge graph. This work investigates hyperbolic graph representation learning methods to effectively and efficiently represent knowledge base items and natural questions. Our system, HyperKGQA …
