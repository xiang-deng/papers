Since more than a decade, many researchers have been focused on analogical proportions and their applications in different domains. Analogical proportions are known as statements of the form x is to y as z is to t that we denote x: y:: z: t. This relationship expresses that x differs from y as z differs from t, as well as y differs from x as t differs from z. Making the assumption that items x, y, z, and t form a valid analogical proportion, and given that item t is unknown, this is the basic root for Cites: Applying morphology generation models to machine translation
