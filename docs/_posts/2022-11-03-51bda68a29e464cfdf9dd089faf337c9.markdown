Network alignment aims to discover nodes in different networks belonging to the same identity. In recent years, the network alignment problem has aroused significant attentions in both industry and academia. With the rapid growth of information, the sizes of networks are usually very large and in most cases we only focus on the alignment of partial networks. However, under this circumstances, the collected network data may be highly biased, and the training and testing data are no Cites: Meta-learning for domain generalization in semantic parsing
