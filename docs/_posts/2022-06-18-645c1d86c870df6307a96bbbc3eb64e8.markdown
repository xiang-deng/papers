Under a newly introduced setting of multistream classification, two data streams are involved, which are referred to as source and target streams. The source stream continuously generates data instances from a certain domain with labels, while the target stream does the same task without labels from another domain. Existing approaches assume that domains for both data streams are identical, which is not quite true, since data streams from different sources may contain distinct features Cites: Tools for Automated Analysis of Cybercriminal Markets
