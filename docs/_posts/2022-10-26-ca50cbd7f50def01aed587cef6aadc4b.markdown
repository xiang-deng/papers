This paper proposes a novel prompt-based finetuning method (called DLM-SCS) for few-shot text classification by utilizing the discriminative language model ELECTRA that is pretrained to distinguish whether a token is original or generated. The underlying idea is that the prompt instantiated with the true label should have higher semantic consistency score than other prompts with false labels. Since a prompt usually consists of several components (or parts), its semantic consistency can be …
