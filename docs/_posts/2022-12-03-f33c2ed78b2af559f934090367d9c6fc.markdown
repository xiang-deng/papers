Arndt and Hirshman (1998) used MINERVA 2 to simulate true and false recognition in DRM-style lists and found that the model was able to capture many features of the empirical data. Here, we first replicate their simulations, but using empirically structured vectors derived from Latent Semantic Analysis rather than the randomly generated vectors characteristic of MINERVA 2. We report that the model still captures the DRM effect with fewer free parameters. We then extend our analyses to  Cites: Composition in distributional models of semantics
