Full-field discrete measurements of the continuous spatiotemporal response of physical processes often generate large datasets. Such continuous spatiotemporal dynamic models are represented by partial differential equations (PDEs). In the past, attempts have been made to identify the PDE models from the measured response by inferring its parameters via regression or deep learning-based techniques. But the previously presented regression-based methods fail to estimate the parameters of …
