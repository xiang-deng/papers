ChatGPT, as a recently launched large language model (LLM), has shown superior performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, two major limitations hinder its potential applications:(1) the inflexibility of finetuning on downstream tasks and (2) the lack of interpretability in the decision-making process. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel framework that leverages the power of ChatGPT for specific tasks, such as text classification, while improving its  Cites: Recent advances in natural language processing via large pre
