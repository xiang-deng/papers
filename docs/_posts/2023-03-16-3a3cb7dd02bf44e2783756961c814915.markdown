Machine learning (ML) models in production pipelines are frequently retrained on the latest partitions of large, continually-growing datasets. Due to engineering bugs, partitions in such datasets almost always have some corrupted features; thus, it s critical to detect data issues and block retraining before downstream ML model accuracy decreases. However, it s difficult to identify when a partition is corrupted enough to block retraining. Blocking too often yields stale model snapshots in Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
