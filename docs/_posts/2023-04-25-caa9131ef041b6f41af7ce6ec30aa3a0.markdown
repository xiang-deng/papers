Explainability (XAI) has matured in recent years to provide more human-centered explanations of AI-based decision systems. While static explanations remain predominant, interactive XAI has gathered momentum to support the human cognitive process of explaining. However, the evidence regarding the benefits of interactive explanations is unclear. In this paper, we map existing findings by conducting a detailed scoping review of 48 empirical studies in which interactive Cites: Concept bottleneck models
