Crowdsourcing has attracted considerable attention in recent years. A large amount of labeled data can be obtained efficiently and cheaply from the crowdsourcing platform. Therefore, providing a complete, feasible and efficient paradigm for marking unlabeled data in crowdsourcing is in demand. Since the quality of crowd workers directly influences the quality of the labeled data, an optimization model subjecting to quality constraints is built in this paper, with the aim to minimize cost function which is  Cites: Statistical decision making for optimal budget allocation in crowd
