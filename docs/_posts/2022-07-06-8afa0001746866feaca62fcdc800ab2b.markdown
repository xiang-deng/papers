The major success of any machine learning algorithm heavily relies on an efficient representation learning of the data. Having inefficient representation learning of the data leads to loss of important information that can lead to poor performance of the downstream tasks. Graph representation learning is getting more popular due to the introduction of structural information with its own feature to get effective representation learning on graph data. In this work, we developed an efficient graph
