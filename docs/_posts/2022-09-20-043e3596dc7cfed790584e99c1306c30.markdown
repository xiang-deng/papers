Groundwater optimization models coupling Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII) with surrogate models have shown great success in recent years. However, most previous models adopted global optimization over time steps while ignoring the time-varying properties of optimization objectives, which may lead to an unrealistic strategy for specific months. Moreover, employing global optimization for time-varying optimization may result in computation inefficient. To Cites: Adaptive Graph Encoder for Attributed Graph Embedding
