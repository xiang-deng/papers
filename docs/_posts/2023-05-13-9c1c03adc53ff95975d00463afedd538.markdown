Assembly instructions are critical for prompt fulfilment of assembly tasks. However, the design of such instructions is time-consuming and requires experience. Retrieve and reuse of previous cases shortens the design time and reduces design mistakes, whereas the traditional retrieval method encounters a bottleneck during encoding because the technical instructions include both structured and unstructured data. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical retrieval approach for automatic generation of …
