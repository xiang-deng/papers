An intelligent air quality monitoring system (IAQMS) is one of the key aspects of any smart city. The success of these monitoring systems largely depends on the quality of data. Missing air quality data is one of the crucial issues in any IAQMS, especially in small cities where sufficient historical air quality data is not available. In this study, a fuzzy transfer learning-based imputation (FTLI) method is proposed for the smart imputation of missing air quality data. The central concept of this proposed method is …
