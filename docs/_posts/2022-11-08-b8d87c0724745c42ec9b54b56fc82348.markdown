Adversarial attacks can mislead a Deep Learning (DL) algorithm into generating erroneous predictions via feeding maliciously-disturbed inputs called adversarial examples. DL-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms are severely threatened by adversarial attacks. In real-world, black-box adversarial attacks, the adversary needs to submit many highly-similar queries before drafting an adversarial example. Due to this long process, in-progress attack detection can play a significant …
