SimilaritySearch. jl that provides algorithms to efficiently retrieve k nearest neighbors from a metric dataset and other related problems with no knowledge of the underlying algorithms, since our main structure, the SearchGraph, has autotuning capabilities. The package is designed to work in main memory and takes advantage of multithreading systems in most of its primary operations.
