The advent of deep learning has led to a significant gain in machine translation. However, most of the studies required a large parallel dataset which is scarce and expensive to construct and even unavailable for some languages. This paper presents a simple yet effective method to tackle this problem for low-resource languages by augmenting high-quality sentence pairs and training NMT models in a semi-supervised manner. Specifically, our approach combines the cross-entropy loss …
