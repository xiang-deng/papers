In the field of NLP, sentence representation model is a popular task. The emergence of pre-trained representation model based on transformer structure yields significant results for downstream tasks. Besides, since the introduction of contrastive learning based on the pre-train representation model two years ago, there has been great interest in its notable benefits. For the sake of achieving better training results for sentence vector representation, we propose to use a training framework of …
