Many techniques have contributed to the advancement of auto-mated program repair, such as: generate and validate approaches, constraint-based solvers and even neural machine translation. Si-multaneously, artificial intelligence has allowed the creation of general-purpose pre-trained models that support several down-stream tasks. In this paper, we describe a technique that takes advantage of a generative model-CodeGPT-to automatically repair buggy programs by making use …
