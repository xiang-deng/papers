Abstract Knowledge graphs (KGs) are regarded as important resources for a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) and auxiliary decision tasks but suffer from incompleteness. To address this challenge, a number of knowledge graph representation (KGR) and knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods have been developed using graph embeddings manners. Most existing methods focus on the structured information of native triples in encyclopaedia KG and maximize the  Cites: Complex embeddings for simple link prediction
