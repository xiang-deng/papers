Image-based NLG systems have progressed to the point where they can begin to address this persistent societal problem, but these systems will not be fully successful unless we evaluate them on metrics that guide their development correctly. Here, we argue against current referenceless metrics--those that don t rely on human-generated ground-truth … Cites: ‪Bidimensional Leaderboards: Generate and Evaluate Language …‬
