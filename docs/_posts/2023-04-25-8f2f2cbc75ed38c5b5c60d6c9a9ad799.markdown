In multi-label classification, an instance may have multiple labels, and in few-shot scenario, the performance of model is more vulnerable to the complex semantic features in the instance. However, current prototype network only takes the mean value of instances in support set as label prototype. Therefore, there is noise caused by features of other labels in the calculated prototype, weakening the differences among prototypes, and affecting the prediction effect. To solve the above problem, a …
