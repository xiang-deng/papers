This study used explainable machine learning (XML), a new branch of Machine Learning (ML), to elucidate how ML models make predictions. Three tree-based regression models, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB), were used to predict the normalized mean (C p, mean), fluctuating (C p, rms), minimum (C p, min), and maximum (C p, max) external wind pressure coefficients of a low-rise building with fixed dimensions in urban-like settings for Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
