Sentence semantic equivalence identification (SSEI) targets to measure the semantic equivalence between two sentences. To supplement limited supervision, existing methods extensively employ contrastive learning to obtain sentence semantics. Albeit considerable progress, traditional sentence-wise contrastive learning cannot grasp the diverse semantics in the polysemic sentence. To alleviate this multi-vocal issue, a Pairwise Contrastive learning method (named PairContrast) for SSEI is Cites: Structured alignment networks for matching sentences
