Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a promising technology to bridge the communication gap between the deaf and the hearing people. Recently, researchers have adopted Neural Machine Translation (NMT) methods, which usually require large-scale corpus for training, to achieve SLT. However, the publicly available SLT corpus is very limited, which causes the collapse of the token representations and the inaccuracy of the generated tokens. To alleviate this issue, we propose Con-SLT  Cites: SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings
