Question classification (QC) involves classifying given question based on the expected answer type and is an important task in the Question Answering (QA) system. Existing approaches for question classification use full training dataset to fine-tune the models. It is expensive and requires more time to develop labelled datasets in huge size. Hence, there is a need to develop approaches that can achieve comparable or state of the art performance using limited training instances. In this  Cites: Learning question classifiers
