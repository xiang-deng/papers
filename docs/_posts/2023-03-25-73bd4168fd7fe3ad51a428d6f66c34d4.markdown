Label noise poses a serious threat to deep neural networks (DNNs). Employing robust loss function which reconciles fitting ability with robustness is a simple but effective strategy to handle this problem. However, the widely-used static trade-off between these two factors contradicts the dynamic nature of DNNs learning with label noise, leading to inferior performance. Therefore, we propose a dynamics-aware loss (DAL) to solve this problem. Considering that DNNs tend to first learn Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
