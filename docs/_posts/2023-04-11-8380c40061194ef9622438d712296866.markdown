Methods: De-identified crisis counseling data from a regional text-based crisis encounter and mobile tipline application were used to evaluate two modeling approaches in classifying client suicide risk levels.

While 75% of the neural model s false negative encounters had some discussion of  Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
