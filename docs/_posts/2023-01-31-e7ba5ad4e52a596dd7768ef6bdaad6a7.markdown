In recent years, many cases of deep neural networks failing dramatically when faced with adversarial or real-world examples have been reported. Such failures, which are quite hard to detect, are often related to a generalization problem known as shortcut learning. Yet, with state-of-the-art transformer models now being ubiquitous in financial text mining, one cannot help but wonder how reliable the results conveyed in the ever-growing literature genuinely are. Against this background, we expose, in …
