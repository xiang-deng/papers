Abductive reasoning seeks the likeliest possible explanation for partial observations. Although abduction is frequently employed in human daily reasoning, it is rarely explored in computer vision literature.

Given an incomplete set of visual events, AI systems are required to not only describe what is observed, but Cites: The Abduction of Sherlock Holmes: A Dataset for Visual Abductive
