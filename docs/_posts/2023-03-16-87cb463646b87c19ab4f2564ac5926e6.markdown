Abstract Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning is a powerful and practical approach for learning sequential decision-making policies. Compared to Reinforcement Learning, Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning has the ability to lean sequential decision-making policies when the reward function is unknown. Despite the significant empirical progresses, Instability of training and a great quantity of interactions are the two main problems of generative adversarial imitation …
