The evolving membrane technology integrated with machine learning (ML) algorithms can significantly advance the novel membrane material design and fabrication. Although several studies have reported ML-based assistance in membrane development, none of them have offered a complete analysis of existing ML-assisted membrane fabrication methods from material design perspective. A two-way information gateway is therefore necessary to achieve the desired objective Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
