A machine learning approach have been applied for reservoir characterization in this paper. The method consists of first simulating a set of realistic pseudowells based on the combination of statistical simulations and the application of theoretical rock-physics models. Then we perform AVO modelling to generate synthetic seismic gather. Finally, the pseudologs and synthetic data are then used to train a CNN. The trained CNN operators are then applied to the real seismic gather volume to obtain  Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
