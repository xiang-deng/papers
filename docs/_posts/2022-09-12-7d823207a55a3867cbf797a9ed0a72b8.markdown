Multistage compressors are widely used in essential equipment such as aero-engines, gas turbines, and industrial compressors. However, there are hundreds of geometric deviations with uncertain characteristics in the manufacture and maintenance of multistage compressors, resulting in severe performance dispersion. If the geometric deviation is strictly controlled, the performance dispersion can be effectively controlled, but the manufacturing and maintenance costs are high; Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
