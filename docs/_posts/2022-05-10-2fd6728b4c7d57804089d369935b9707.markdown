Abstract Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used to locate abnormal video frames in surveillance videos due to its ability to work with weakly-labeled data. On the other hand, graph-based semi-supervised approaches are employed to handle label sparsity-related issues such as Low Degree-of-Supervision (LDoS) and High Class-Imbalance (HCI). However, the application of the MIL paradigm in anomaly classification of surveillance videos faces significant challenges such as (i) LDoS,(ii) Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
