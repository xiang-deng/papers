Data augmentation is a critical contributing factor to the success of deep learning but heavily relies on prior domain knowledge which is not always available. Recent works on automatic data augmentation learn a policy to form a sequence of augmentation operations, which are still pre-defined and restricted to limited options. In this paper, we show that a prior-free autonomous data augmentation s objective can be derived from a representation learning principle that aims to preserve the Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
