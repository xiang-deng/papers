The proposed system is based on a diagnosis of COVID from x-ray images. In the respiratory system, 17 different viral infections are possible. Accurately discriminating COVID from other viral infections is necessary today as it spreads rapidly. The proposed system differentiates COVID infection accurately from other viral infections. The convolutional neural network (CNN) provides superior performance for disease diagnosis based on images in the deep learning era. In this chapter, to solve this Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
