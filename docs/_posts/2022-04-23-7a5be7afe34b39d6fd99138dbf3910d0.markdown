The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgency for developing more efficient molecular discovery pathways. As exhaustive exploration of the vast chemical space is infeasible, discovering novel inhibitor molecules for emerging drug-target proteins is challenging, particularly for targets with unknown structure or ligands. We demonstrate the broad utility of a single deep generative framework toward discovering novel drug-like inhibitor molecules against two distinct SARS-CoV-2 Cites: On the opportunities and risks of foundation models
