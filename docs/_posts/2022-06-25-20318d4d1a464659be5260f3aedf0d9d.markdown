Deep neural network models have been very successfully applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Image based tasks. Their application to network analysis and management tasks is just recently being pursued. Our interest is in producing deep models that can be effectively generalized to perform well on multiple network tasks in different environments. A major challenge is that traditional deep models often rely on categorical features, but cannot handle unseen …
