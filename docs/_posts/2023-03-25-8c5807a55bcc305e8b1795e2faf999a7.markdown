Big data analytics frameworks like Spark [Zaharia et al. 2010] and Flink [Carbone et al. 2015] have become increasingly popular for expressing queries over large amounts of data. These frameworks provide functional-style programming interfaces incorporating both higher-order APIs (eg, map and filter) as well as first-order user-defined functions (UDFs). This style of programming is appealing because the higher-order components enable concise expression of computations over large amounts of  Cites: Foofah: Transforming data by example
