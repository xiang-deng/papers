Contextual linear bandits is a rich and theoretically important model that has many practical applications. Recently, this setup gained a lot of interest in applications over wireless where communication constraints can be a performance bottleneck, especially when the contexts come from a large $ d $-dimensional space. In this paper, we consider a distributed memoryless contextual linear bandit learning problem, where the agents who observe the contexts and take actions are …
