Machine learning models have been widely adopted in several fields. However, most recent studies have shown several vulnerabilities from attacks with a potential to jeopardize the integrity of the model, presenting a new window of research opportunity in terms of cyber-security. This survey is conducted with a main intention of highlighting the most relevant information related to security vulnerabilities in the context of machine learning (ML) classifiers; more specifically, directed towards Cites: Stronger data poisoning attacks break data sanitization defenses
