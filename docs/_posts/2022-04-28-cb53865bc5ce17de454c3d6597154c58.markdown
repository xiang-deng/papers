As complex, black box models have increasingly come to predominate the algorithms used in state-of-the-art machine learning pipelines, the need to explain and understand the predictions made by these algorithms has grown correspondingly. Feature attribution methods are one popular approach to explain these black box models, but are limited in their expressive capacity. We therefore propose three approaches to go beyond the shortcomings of existing feature Cites: Is Attention Interpretable?
