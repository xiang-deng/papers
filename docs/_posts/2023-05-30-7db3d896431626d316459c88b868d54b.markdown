Inductive link prediction over knowledge graphs (KGs) aims to perform inference over a new graph with unseen entities. In contrast to transductive link prediction, which learns a fixed set of known entities and cannot handle unseen entities, inductive link prediction is closer to real-world scenarios because of the evolving nature of KGs. The recently proposed methods utilize the enclosing subgraph of candidate triples to obtain inductive ability. However, these methods explicitly  Cites: QA-GNN: Reasoning with language models and knowledge
