We present a criterion for two structures of probabilistic logic programs, ie programs with unspecified probabilities, to induce different sets of distributions. To this end we associate to each program structure a Datalog program, which we call the Pearl identifier. We then obtain that faithfully indistinguishable program structures yield equivalent Pearl identifiers. Moreover, we argue that the notion of faithful indistinguishability is sufficiently close to the notion of two program structures Cites: Static analysis in datalog extensions
