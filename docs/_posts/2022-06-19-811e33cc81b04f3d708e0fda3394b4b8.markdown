In this work, organic concerted companion (CC) dyes CCOD1 and CCOD2 have been constructed by covalently linking two organic dye units with complementary absorption spectra. Both CC dyes exhibit intense absorption from 300 to 650 nm with the band edges extended to 700 nm. These CC dyes have been used to fabricate dyesensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and the photovoltaic performance has been investigated using different light sources. CCOD2 possesses bulkier outer shelter Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
