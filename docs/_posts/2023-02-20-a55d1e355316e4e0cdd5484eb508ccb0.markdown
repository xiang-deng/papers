Identity plays an important role in responsible artificial i ntelligence (AI): ita cts asau nique m arker f or deep learning (DL) models and can be used to trace those accountable for irresponsible use of models. Consequently, effective DL identity audit is fundamental for building responsible AI. Besides models, training datasets determine what features a model can learn, and thus should be paid equal attention in identity audit. In this work, we propose the first practical scheme, named RAI2, for  Cites: Well-read students learn better: The impact of student initialization
