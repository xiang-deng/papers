In real-world applications, we often encounter multi-view learning tasks where we need to learn from multiple sources of data or use multiple sources of data to make decisions. Multi-view representation learning, which can learn a unified representation from multiple data sources, is a key pre-task of multi-view learning and plays a significant role in real-world applications. Accordingly, how to improve the performance of multi-view representation learning is an important issue. In this Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
