Deep learning has seen a meteoric rise in the machine learning community and has vastly changed the landscape of many fields like computer vision and natural language processing. Yet, for all of its successful applications, connecting deep learning theory to practice remains a challenge in the classroom, with students typically only seeing parts of the data-collection, training, and deployment process at a time. To address these difficulties, this work presents Pacman Trainer, a web Cites: Google s neural machine translation system: Bridging the gap
