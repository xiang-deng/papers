This paper investigates unsupervised approaches to overcome quintessential challenges in designing task-oriented dialog schema: assigning intent labels to each dialog turn (intent clustering) and generating a set of intents based on the intent clustering methods (intent induction). We postulate there are two salient factors for automatic induction of intents:(1) clustering algorithm for intent labeling and (2) user utterance embedding space. We compare existing off-the-shelf clustering models …
