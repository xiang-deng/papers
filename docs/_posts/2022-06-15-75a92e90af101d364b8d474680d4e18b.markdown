Abstract In this study, Global Ionosphere Maps (GIMs) were used to detect all Total Electron Content (TEC) precursors prior to the Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake at 06: 28: 01 (UTC) on 12 May 2008. The GIMs were converted into GIM-gis between 00.00 (UTC) on 01 December 2004 and 31 March 2005 and were used to build the Spectral-Based Graph Neural Network (SB-GNN) and Adaptive Butterworth Spectral-Based Graph Neural Network (ABSB-GNN) models. A blurred TEC precursor was
