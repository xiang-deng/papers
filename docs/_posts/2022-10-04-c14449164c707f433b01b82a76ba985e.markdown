The research on knowledge graph completion based on representation learning is increasingly dependent on the node structural feature in the graph. However, a large number of nodes have few immediate neighbors, resulting in the node features unable to be fully expressed. Hence, multi-hop structure features are crucial to the representation learning of nodes. GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) is a graph embedding model that can introduce the multi-hop structure. However, the multi-hop …
