Pilot factor is worth considering when analyzing the causes of civil aviation accidents. This study introduces a data-driven Bayesian network (BN) approach to investigating the joint causal effects of pilot and other factors on civil aviation safety. A total number of 163 individual pilot-related accidents in the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) aviation accident database from 2008 to 2020 are analyzed, focusing on eliciting the causal effects of various potential risk factors, including pilot  Cites: Initialization and restart in stochastic local search: Computing a
