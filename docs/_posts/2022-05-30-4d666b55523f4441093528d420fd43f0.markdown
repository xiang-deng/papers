Many recent works indicate that the deep neural networks tend to take dataset biases as shortcuts to make decision, rather than understand the tasks, which results in failures on the real-world applications. In this work, we focus on the spurious correlation between feature and label, which derive from the biased data distribution in the training data, and analyze it concretely. In particular, we define the word highly co-occurring with a specific label as biased word, and the example containing biased Cites: Avoiding the hypothesis-only bias in natural language inference
