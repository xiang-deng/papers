Competitive programming remains a very popular activity that combines both software engineering and education. In order to prepare and to practice, contestants use extensive archives of problems from past contents available on various competitive programming platforms. One way to make this process more effective is to provide an automatic tag system for the tasks. Prior works do that by either using the tasks  problem statements or the code of their solutions. In this study, we …
