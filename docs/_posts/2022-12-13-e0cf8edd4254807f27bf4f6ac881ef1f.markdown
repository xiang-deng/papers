Existing studies strive for building sophisticated deep neural networks to identify academic value based on comprehensive data, eg, academic graphs and full papers. However, these data are not always easy to access. And the content of the paper rather than other features outside the paper should matter in a fair assessment. Furthermore, while BERT models can maintain  Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
