Abstract Natural Language Processing (NLP) has known important interest and growth in recent years as may witness the increasing number of publications in different NLP tasks over the world. The primary focus of recent research has been to develop algorithms that process natural language in quantum computers, hence the emergence of new sub-domain called QNLP were proposed. Hence the objective of this paper is to provide to NLP researchers a new vision and way to deal with the Cites: How can we know what language models know?
