Despite their growing popularity, data-driven models of real-world dynamical systems require lots of data. However, due to sensing limitations as well as privacy concerns, this data is not always available, especially in domains such as energy. Pre-trained models using data gathered in similar contexts have shown enormous potential in addressing these concerns: they can improve predictive accuracy at a much lower observational data expense. Theoretically, due to the risk posed by Cites: Pre-Trained Models: Past, Present and Future
