Reconstruction of the frontal face from the profile is of great significance for face recognition in complex scenes. The existing mainstream methods of face reconstruction, such as FF-GAN, CAPG-GAN, TP-GAN, etc., have made good progresses on improving the generator network, but fewer considerations on the identification of face details and the extraction of spatial context features. To address the problem, we propose the frontal face reconstruction based on the detail Cites: Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate
