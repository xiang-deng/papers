While annotating decent amounts of data to satisfy sophisticated learning models can be cost-prohibitive for many real-world applications. Active learning (AL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) are two effective, but often isolated, means to alleviate the data-hungry problem. Some recent studies explored the potential of combining AL and SSL to better probe the unlabeled data. However, almost all these contemporary SSL-AL works use a simple combination strategy, ignoring SSL and  Cites: Importance of Semantic Representation: Dataless Classification.
