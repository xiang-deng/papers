Deep convolutional neural networks are shown to be overkill with high parametric and computational redundancy in many application scenarios, and an increasing number of works have explored model pruning to obtain lightweight and efficient networks. However, most existing pruning approaches are driven by empirical heuristics and rarely consider the joint impact of channels, leading to unguaranteed and suboptimal performance. In this article, we propose a novel channel pruning  Cites: Good subnetworks provably exist: Pruning via greedy forward
