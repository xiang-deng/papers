Over the last few years, various multi-view graph clustering methods have shown promising performances. However, we argue that these methods can have limitations. In particular, they are often unnecessarily complex, leading to scalability problems that make them prohibitive for most real-world graph applications. Furthermore, many of them can handle only specific types of multi-view graphs. Another limitation is that the process of learning graph representations is separated …
