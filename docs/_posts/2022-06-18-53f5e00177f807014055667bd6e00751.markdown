Most publicly accessible single-cell Hi-C data are sparse and cannot reach a higher resolution. Therefore, learning latent representations (bin-specific embeddings) of sparse single-cell Hi-C matrices would provide us with a novel way of mining valuable information hidden in the limited number of single-cell Hi-C contacts. We present scHiCEmbed, an unsupervised computational method for learning bin-specific embeddings of single-cell Hi-C data, and the computational system is
