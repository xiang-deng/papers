Abstract Source Code Generation (SCG) is a prevalent research field in the automation software engineering sector that maps specific descriptions to various sorts of executable code. Along with the numerous intensive studies, diverse SCG types that integrate different scenarios and contexts continue to emerge. As the ultimate purpose of SCG, Natural Language-based Source Code Generation (NLSCG) is growing into an attractive and challenging field, as the expressibility and Cites: Reranking for neural semantic parsing
