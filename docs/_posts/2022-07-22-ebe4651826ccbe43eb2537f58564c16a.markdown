Scene flow estimation, which extracts point-wise motion between scenes, is becoming a crucial task in many computer vision tasks. However, all of the existing estimation methods utilize only the unidirectional features, restricting the accuracy and generality. This paper presents a novel scene flow estimation architecture using bidirectional flow embedding layers. The proposed bidirectional layer learns features along both forward and backward directions, enhancing the estimation performance  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
