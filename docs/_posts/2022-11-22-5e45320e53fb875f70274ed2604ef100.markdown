Management scholarship is beginning to grapple with the growing popularity of machine learning (ML) as an analytical tool. While quantitative research in our discipline remains heavily influenced by positivist thinking and statistical modelling underpinned by null hypothesis significance testing, ML is increasingly used to solve technical, computationally demanding problems. In this paper, we argue for a wider, more systematic adoption of the key tenets of ML in quantitative management …
