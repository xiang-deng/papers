Multi-view Spectral Clustering (MvSC) attracts increasing attention due to diverse data sources. However, most existing works are prohibited in out-of-sample predictions and overlook model interpretability and exploration of clustering results. In this paper, a new method for MvSC is proposed via a shared latent space from the Restricted Kernel Machine framework. Through the lens of conjugate feature duality, we cast the weighted kernel principal component analysis problem for MvSC and  Cites: Spectral clustering and transductive learning with multiple views
