Fact-checking is vital for countering fake news. This process requires verifying the truthfulness of a claim by reasoning about multiple pieces of evidence. The current dominant approach depends upon capturing the claim-evidence relations from a claimevidence interaction graph. Existing solutions utilize phrase-level semantics on a single-granularity but ignore other hierarchical features, such as fact-and sentence-level textual semantics and their logical topology. Since the hierarchical features Cites: Fine-grained fact verification with kernel graph attention network
