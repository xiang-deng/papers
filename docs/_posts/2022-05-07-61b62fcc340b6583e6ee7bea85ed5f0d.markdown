Boosted by deep learning, natural language processing (NLP) techniques have recently seen spectacular progress, mainly fueled by breakthroughs both in representation learning with word embeddings (eg word2vec) as well as novel architectures (eg transformers). This success quickly invited researchers to explore the use of NLP techniques to other field, such as computer programming languages, with the promise to automate tasks in software programming (bug detection, code Cites: Break-It-Fix-It: Unsupervised Learning for Program Repair
