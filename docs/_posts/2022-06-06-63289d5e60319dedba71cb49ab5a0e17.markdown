Domain generalization aims to learn a predictive model from multiple different but related source tasks that can generalize well to a target task without the need of accessing any target data. Existing domain generalization methods ignore the relationship between tasks, implicitly assuming that all the tasks are sampled from a stationary environment. Therefore, they can fail when deployed in an evolving environment. To this end, we formulate and study the\emph {evolving domain …
