Reinforcement learning has achieved tremendous success in many complex decision making tasks. When it comes to deploying RL in the real world, safety concerns are usually raised, leading to a growing demand for safe reinforcement learning algorithms, such as in autonomous driving and robotics scenarios. While safety control has a long history, the study of safe RL algorithms is still in the early stages. To establish a good foundation for future research in this thread, in this Cites: Doubly robust bias reduction in infinite horizon off-policy estimation
