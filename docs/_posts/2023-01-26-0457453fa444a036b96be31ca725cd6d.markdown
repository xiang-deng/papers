Human mobility clustering is an important problem for understanding human mobility behaviors (eg, work and school commutes). Existing methods typically contain two steps: choosing or learning a mobility representation and applying a clustering algorithm to the representation. However, these methods rely on strict visiting orders in trajectories and cannot take advantage of multiple types of mobility representations. This paper proposes a novel mobility clustering method for mobility Cites: Dataset cartography: Mapping and diagnosing datasets with
