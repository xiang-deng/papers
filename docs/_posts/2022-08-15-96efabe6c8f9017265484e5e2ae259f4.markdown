Tabular visualization techniques integrate visual representations with tabular data to avoid additional cognitive load caused by splitting users attention. However, most of the existing studies focus on simple flat tables instead of hierarchical tables, whose complex structure limits the expressiveness of visualization results and affects users efficiency in visualization construction. We present HiTailor, a technique for presenting and exploring hierarchical tables. HiTailor constructs an abstract model Cites: Automatic web spreadsheet data extraction
