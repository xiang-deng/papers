One of the most effective ways to solve the problem of knowledge graph completion is embedding-based models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are popular and promising embedding models which can exploit and use the structural information of neighbors in knowledge graphs. The current GNN-based knowledge graph completion methods assume that all neighbors of a node have the importance equally. This assumption which cannot assign different weights to neighbors is Cites: Are Sixteen Heads Really Better than One?
