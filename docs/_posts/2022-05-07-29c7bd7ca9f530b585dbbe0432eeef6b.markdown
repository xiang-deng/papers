Proposing scoring functions to effectively understand, analyze and learn various properties of high dimensional hidden representations of large-scale transformer models like BERT can be a challenging task. In this work, we explore a new direction by studying the topological features of BERT hidden representations using persistent homology (PH). We propose a novel scoring function named persistence scoring function (PSF) which:(i) accurately captures the homology of the high-dimensional Cites: What does BERT look at?
