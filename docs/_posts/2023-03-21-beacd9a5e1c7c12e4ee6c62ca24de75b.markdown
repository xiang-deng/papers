Steganography has received massive attention from the information-hiding community due to its excellent security for covert communication systems. Existing work focuses on improving security on single-modal media while cross-modal media is less explored. However, cross-modal interaction has become a prevalent social manner on current social networks, which arises potential behavioral security issues of single-modal steganography. In this letter, we propose a novel text steganography Cites: VL-Adapter: Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for Vision-and
