Deep learning has achieved impressive results on hyperspectral images (HSIs) classification. Among them, supervised learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and semi-supervised learning graph neural networks (GNNs) are the two main network frameworks. However, 1) the supervised learning CNN faces the problem of high model time complexity as the number of network layers deepens; 2) the semi-supervised learning GNN faces the problem of high spatial complexity due … Cites: ‪Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications‬
