Mining the community structure in real-world networks has always been a popular topic in the complex network field. With the development of complex network research, the study of dynamic network community evolution discovery has become an important field and continues to develop. However, the current community discovery methods are mainly applied to static networks, and some methods applied to dynamic networks have the following problems: 1.
