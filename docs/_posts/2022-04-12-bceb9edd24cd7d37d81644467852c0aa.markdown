The Web provides many data that are encoded using HTML tables. This facilitates rendering them, but obfuscates their structure and makes it difficult for automated business processes to leverage them. This has motivated many authors to work on proposals to extract them as automatically as possible. In this article, we present a new unsupervised proposal that uses a hybrid approach in which a standard computer is used to perform pre and post-processing tasks and a quantum computer Cites: Ten years of webtables
