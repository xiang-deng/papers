Deep Neural Networks (DNN) has transformed the automation of a wide range of industries and finds increasing ubiquity in society. The high complexity of DNN models and its widespread adoption has led to global energy consumption doubling every 3-4 months. Current energy consumption measures largely monitor system wide consumption or make linear assumptions of DNN models. The former approach captures other unrelated energy consumption anomalies, whilst the latter does not Cites: Green AI
