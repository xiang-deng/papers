Lifelong learning without catastrophic forgetting (ie, resiliency) possessed by human intelligence is entangled with sophisticated memory mechanisms in the brain, especially the long-term memory (LM) maintained by Hippocampi. To a certain extent, Transformers have emerged as the counterpart``Brain of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and yet leave the LM component under-explored for lifelong learning settings. This paper presents a method of learning to grow Artificial Hippocampi (ArtiHippo) in  Cites: Learn to grow: A continual structure learning framework for
