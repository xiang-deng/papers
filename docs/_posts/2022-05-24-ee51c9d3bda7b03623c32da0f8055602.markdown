The reliability of neural networks is essential for their use in safety-critical applications. Existing approaches generally aim at improving the robustness of neural networks to either real-world distribution shifts (eg, common corruptions and perturbations, spatial transformations, and natural adversarial examples) or worst-case distribution shifts (eg, optimized adversarial examples). In this work, we propose the Decision Region Quantification (DRQ) algorithm to improve the  Cites: Understanding and mitigating the tradeoff between robustness and
