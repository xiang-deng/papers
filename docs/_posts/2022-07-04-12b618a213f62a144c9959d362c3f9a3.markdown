In this paper, we study nonconvex tensor robust principal component analysis (RPCA) based on the t-SVD. We first propose an alternating projection method, ie, APT, which converges linearly to the ground-truth under the incoherence conditions of tensors. However, as the projection to the low-rank tensor space in APT can be slow, we further propose to speedup such a process by utilizing the property of the tangent space of low-rank. The resulting algorithm, ie, EAPT, is not only more
