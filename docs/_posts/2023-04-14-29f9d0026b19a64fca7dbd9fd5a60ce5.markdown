Sentence-level relation extraction aims to identify the relation between two entities for a given sentence. The existing works mostly focus on obtaining a better entity representation and adopting a multi-label classifier for relation extraction. A major limitation of these works is that they ignore background relational knowledge and the interrelation between entity types and candidate relations. In this work, we propose a new paradigm, Contrastive Learning with Descriptive Relation Prompts (CTL-DRP) Cites: K-adapter: Infusing knowledge into pre-trained models with adapters
