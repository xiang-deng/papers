Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are becoming increasingly essential infrastructures in many applications while suffering from incompleteness issues. The KG completion task (KGC) automatically predicts missing facts based on an incomplete KG. However, existing methods perform unsatisfactorily in real-world scenarios. On the one hand, their performance will dramatically degrade along with the increasing sparsity of KGs. On the other hand, the inference procedure for prediction is an  Cites: Dynamic Anticipation and Completion for Multi-Hop Reasoning
