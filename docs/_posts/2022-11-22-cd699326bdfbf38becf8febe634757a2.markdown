Skeleton-based action recognition aims to predict human actions given human joint coordinates with skeletal interconnections. To model such off-grid data points and their co-occurrences, Transformer-based formulations would be a natural choice. However, Transformers still lag behind state-of-the-art methods using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Transformers assume that the input is permutation-invariant and homogeneous (partially alleviated by positional encoding), which  Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
