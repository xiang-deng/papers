We develop an abstractive summarization framework independent of labeled data for multiple heterogeneous documents.

We also enhance an existing sentence fusion method with a uni-directional language model to prioritize fused sentences with higher sentence probability with the goal of increasing readability. Lastly, we construct a Cites: Sentence centrality revisited for unsupervised summarization
