Image-text bidirectional retrieval is a significant task within cross-modal learning field. The main issue lies on the jointly embedding learning and accurately measuring image-text matching score. Most prior works make use of either intra-modality methods performing within two separate modalities or inter-modality ones combining two modalities tightly. However, intra-modality methods remain ambiguous when learning visual context due to the existence of redundant … Cites: ‪Oscar: Object-semantics aligned pre-training for vision-language …‬
