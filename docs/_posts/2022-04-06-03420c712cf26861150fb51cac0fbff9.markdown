In this paper, a novel path planning algorithm for multiple robots using congestion analysis and control is presented. The algorithm ensures a safe path planning solution by avoiding collisions among robots as well as among robots and humans. For each robot, alternative paths to the goal are realised. By analysing the travelling time of robots on different paths using Petri Nets, the optimal configuration of paths is selected. The prime objective is to avoid congestion when routing many robots into a Cites: Introduction to information retrieval
