A key bottleneck in building automatic extraction models for visually rich documents like invoices is the cost of acquiring the several thousand high-quality labeled documents that are needed to train a model with acceptable accuracy. We propose Selective Labeling to simplify the labeling task to provide yes/no labels for candidate extractions predicted by a model trained on partially labeled documents. We combine this with a custom active learning strategy to find the predictions that the Cites: Cold-start active learning through self-supervised language
