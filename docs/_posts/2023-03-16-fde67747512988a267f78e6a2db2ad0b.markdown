Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to adapt to emerging new classes without forgetting old ones. Traditional CIL models are trained from scratch to continually acquire knowledge as data evolves. Recently, pre-training has achieved substantial progress, making vast pre-trained models (PTMs) accessible for CIL. Contrary to traditional methods, PTMs possess generalizable embeddings, which can be easily transferred. In this work, we revisit CIL with PTMs and argue that the core factors in Cites: Pre-Trained Models: Past, Present and Future
