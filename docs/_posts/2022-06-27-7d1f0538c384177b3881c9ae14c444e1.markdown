Knowledge graph is a knowledge representation technique that helps representing entities and relations in a machine understandable way. This promising trend suffers from the problem of incompleteness that was best solved by link prediction. Indeed, link prediction is the most successful method for understanding the structure of the large knowledge graphs. Knowledge graph embedding KGE is one of the best link prediction methods. Its effectiveness is mainly affected by the accuracy of learning
