To alleviate the scarcity of manually annotated data in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, data augmentation methods can be applied to automatically generate labeled data and improve performance of existing methods. However, based on manipulations of the input text, current techniques may generate too many noisy and mislabeled samples. In this paper we propose COntext SImilarity-based data augmentation for NER (COSINER), a method for NER data augmentation based on …
