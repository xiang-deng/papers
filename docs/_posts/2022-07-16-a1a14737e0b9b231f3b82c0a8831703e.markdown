Event trigger detection, entity mention recognition, event argument extraction, and relation extraction are the four important tasks in information extraction that have been performed jointly (Joint Information Extraction-JointIE) to avoid error propagation and leverage dependencies between the task instances (ie, event triggers, entity mentions, relations, and event arguments). However, previous JointIE models often assume heuristic manually-designed dependency between the task Cites: Bart: Denoising sequence-to-sequence pre-training for natural
