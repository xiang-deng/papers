Today s trend of building ever larger language models (LLMs), while pushing the performance of natural language processing, adds significant latency to the inference stage. We observe that due to the diminishing returns of adding parameters to LLMs, a smaller model could make the same prediction as a costly LLM for a majority of queries. Based on this observation, we design Tabi, an inference system with a multi-level inference engine that serves queries using small …
