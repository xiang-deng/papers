Community search is a problem that seeks cohesive and connected subgraphs in a graph that satisfy certain topology constraints, eg, degree constraints. The majority of existing works focus exclusively on the topology and ignore the nodes influence in the communities. To tackle this deficiency, influential community search is further proposed to include the node s influence. Each node has a weight, namely influence value, in the influential community search problem to represent its network influence  Cites: Group recommendation: Semantics and efficiency
