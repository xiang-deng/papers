Human Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging task that requires to distinguish the interaction between a human-object pair. Attention based relation parsing is a popular and effective strategy utilized in HOI. However, current methods execute relation parsing in a bottom-up manner. We argue that the independent use of the bottom-up parsing strategy in HOI is counter-intuitive and could lead to the diffusion of attention. Therefore, we introduce a novel knowledge-guided top-down Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
