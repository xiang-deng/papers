The benefits of overparameterization for the overall performance of modern machine learning (ML) models are well known. However, the effect of overparameterization at a more granular level of data subgroups is less understood. Recent empirical studies demonstrate encouraging results:(i) when groups are not known, overparameterized models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) perform better on minority groups;(ii) when groups are known, ERM on data subsampled to equalize group Cites: Just train twice: Improving group robustness without training group
