Artificial emotional intelligence (AEI) is an important ability for intelligent systems. Representing emotional states as a continuous sentiment intensity could achieve a more fine-grained sentiment application than traditional categorical approaches. By using sentiment intensity, the main challenge of the existing variational autoencoder methods lies in distinguishing emotional information from semantic information. Practically, it is difficult to ensure that the input training texts do not contain any …
