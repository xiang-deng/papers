Linear algebra is an ideal tool to redefine symbolic methods with the goal to achieve better scalability. In solving the abductive Horn propositional problem, the transpose of a program matrix has been exploited to develop an efficient exhaustive method. While it is competitive with other symbolic methods, there is much room for improvement in practice. In this paper, we propose to optimize the linear algebraic method for abduction using partial evaluation. This improvement considerably Cites: End-to-end differentiable proving
