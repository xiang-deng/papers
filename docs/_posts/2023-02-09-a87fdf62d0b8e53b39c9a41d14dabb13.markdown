Abstract Machine Learning plays a crucial role for many innovations for Cyber-Physical Systems such as production systems. On the one hand, this is due to the availability of more and more data in ever better quality. On the other hand, the demands on the systems are also increasing: Production systems have to support more and more product variants, saving resources is increasingly in focus and international competition is forcing companies to innovate faster.
