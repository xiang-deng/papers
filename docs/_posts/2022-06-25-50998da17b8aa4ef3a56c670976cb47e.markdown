Abstract Knowledge graphs are multi-relational data that contain massive entities and relations. As an effective graph representation technique based on deep learning, graph neural network has reported outstanding performance for modeling knowledge graphs in recent studies. However, previous graph neural network-based models have not fully considered the heterogeneity of knowledge graphs. Furthermore, the attention mechanism has demonstrated its great potential in many Cites: Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text
