Individual differences among different subjects pose a great challenge to motor imagery (MI) decoding. Multi-source transfer learning (MSTL) is one of the most promising ways to reduce individual differences, which can utilize rich information and align the data distribution among different subjects. However, most MSTL methods in MI-BCI combine all data in the source subjects into a single mixed domain, which will ignore the effect of important samples and the large differences in Cites: Fine-tuning can distort pretrained features and underperform out-of
