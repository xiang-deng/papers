Self-supervision based on the information extracted from large knowledge graphs has been shown to improve the generalization of language models, in zero-shot evaluation on various downstream language reasoning tasks. Since these improvements are reported in aggregate, however, little is known about (i) how to select the appropriate knowledge for solid performance across tasks,(ii) how to combine this knowledge with neural language models, and (iii) how these pairings Cites: Prompting contrastive explanations for commonsense reasoning
