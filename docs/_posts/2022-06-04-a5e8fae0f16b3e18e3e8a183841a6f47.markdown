We present Neural Probabilistic Soft Logic (NeuPSL), a novel neuro-symbolic (NeSy) framework that unites state-of-the-art symbolic reasoning with the low-level perception of deep neural networks. To explicitly model the boundary between neural and symbolic representations, we introduce NeSy Energy-Based Models, a general family of energy-based models that combine neural and symbolic reasoning. Using this framework, we show how to seamlessly integrate neural and symbolic … Cites: ‪Programming with a differentiable forth interpreter‬
