Polar codes are closer to the Shannon limit with lower complexity in coding and decoding. As traditional decoding techniques suffer from high latency and low throughput, with the development of deep learning technology, some deep learning-based decoding methods have been proposed to solve these problems. Usually, the deep neural network is treated as a black box and learns to map the polar codes with noise to the original information code directly. In fact, it is difficult for the network to Cites: Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for
