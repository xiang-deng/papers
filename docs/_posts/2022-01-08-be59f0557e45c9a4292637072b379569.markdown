Computer-aided medical image segmentation has been applied widely in diagnosis and treatment to obtain clinically useful information of shapes and volumes of target organs and tissues. In the past several years, convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods (eg, U-Net) have dominated this area, but still suffered from inadequate long-range information capturing. Hence, recent work presented computer vision Transformer variants for medical image segmentation tasks and Cites: Delight: Very deep and light-weight transformer
