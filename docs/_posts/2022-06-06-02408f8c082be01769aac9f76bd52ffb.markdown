Recent knowledge graph (KG) embeddings have been advanced by hyperbolic geometry due to its superior capability for representing hierarchies. The topological structures of real-world KGs, however, are rather heterogeneous, ie, a KG is composed of multiple distinct hierarchies and non-hierarchical graph structures. Therefore, a homogeneous (either Euclidean or hyperbolic) geometry is not sufficient for fairly representing such heterogeneous structures.
