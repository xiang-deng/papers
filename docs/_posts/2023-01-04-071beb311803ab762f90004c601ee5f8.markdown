Social robotics is intended for interacting and communicating with people. This communication needs to be natural and fluid, similar to a human conversation. For instance, people do not always use exactly the same words when transmitting the same message in different situations. One way to imitate this is through paraphrase generation, allowing the robot to use different sentences while keeping the same meaning. In this paper we propose the application of deep learning models to …
