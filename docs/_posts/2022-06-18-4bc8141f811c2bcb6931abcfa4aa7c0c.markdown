State-of-the-art recommender system (RS) mostly rely on complex deep neural network (DNN) model structure, which makes it difficult to provide explanations along with RS decisions. Previous researchers have proved that providing explanations along with recommended items can help users make informed decisions and improve their trust towards the uninterpretable blackbox system. In model-agnostic explainable recommendation, system designers deploy a separate explanation …
