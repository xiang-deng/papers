The existing Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) has made some achievements, and it is applied in many tasks, such as criminal investigations. Previous approaches realised extraction by constructing different networks, but they did not fully exploit the original information of the data, which led to low extraction precision. Moreover, the extraction precision will also be decreased when the model is attacked by adversarial samples. To address the above problems, a new model CL-ECPE is
