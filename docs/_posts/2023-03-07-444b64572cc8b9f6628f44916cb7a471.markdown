In this paper, we investigate the impact of optimal hyper-parameter configuration in relational topic models. The main goal is to validate the hypothesis that single-objective Bayesian Optimization (BO) can discover a hyper-parameter setting that leads a set of relational topic models to simultaneously ensure good prediction capabilities and significant topics from a qualitative perspective. Our research, as a result of a comparative analysis performed on 7 state-of-the-art models, 5 …
