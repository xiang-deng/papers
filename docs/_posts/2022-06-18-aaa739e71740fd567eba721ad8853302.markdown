Link Prediction (LP) aims at tackling Knowledge Graph incompleteness by inferring new, missing facts from the already known ones. The rise of novel Machine Learning techniques has led researchers to develop LP models that represent Knowledge Graph elements as vectors in an embedding space. These models can outperform traditional approaches and they can be employed in multiple downstream tasks; nonetheless, they tend to be opaque, and are mostly regarded as black boxes.
