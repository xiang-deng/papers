The CrisisFACTS Track aims to tackle challenges such as multi-stream fact-finding in the domain of event tracking; participants systems extract important facts from several disaster-related events while incorporating the temporal order. We propose a combination of retrieval, reranking, and the well-known Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) frameworks. In the former two modules, we explore various methods including an entity-based baseline, pre  Cites: ASPECTNEWS: Aspect-Oriented Summarization of News Documents
