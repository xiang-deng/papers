The belief function approach to uncertainty quantification as proposed in the Demspter-Shafer theory of evidence is established upon the general mathematical models for set-valued observations, called random sets. Set-valued predictions are the most natural representations of uncertainty in machine learning. In this paper, we introduce a concept called epistemic deep learning based on the random-set interpretation of belief functions to model epistemic learning in deep neural networks  Cites: Learning from the Wisdom of Crowds by Minimax Entropy.
