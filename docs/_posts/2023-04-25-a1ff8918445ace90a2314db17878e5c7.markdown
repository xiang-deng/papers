Kobayashi et al. have recently proposed NeuGuS, a framework of neural-network-guided synthesis of logical formulas or simple program fragments, where a neural network is first trained based on data, and then a logical formula over integers is constructed by using the weights and biases of the trained network as hints. The previous method was, however, restricted the class of formulas of quantifier-free linear integer arithmetic. In this paper, we propose a NeuGuS method for the Cites: Learning invariants using decision trees and implication
