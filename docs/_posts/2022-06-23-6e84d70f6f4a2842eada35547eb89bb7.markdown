Prior work on constructing challenging tabular inference data centered primarily on human annotation or automatic synthetic generation. Both techniques have their own set of issues. Human annotation, despite its diversity and superior reasoning, struggles from scaling concerns. Synthetic data, on the other hand, despite its scalability, suffers from lack of linguistic and reasoning diversity. In this paper, we address both of these concerns by presenting a recasting approach that semi Cites: Transforming question answering datasets into natural language
