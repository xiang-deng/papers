Generative commonsense reasoning refers to the ability of a language model to generate a sentence with a given concept-set based on compositional generalization and commonsense reasoning. In the CommonGen challenge, which evaluates the capability of generative commonsense reasoning, language models continue to exhibit low performances and struggle to leverage knowledge representation from humans. Therefore, we propose PU-GEN to leverage human-centered knowledge in  Cites: Atomic: An atlas of machine commonsense for if-then reasoning
