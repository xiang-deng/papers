Vision-and-language navigation (VLN), a frontier study aiming to pave the way for general-purpose robots, has been a hot topic in the computer vision and natural language processing community. The VLN task requires an agent to navigate to a goal location following natural language instructions in unfamiliar environments. Recently, transformer-based models have gained significant improvements on the VLN task. Since the attention mechanism in the transformer architecture can better …
