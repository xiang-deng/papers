In the future, powerful AI systems may be deployed in high-stakes settings, where a single failure could be catastrophic. One technique for improving AI safety in high- stakes settings is adversarial training, which uses an adversary to generate examples to train on in order to achieve better worst-case performance. In this work, we used a language generation task as a testbed for achieving high reliability through adversarial training. We created a series of adversarial training techniques Cites: Distributionally robust neural networks for group shifts: On the
