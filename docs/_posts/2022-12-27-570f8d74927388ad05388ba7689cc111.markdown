Previous studies show that neural machine translation (NMT) systems produce translations with higher quality when highly similar sentences (ie fuzzy matches; FMs) to a given input sentence can be found in the NMT training data. This study explores the usefulness of FMs for the task of sentence-level quality estimation (QE) for NMT. To this end, fuzzy matches are integrated into the QE architecture that utilizes a pre_trained XLM RoBERTa model, through a data augmentation …
