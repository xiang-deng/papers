Modern production has stricter requirements for the reliability of complex systems; thus, it is meaningful to estimate the health of complex systems. A complex system has diverse observation features and complex internal structures, which have been difficult to study with regard to health condition estimation. To describe continuous and gradually changing time-based characteristics of a complex system s health condition, this study develops a feature selection model based on the information Cites: Cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction with graph lstms
