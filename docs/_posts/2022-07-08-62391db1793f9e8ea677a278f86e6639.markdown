The demand for computing is continuing to grow exponentially. This growth will translate to exponential growth in computing s energy consumption unless improvements in its energy-efficiency can outpace increases in its demand. Yet, after decades of research, further improving energy-efficiency is becoming increasingly challenging, as it is already highly optimized. As a result, at some point, increases in computing demand are likely to outpace increases in its energy-efficiency, potentially Cites: Searching for Efficient Transformers for Language Modeling
