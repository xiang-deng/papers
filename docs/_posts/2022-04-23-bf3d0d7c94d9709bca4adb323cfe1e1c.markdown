Molecular property prediction models based on machine learning algorithms have become important tools to triage unpromising lead molecules in the early stages of drug discovery. Compared with the mainstream descriptor-and graph-based methods for molecular property predictions, SMILES-based methods can directly extract molecular features from SMILES without human expert knowledge, but they require more powerful algorithms for feature extraction and a larger amount of data Cites: Strategies for pre-training graph neural networks
