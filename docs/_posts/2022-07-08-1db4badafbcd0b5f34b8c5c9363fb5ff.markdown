Big data processing at the production scale presents a highly complex environment for resource optimization (RO), a problem crucial for meeting performance goals and budgetary constraints of analytical users. The RO problem is challenging because it involves a set of decisions (the partition count, placement of parallel instances on machines, and resource allocation to each instance), requires multi-objective optimization (MOO), and is compounded by the scale and complexity of big data Cites: KILT: a benchmark for knowledge intensive language tasks
