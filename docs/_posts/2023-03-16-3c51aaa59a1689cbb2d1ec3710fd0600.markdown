In this paper, we present a prompting framework called LLMCS that leverages large language models, such as code-davinci-002 of GPT-3, to perform few-shot conversational query rewriting for conversational search. We explore three prompting methods to generate multiple query rewrites and hypothetical responses, and propose aggregating them into an integrated representation that can robustly represent the user s real contextual search intent.
