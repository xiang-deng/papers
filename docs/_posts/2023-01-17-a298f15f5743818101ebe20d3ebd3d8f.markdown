Surface quality is a main quality factor due to the importance of aesthetics, appearance, and perceived quality of products. Even when the process condition is optimized with the mold at the molding trial site, the process parameters still need to be adjusted again after the mold is transferred to the production site because of the dependency of surface quality on the molding machine, auxiliary equipment, and ambient conditions. In this study, transfer learning was employed to increase the …
