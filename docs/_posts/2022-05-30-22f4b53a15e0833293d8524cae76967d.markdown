The backdoor attack has become an emerging threat for Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. A victim model trained on poisoned data can be embedded with a  backdoor , making it predict the adversary-specified output (eg, the positive sentiment label) on inputs satisfying the trigger pattern (eg, containing a certain keyword). In this paper, we demonstrate that it s possible to design an effective and stealthy backdoor attack by iteratively injecting  triggers  into a small set  Cites: Mind the Style of Text!
