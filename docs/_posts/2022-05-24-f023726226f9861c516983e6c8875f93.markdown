As a key step to endow the neural network with nonlinear factors, the activation function is crucial to the performance of the network. This paper proposes an Efficient Asymmetric Nonlinear Activation Function (EANAF) for deep neural networks. Compared with existing activation functions, the proposed EANAF requires less computational effort, and it is self-regularized, asymmetric and non-monotonic. These desired characteristics facilitate the outstanding performance of the proposed … Cites: ‪Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading‬
