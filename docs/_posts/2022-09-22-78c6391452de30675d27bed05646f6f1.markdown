Structural defects are abundant in solids, and vital to the macroscopic materials properties. However, a defect-property linkage typically requires significant efforts from experiments or simulations, and often contains limited information due to the breadth of nanoscopic design space. Here we report a graph neural network (GNN)-based approach to achieve direct translation between mesoscale crystalline structures and atom-level properties, emphasizing the effects of structural defects …
