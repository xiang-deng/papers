Point cloud segmentation with scene-level annotations is a promising but challenging task. Currently, the most popular way is to employ the class activation map (CAM) to locate discriminative regions and then generate point-level pseudo labels from scene-level annotations. However, these methods always suffer from the point imbalance among categories, as well as the sparse and incomplete supervision from CAM. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted hypergraph  Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
