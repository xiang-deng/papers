The retrieval model is an indispensable component for real-world knowledge-intensive tasks, eg, open-domain question answering (ODQA). As separate retrieval skills are annotated for different datasets, recent work focuses on customized methods, limiting the model transferability and scalability. In this work, we propose a modular retriever where individual modules correspond to key skills that can be reused across datasets. Our approach supports flexible skill configurations based on Cites: Simple Entity-Centric Questions Challenge Dense Retrievers
