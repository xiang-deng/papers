Visual reasoning between visual images and natural language remains a long-standing challenge in computer vision. Conventional deep supervision methods target at finding answers to the questions relying on the datasets containing only a limited amount of images with textual ground-truth descriptions. Facing learning with limited labels, it is natural to expect to constitute a larger scale dataset consisting of several million visual data annotated with texts, but this approach is extremely time …
