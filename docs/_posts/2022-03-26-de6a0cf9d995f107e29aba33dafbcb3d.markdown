Abstract Knowledge graph embedding acts as a pivotal role in predicting the missing information in knowledge graphs (KGs). Due to the evolving nature of real-world KGs, one requires the ability to make predictions for newly emerging entities besides those already observed at training time. Current studies have made great efforts to develop a neighborhood aggregator and embed out-of-knowledge-graph (OOKG) entities inductively, with less focus on exploiting the similarity between the existing Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
