Distributed machine learning paradigms have benefited from the concurrent advancement of deep learning and the Internet of Things (IoT), among which federated learning is one of the most promising frameworks, where a central server collaborates with local learners to train a global model. The inherent heterogeneity of IoT devices, ie, non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data, and the inconsistent communication network environment results in the bottleneck of a Cites: Adversarial examples for evaluating reading comprehension systems
