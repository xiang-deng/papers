Artificial intelligence (AI) for software engineering (SE) tasks has recently achieved promising performance. In this paper, we investigate to what extent the pre-trained language model truly understands those SE tasks such as code search, code summarization, etc. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on a board set of AI for SE (AI4SE) tasks by feeding them with variant inputs: 1) with various masking rates and 2) with sufficient input subset method. Then, the trained models are Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
