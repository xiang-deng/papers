Fake news is a growing challenge for social networks and media. Detection of fake news always has been a problem for many years, but after the evolution of social networks and increasing speed of news dissemination in recent years has been considered again. There are several approaches to solving this problem, one of which is to detect fake news based on its text style using deep neural networks. In recent years, one of the most used forms of deep neural networks for natural Cites: Dissecting contextual word embeddings: Architecture and
