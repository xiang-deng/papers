The unabated mystique of large-scale neural networks, such as the CLIP dual image- and-text encoder, popularized automatically generated art. Increasingly more sophisticated generators enhanced the artworks  realism and visual appearance, and creative prompt engineering enabled stylistic expression. Guided by an artist-in- the-loop ideal, we design a gradient-based generator to produce collages. It requires the human artist to curate libraries of image patches and to describe (with prompts) Cites: On the opportunities and risks of foundation models
