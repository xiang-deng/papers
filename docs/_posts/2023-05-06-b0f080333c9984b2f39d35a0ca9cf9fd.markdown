Few-shot event detection (ED) has been widely studied, while this brings noticeable discrepancies, eg, various motivations, tasks, and experimental settings, that hinder the understanding of models for future progress. This paper presents a thorough empirical study, a unified view of ED models, and a better unified baseline. For fair evaluation, we choose two practical settings: low-resource setting to assess generalization ability and class-transfer setting for transferability. We compare ten  Cites: Label semantics for few shot named entity recognition
