Gaitrecognitionis acriticalarea ofresearch in biometricidentification, whichhas traditionally required complex instrumentation and systems for detection and analysis. However, wearable devices, suchassmartglassesforgaitrecognition, havetheadvantagesofbeinglesscomplex more user-friendly than traditional vision-based systems. In this thesis an approach for gait recognition is presented using a set of smart glasses for gait data acquisition and deep learning as universal feature extractors.
