Generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) data--that is, data from domains unseen during training--is a key challenge in modern machine learning, which has only recently received much attention. Some existing approaches propose leveraging larger models and pre-training on larger datasets. In this paper, we provide new insights in applying these approaches. Concretely, we show that larger models and larger datasets need to be simultaneously leveraged to improve OOD performance Cites: Accuracy on the line: on the strong correlation between out-of
