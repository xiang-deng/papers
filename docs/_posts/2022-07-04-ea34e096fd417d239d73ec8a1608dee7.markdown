In recent years, neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved unprecedented performance in automated translation of resource-rich languages. However, it has not yet managed to achieve a comparable performance over the many low-resource languages and specialized translation domains, mainly due its tendency to overfit small training sets and consequently strive on new data. For this reason, in this paper we propose a novel approach to regularize the training of NMT models to improve …
