Knowledge graph is ubiquitous and plays an important role in many real-world applications, including recommender systems, question answering, fact-checking, and so on. However, most of the knowledge graphs are incomplete which can hamper their practical usage. Fortunately, knowledge graph completion (KGC) can mitigate this problem by inferring missing edges in the knowledge graph according to the existing information. In this paper, we propose a novel KGC method named ABM  Cites: Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text
