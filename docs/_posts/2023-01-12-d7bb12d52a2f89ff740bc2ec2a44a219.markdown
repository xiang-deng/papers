The challenge of information extraction (IE) lies in the diversity of label schemas and the heterogeneity of structures. Traditional methods require task-specific model design and rely heavily on expensive supervision, making them difficult to generalize to new schemas. In this paper, we decouple IE into two basic abilities, structuring and conceptualizing, which are shared by different tasks and schemas. Based on this paradigm, we propose to universally model various IE tasks with Unified Semantic Cites: Entity, relation, and event extraction with contextualized span
