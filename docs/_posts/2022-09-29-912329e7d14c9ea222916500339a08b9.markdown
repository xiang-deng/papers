The automatic analysis of patents is still one of the main challenges in R&D, particularly in terms of establishing automatic states of the art. Indeed, this is still mostly done manually, which is very time-consuming.

In this paper we present an end-to-end tool that allows us to map the main trends in term of research directions in a sector in a few  Cites: Text summarization with pretrained encoders
