Deep-learning of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is creating highly functional tools that are, unfortunately, as hard to interpret as their natural counterparts. While it is possible to identify functional modules in natural brains using technologies such as fMRI, we do not have at our disposal similarly robust methods for artificial neural networks. Ideally, understanding which parts of an artificial neural network perform what function might help us to address a number of vexing problems in ANN Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
