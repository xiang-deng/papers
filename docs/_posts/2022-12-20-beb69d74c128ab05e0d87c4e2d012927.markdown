Clustering analysis  primary purpose is to divide a dataset into a finite number of segments based on the similarities between items. In recent years, a significant amount of study has focused on the spatio-temporal aspects of clustering. However, clusters are no longer regarded as static objects since changes influence them in the underlying population. This paper describes an R package implementing the MONIC framework for tracing the evolution of clusters extracted from temporal datasets. The …
