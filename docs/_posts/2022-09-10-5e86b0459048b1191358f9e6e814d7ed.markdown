A Recurrent Neural Network that operates on several time lags, called an RNN (p), is the natural generalization of an Autoregressive ARX (p) model. It is a powerful forecasting tool when different time scales can influence a given phenomenon, as it happens in the energy sector where hourly, daily, weekly and yearly interactions coexist. The cost-effective BPTT is the industry standard as learning algorithm for RNNs. We prove that, when training RNN (p) models, other learning algorithms turn  Cites: A unified framework of online learning algorithms for training
