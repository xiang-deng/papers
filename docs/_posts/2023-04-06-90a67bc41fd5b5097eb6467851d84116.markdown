Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) can effectively learn node representations via aggregating neighbors based on the relation graph. However, despite a few exceptions, most of the previous work in this line does not consider the topical semantics underlying the edges, making the node representations less effective and the learned relation between nodes hard to explain. For instance, the current GNNs make us usually don t know what is the  Cites: Well-Read Students Learn Better: On the Importance of Pre
