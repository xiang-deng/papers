Hypergraphs, as a powerful representation of information, effectively and naturally depict complex and non-pair-wise relationships in the real world. Hypergraph representation learning is useful for exploring complex relationships implicit in hypergraphs. However, most methods focus on the 1-order neighborhoods and ignore the higher order neighborhood relationships among data on the hypergraph structure. These often result in underutilization of hypergraph structure. In this paper  Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
