Generating a coherent story is a challenging task in natural language processing, which requires maintaining the coherence of plots and inter-sentence semantics throughout the generated text. While existing generation models can generate texts with good intra-sentence coherence, it is still difficult to plan a coherent plot and inter-sentence semantics throughout the text. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-granularity constraints text generation model, which constrains at the token level and Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
