Vision–language navigation (VLN) is a challenging task, which guides an agent to navigate in a realistic environment by natural language instructions. Sequence-to-sequence modeling is one of the most prospective architectures for the task, which achieves the agent navigation goal by a sequence of moving actions. The line of work has led to the state-of-the-art performance. Recently, several studies showed that the beam-search decoding during the inference can result in promising …
