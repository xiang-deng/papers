Estimating the accuracy of an automatically constructed knowledge graph (KG) becomes a challenging task as the KG often contains a large number of entities and triples. Generally, two major components information extraction (IE) and entity linking (EL) are involved in KG construction. However, the existing approaches just focus on evaluating the triple accuracy that indicates the IE quality, completely ignoring the entity accuracy. Motivated by the fact that the major advance of machines is the Cites: DocRED: A Large-Scale Document-Level Relation Extraction
