The lack of robust representation learning techniques tailored for relational data has led to the underwhelming application of ML models to handle database relevant downstream tasks. Recent works that attempt to embed tabular data into a low dimensional latent space have focused solely on Web tables. A relational database is quite different from a Web table corpus and is way more sophisticated. Existing approaches cannot handle the intricacy of relational databases and often fail to learn …
