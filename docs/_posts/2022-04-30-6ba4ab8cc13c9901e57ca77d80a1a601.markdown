In the last decade Sentiment analysis has been an interesting research topic in natural language processing (NLP) and data mining fields. We have noticed that deep neural network (DNN) models are always applied in sentiment analysis researches to obtain good results. There are many neural architectures which are applied for sentiment analysis. Among these architectures, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are the most used ones. In this contribution, we collected our dataset Cites: CD (2014). GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation
