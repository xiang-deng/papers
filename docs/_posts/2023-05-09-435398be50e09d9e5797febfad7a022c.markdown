As a new cyber-attack method in power cyber physical systems, false-data-injection attacks (FDIAs) mainly disturb the operating state of power systems by tampering with the measurement data of sensors, thereby avoiding bad-data detection by the power grid and threatening the security of power systems. However, existing FDIA detection methods usually only focus on the detection feature extraction between false data and normal data, ignoring the feature correlation that easily produces  Cites: Blockwise Self-Attention for Long Document Understanding
