We study first-order methods for constrained min-max optimization. Existing methods either requires two gradient calls or two projections in each iteration, which may be costly in applications. In this paper, we first show that the Optimistic Gradient (OG) method, a single-call single-projection algorithm, has $ O (\frac {1}{\sqrt {T}}) $ convergence rate for inclusion problems with operators that satisfy the weak Minty variation inequality (MVI). Our second result is the first single-call single-projection  Cites: Stochastic variance reduction methods for policy evaluation
