Network architecture search (NAS), in particular the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) method, has shown a great power to learn excellent model architectures on the specific dataset of interest. In contrast to using a fixed dataset, in this work, we focus on a different but important scenario for NAS: how to refine a deployed network s model architecture to enhance its robustness with the guidance of a few collected and misclassified examples that are degraded by some real-world Cites: Training EfficientNets at supercomputer scale: 83% ImageNet top
