The ability to reason about tabular or semistructured knowledge is a fundamental problem for today s Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. While significant progress has been achieved in the direction of tabular reasoning, these advances are limited to English due to the absence of multilingual benchmark datasets for semi- structured data. In this paper, we use machine translation methods to construct a multilingual tabular natural language inference (TNLI) dataset, namely XINFOTABS Cites: Open question answering over tables and text
