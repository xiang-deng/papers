State-of-the-art methods on conversational recommender systems (CRS) leverage external knowledge to enhance both items and contextual words representations to achieve high quality recommendations and responses generation. However, the representations of the items and words are usually modeled in two separated semantic spaces, which leads to misalignment issue between them. Consequently, this will cause the CRS to only achieve a sub-optimal ranking performance Cites: Conversational multi-hop reasoning with neural commonsense
