k-nearest-neighbor machine translation (NN-MT), proposed by Khandelwal et al.(2021), has achieved many state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks. Although effective, NN-MT requires conducting NN searches through the large datastore for each decoding step during inference, prohibitively increasing the decoding cost and thus leading to the difficulty for the deployment in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose to move the time-consuming NN search Cites: BAM! Born-Again Multi-Task Networks for Natural Language
