The adaptive immune system has the extraordinary ability to produce a broad range of immunoglobulins that can bind a wide variety of antigens. During adaptive immune responses, activated B cells duplicate and undergo somatic hypermutation in their B-cell receptor (BCR) genes, resulting in clonal families of diversified B cells that can be related back to a common ancestor. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled the high-throughput characterization of B …
