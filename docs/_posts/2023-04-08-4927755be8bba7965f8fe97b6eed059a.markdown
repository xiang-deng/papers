Open-Domain Question Answering (Open-Domain QA) aims to answer any factoid questions from users. Recent progress in Open-Domain QA adopts the retriever-reader structure, which has proven effective. Retriever methods are mainly categorized as sparse retrievers and dense retrievers. In recent work, the dense retriever showed a stronger semantic interpretation than the sparse retriever. When training a dual-encoder dense retriever for document retrieval and reranking, there  Cites: Open-domain Question Answering
