In this position paper, we propose a new approach to generating a type of knowledge base (KB) from text, based on question generation and entity linking. We argue that the proposed type of KB has many of the key advantages of a traditional symbolic KB: in particular, it consists of small modular components, which can be combined compositionally to answer complex queries, including relational queries and queries involving multi-hop inferences. However, unlike a traditional KB, this  Cites: QANom: Question-answer driven SRL for nominalizations
