Human data labeling is an important and expensive task at the heart of supervised learning systems. Hierarchies help humans understand and organize concepts. We ask whether and how concept hierarchies can inform the design of annotation interfaces to improve labeling quality and efficiency. We study this question through annotation of vaccine misinformation, where the labeling task is difficult and highly subjective. We investigate 6 user interface designs for crowdsourcing hierarchical …
