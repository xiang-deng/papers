Purpose: A preliminary version of a paraphasia classification algorithm (henceforth called ParAlg) has previously been shown to be a viable method for coding picture naming errors. The purpose of this study is to present an updated version of ParAlg, which uses multinomial classification, and comprehensively evaluate its performance when using two different forms of transcribed input. Method: A subset of 11,999 archival responses produced on the Philadelphia Naming Test were classified into Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
