Source code representation with deep learning techniques is an important research field. There have been many studies that learn sequential or structural information for code representation. But sequence-based models and non-sequence-models both have their limitations. Researchers attempt to incorporate structural information to sequence-based models, but they only mine part of token-level hierarchical structure information. In this paper, we analyze how the complete hierarchical structure Cites: Dawn Drain
