Modern data analysis applications require the ability to provide on-demand integration of data sources while offering a user-friendly query interface. Traditional methods for answering queries using views, focused on a rather static setting, fail to address such requirements. To overcome these issues, we propose a full fledged, GLAV-based data integration approach based on graph-based constructs. The extensibility of graphs allows us to extend the traditional framework for data  Cites: Minicon: A scalable algorithm for answering queries using views
