Our intention is to provide a definitive reference on what it would take to safely make use of predictive models in the absence of a solution to the Eliciting Latent Knowledge problem. Furthermore, we believe that large language models can be understood as such predictive models of the world, and that such a conceptualization raises significant opportunities for their safe yet powerful use via carefullly conditioning them to predict desirable outputs. Unfortunately, such approaches also Cites: PromptChainer: Chaining Large Language Model Prompts through
