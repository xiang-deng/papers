The brain is a complex dynamic system that constantly evolves. Characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain activity is fundamental to understanding how brain works. Current studies with functional connectivity and linear models are limited by low temporal resolution and insufficient model capacity. With a generative variational auto encoder (VAE), the present study mapped the high-dimensional transient co-activity patterns (CAPs) of functional magnetic resonance imaging data Cites: Regularizing and optimizing LSTM language models
