Energy management systems are an important tool for increasing the energy efficiency of buildings. However, the widespread availability of such systems is offset by the complexity and high costs of implementation, as well as a lack of data. These obstacles can be addressed by using standardized digital twins of technical components. In combination with homogeneous semantics and standardized interfaces as uniform access points to information, the implementation of an energy …
