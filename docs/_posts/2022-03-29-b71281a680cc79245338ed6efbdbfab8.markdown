Aspect-level sentiment classification, a fine-grained sentiment analysis task which provides entire and intensive results, has been a research focus in recent years. However, the performance of neural network models is largely limited by the small scale of datasets for aspect-level sentiment classification due to the challenges to label such data. In this paper, we propose an aspect-level sentiment classification model based on Attention-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-BiLSTM) Cites: Aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network
