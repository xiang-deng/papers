The sliding window approach provides an elegant way to handle contexts of sizes larger than the Transformer s input window, for tasks like language modeling. Here we extend this approach to the sequence-to-sequence task of document parsing. For this, we exploit recent progress in transition-based parsing to implement a parser with synchronous sliding windows over source and target. We develop an oracle and a parser for document-level AMR by expanding on Structured-BART such that it Cites: Efficient long-text understanding with short-text models
