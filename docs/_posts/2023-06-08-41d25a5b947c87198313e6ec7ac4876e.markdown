Extracting generalized and robust representations is a major challenge in emotion recognition in conversations (ERC). To address this, we propose a supervised adversarial contrastive learning (SACL) framework for learning class-spread structured representations. The framework applies contrast-aware adversarial training to generate worst-case samples and uses a joint class-spread contrastive learning objective on both original and adversarial samples. It can effectively utilize …
