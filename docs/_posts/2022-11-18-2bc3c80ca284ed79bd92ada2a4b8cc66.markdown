Modern deep learning systems are fragile and do not generalize well under distribution shifts. While much promising work has been accomplished to address these concerns, a systematic study of the role of optimizers and their out-of-distribution generalization performance has not been undertaken. In this study, we examine the performance of popular first-order optimizers for different classes of distributional shift under empirical risk minimization and invariant risk minimization  Cites: Accuracy on the line: on the strong correlation between out-of
