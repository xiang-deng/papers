Fundamental modelling differences between hybrid and endto-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems create large diversity and complementarity among them. This paper investigates multi-pass rescoring and cross adaptation based system combination approaches for hybrid TDNN and Conformer E2E ASR systems. In multi-pass rescoring, state-ofthe-art hybrid LF-MMI trained CNN-TDNN system featuring speed perturbation, SpecAugment and Bayesian learning hidden …
