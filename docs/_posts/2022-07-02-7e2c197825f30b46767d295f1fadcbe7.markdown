Prediction over tabular data is often a crucial task in many real-life applications. Recent advances in deep learning give rise to various deep models for tabular data prediction. A common and essential step in these models is to vectorize raw input features in tabular data into dense embeddings. Choosing a suitable dimension for each feature is challenging yet necessary to improve model s performance and reduce memory cost of model parameters. Existing solutions to embedding
