After more than 10 years of intensive optimization, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have now reached the point where the step towards their commercialization is expected. In order to move in this direction, the upscaling of devices is mandatory. However, the metal electrodes employed in the highest performing PSCs constitute a major obstacle, being both costly and unstable. In this review, the replacement of metal electrodes with carbon (C) electrodes in high-performing perovskite solar modules …
