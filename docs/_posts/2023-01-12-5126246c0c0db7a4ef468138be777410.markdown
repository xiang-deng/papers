Reinforcement learning policy evaluation problems are often modeled as finite or discounted/averaged infinite-horizon MDPs. In this paper, we study undiscounted off-policy policy evaluation for absorbing MDPs. Given the dataset consisting of the iid episodes with a given truncation level, we propose a so-called MWLA algorithm to directly estimate the expected return via the importance ratio of the state-action occupancy measure. The Mean Square Error (MSE) bound for the MWLA method is Cites: Breaking the curse of horizon: Infinite-horizon off-policy estimation
