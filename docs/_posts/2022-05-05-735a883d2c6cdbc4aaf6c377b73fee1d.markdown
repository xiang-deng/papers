Autoregressive neural networks have shown great success as part of sequence to sequence framework solving a diverse set of sequence generation tasks. These tasks include machine translation, dialogue modeling, question answering, text summarization, and sequence completion. In spite of the visible success, many challenges remain to be solved and are reported across these tasks. These challenges are usually discussed as visible deviations in the predicted sequence Cites: Distributionally Robust Multilingual Machine Translation
