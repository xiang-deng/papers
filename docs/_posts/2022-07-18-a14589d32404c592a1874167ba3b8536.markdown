Natural language processing (NLP) provides a framework for large-scale text analysis. One common processing method uses vector space models (VSMs) which embed word attributes, called features, into highly dimensional vectors. Comprehensive VSMs are generated on sources such as the GoogleNews archive. A thesaurus, a collection of semantically-related words, can be created for a particular root word using cosine similarity with a given VSM. Many methods have Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
