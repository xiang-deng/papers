Due to the ambiguous expressions and the subjectiveness of annotators, annotation ambiguity is a serious obstacle for facial expression recognition (FER). Ambiguous annotation exists in similar and dissimilar classes, which we call ambiguity and noise. The previous state-of-the-art approaches use uncertainty to generalize the two categories, and adopt uncertainty learning to suppress uncertainty samples. However, ambiguous expressions are confused with noisy label expressions may Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
