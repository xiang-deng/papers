Intense, large-scale forest fires are damaging and very challenging to control. Locations, where various types of fire behavior occur, vary depending on environmental factors. According to the burning site of forest fires and the degree of damage, this paper considers the classification and identification of surface fires and canopy fires. Deep learning-based forest fire detection uses convolutional neural networks to automatically extract multidimensional features of forest fire images with …
