In this paper, we introduce HugNLP, a unified and comprehensive library for natural language processing (NLP) with the prevalent backend of HuggingFace Transformers, which is designed for NLP researchers to easily utilize off-the-shelf algorithms and develop novel methods with user-defined models and tasks in real-world scenarios. HugNLP consists of a hierarchical structure including models, processors and applications that unifies the learning process of pre-trained language Cites: Unifying question answering and text classification via span
