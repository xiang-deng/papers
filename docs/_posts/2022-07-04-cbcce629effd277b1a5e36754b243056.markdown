We explore the concept of Casual Poetry Creators with the aim of making poetry writing fun and entertaining for the user. We present a simple co-creative interaction design pattern based on constructing poems line by line, suggesting the user a set of line candidates at each step. We also propose objective measures by which a Casual Poetry Creator can evaluate and choose which line candidates to show to the user and sketch out a plan to evaluate the measures and pattern with users.
