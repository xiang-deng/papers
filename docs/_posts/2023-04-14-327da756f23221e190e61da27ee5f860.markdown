In situations such as habitat construction, station inspection, or cooperative exploration, incorrect assumptions about the environment or task across the team could lead to mission failure. Thus it is important to resolve any ambiguity about the mission between teammates before embarking on a commanded task. The safeguards guaranteed by formal methods can be used to synthesize correct-by-construction reactive controllers for a robot using Linear Temporal Logic.
