Improving the teaching of viewing, listening, and speaking courses is the key to produce better workers for society. Improving teaching quality is therefore a key teaching objective. One way to improve the quality of English instruction is to conduct a scientific evaluation of videos, audios, and spoken language instructions. This paper investigates the neural network model and the evaluation of teaching effect in depth in order to solve the complex nonlinear problem of evaluating the impact of Cites: Improved semantic representations from tree-structured long short
