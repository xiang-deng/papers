This work aims to explore and evaluate a method of generalizing the sub-systems currently used in composite autonomous debating systems. Specifically, it aims to evaluate the feasibility of tackling the task of open domain stance classification with large, language representation models in order to reduce our reliance on domain-specific corpora and training. To this end, novel variants of the BERT architecture inspired by Target Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (TABSA) techniques are Cites: Seeing things from a different angle: Discovering diverse
