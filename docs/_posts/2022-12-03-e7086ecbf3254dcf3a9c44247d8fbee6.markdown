Crowdsourcing platforms collect massive dirty claims that are provided by sources for crowdsourced objects, which prompts truth inference to be proposed for crowdsourcing data denoising. Although current graph-based truth-inference methods achieve remarkable success by capturing complex crowdsourcing relationships, they typically suffer from two challenges: 1) They fail to obtain complete crowdsourcing relationships because of the structural limitations of crowdsourcing  Cites: Data integration with dependent sources
