The study presented in this work was devoted to understanding the effect of noises in classifiers created to model signals, a particular case of data analysis characterized for presenting temporal dependencies. In this sense, we have considered a real-world application related to predicting seismic volcano events based on its temporal monitoring. Firstly, we created a convolutional neural network (CNN) to model and predict such signals. Then, we have used statistical tests to confirm the noise  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
