Brassinosteroids (BRs) are important plant growth regulators affecting the growth and development of plants. Brassinosteroids are perceived by Brassinosteroid insensitive1 (BRI1) at the cell surface and a plethora of events occurs through brassinosteroid signalling, leading to changes in growth and developmental processes. In this study, a whole-genome investigation of the BRI1 gene family was carried out in wheat, Triticum aestivum, by using the currently available wheat … Cites: ‪BRL1 and BRL3 are novel brassinosteroid receptors that function …‬
