Sensing the fluid flow around an arbitrary geometry entails extrapolating from the physical quantities perceived at its surface in order to reconstruct the features of the surrounding fluid. This is a challenging inverse problem, yet one that if solved could have a significant impact on many engineering applications. The exploitation of such an inverse logic has gained interest in recent years with the advent of widely available cheap but capable MEMS-based sensors. When combined with novel data …
