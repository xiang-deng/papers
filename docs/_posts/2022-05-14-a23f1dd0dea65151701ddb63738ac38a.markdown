We present EASE, a novel method for learning sentence embeddings via contrastive learning between sentences and their related entities. The advantage of using entity supervision is twofold:(1) entities have been shown to be a strong indicator of text semantics and thus should provide rich training signals for sentence embeddings;(2) entities are defined independently of languages and thus offer useful cross-lingual alignment supervision. We evaluate EASE against other unsupervised models both Cites: XTREME: A massively multilingual multi-task benchmark for
