Several models have been proposed for hierarchical network embedding, however, it is difficult to optimize them. In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of hierarchical network embedding, we propose Hierarchical Complex Network Embedding (HCNE), which embeds hierarchical networks in complex space. The motivation that we utiliz the Euler formula of complex numbers for hierarchical network embedding is this can make the gradient descent algorithm easily work for  Cites: Fully Hyperbolic Neural Networks
