We propose Depth-to-Space Net (DTS-Net), an effective technique for semantic segmentation using the efficient sub-pixel convolutional neural network. This technique is inspired by depth-to-space (DTS) image reconstruction, which was originally used for image and video super-resolution tasks, combined with a mask enhancement filtration technique based on multi-label classification, namely, Nearest Label Filtration. In the proposed technique, we employ depth-wise separable Cites: DiCENet: Dimension-wise convolutions for efficient networks
