Recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture is popular among researchers due to many of the advantages, among which most important are processing sequences of different lengths, handling vanishing gradient, and capability to capture temporal and spatial features in its hidden state within a sequence of inputs. RNNs have simple and hybrid architectures with a number of input-output combinations. In this chapter, the versatility of RNN is depicted through two case studies.
