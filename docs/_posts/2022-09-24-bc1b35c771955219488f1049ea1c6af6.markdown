We propose a new data augmentation technique for semi-supervised learning settings that emphasizes learning from the most challenging regions of the feature space. Starting with a fully supervised reference model, we first identify low confidence predictions. These samples are then used to train a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) that can generate an infinite number of additional images with similar distribution. Finally, using the originally labeled data and the synthetically Cites: A framework for contrastive self-supervised learning and designing
