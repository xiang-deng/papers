Integrated with the state-of-the-art technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been successfully applied to diverse industries thanks to the increased availability of data and computing power. As AI applications become more challenging to solve real world problems, various explainable AI techniques have also been developed to interpret AI models. In this paper, we conduct SHAP value analysis, which is one of the explainable AI, to assess the feature importance of the load forecasting model  Cites: " Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any
