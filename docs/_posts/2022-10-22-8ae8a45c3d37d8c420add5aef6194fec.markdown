Distant supervision (DS) can automatically generate annotated data for relation extraction (RE) with knowledge bases and corpora. The existing DS methods that train on bags selected by attention mechanism are susceptible to noisy bags and neglect useful information in noisy bags. In this paper, we propose DCSR, a novel DS method which utilizes deep clustering to obtain refined superbag representations for solving the wrong labeling problem. we substitute deep clustering for selective Cites: Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text
