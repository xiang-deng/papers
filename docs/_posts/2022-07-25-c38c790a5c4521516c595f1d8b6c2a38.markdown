Open information extraction (OIE) methods extract plenty of OIE triples< noun phrase, relation phrase, noun phrase> from unstructured text, which compose large open knowledge bases (OKBs). Noun phrases and relation phrases in such OKBs are not canonicalized, which leads to scattered and redundant facts. It is found that two views of knowledge (ie, a fact view based on the fact triple and a context view based on the fact triple s source context) provide complementary information that is vital to  Cites: Towards practical open knowledge base canonicalization
