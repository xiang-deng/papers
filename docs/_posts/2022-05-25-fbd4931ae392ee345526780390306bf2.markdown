Sepsis is associated with high mortality—particularly in low–middle income countries (LMICs). Critical care management of sepsis is challenging in LMICs due to the lack of care providers and the high cost of bedside monitors. Recent advances in wearable sensor technology and machine learning (ML) models in healthcare promise to deliver new ways of digital monitoring integrated with automated decision systems to reduce the mortality risk in sepsis. In this study, firstly, we aim to assess … Cites: ‪  Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any …‬
