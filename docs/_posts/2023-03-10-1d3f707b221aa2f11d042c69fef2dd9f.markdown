Variational autoencoder (VAE) is widely used in tasks of unsupervised text generation due to its potential of deriving meaningful latent spaces, which, however, often assumes that the distribution of texts follows a common yet poor-expressed isotropic Gaussian. In real-life scenarios, sentences with different semantics may not follow simple isotropic Gaussian. Instead, they are very likely to follow a more intricate and diverse distribution due to the inconformity of different topics in texts  Cites: Reading tea leaves: How humans interpret topic models
