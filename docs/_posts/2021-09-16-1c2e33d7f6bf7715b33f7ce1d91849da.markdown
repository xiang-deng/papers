Solving the problem of understanding and creating mathematics using natural mathematical languagethe mixture of symbolic and natural language used by humansis a path towards developing agents capable of reasoning. The mixture of symbolic and natural text in informal mathematics, along with the existence of a formal counterpart, offers a unique setting for studying reasoning that complements research involving natural language alone or purely within a formal system Cites: Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering
