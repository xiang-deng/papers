Rapid progress in machine learning for natural language processing has the potential to transform debates about how humans learn language. However, the learning environments and biases of current artificial learners and humans diverge in ways that weaken the impact of the evidence obtained from learning simulations. For example, today s most effective neural language models are trained on roughly one thousand times the amount of linguistic data available to a typical child.
