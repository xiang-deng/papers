Graph-based embedding has attracted much attention in the fields of machine learning and pattern recognition. It is becoming an indispensable tool for data representation. It can be useful for all types of learning: unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised. In this correspondence, we present a graph-based, deep and flexible method for data representation with feature propagation. The presented framework ensures several desired features such as graph-based  Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
