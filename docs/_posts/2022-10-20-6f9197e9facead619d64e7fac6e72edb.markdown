Relational tables are widely used to store information about entities and their attributes and they are the de-facto format for training AI algorithms. Numerous Semantic Table Interpretation approaches have been proposed in particular for the so-called cell-entity annotation task aiming at disambiguating the values of table cells given reference knowledge graphs (KGs). Among these methods, heuristic-based ones have demonstrated to be the ones reaching the best performance, often …
