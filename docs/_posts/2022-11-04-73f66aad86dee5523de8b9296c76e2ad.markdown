With the booming development of deep learning and machine learning, the use of neural networks for software source code security vulnerability detection has become a hot pot in the field of software security. As a data structure, graphs can adequately represent the complex syntactic information, semantic information, and dependencies in software source code. In this paper, we propose the MPGVD model based on the idea of text classification in natural language processing. The model …
