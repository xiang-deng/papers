Active learning (AL) aims to sample the most valuable data for model improvement from the unlabeled pool. Traditional works, especially uncertainty-based methods, are prone to suffer from a data bias issue, which means that selected data cannot cover the entire unlabeled pool well. Although there have been lots of literature works focusing on this issue recently, they mainly benefit from the huge additional training costs and the artificially designed complex loss. The latter causes these …
