Slope disasters, such as landslides and rockfalls, can cause significant safety issues for land and road use in many countries. Therefore, it is important to have effective monitoring and early warning systems in place. Although using images or closed‐circuit televisions have some limitations, using seismic data for monitoring can provide real‐time information, are useful at night, and are less affected by weather conditions. However, a lack of seismic recordings for different types of slope …
