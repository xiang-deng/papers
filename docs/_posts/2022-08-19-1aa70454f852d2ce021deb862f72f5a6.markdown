Learning invariant (causal) features for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has attracted extensive attention recently, and among the proposals invariant risk minimization (IRM)(Arjovsky et al., 2019) is a notable solution. In spite of its theoretical promise for linear regression, the challenges of using IRM in linear classification problems yet remain (Rosenfeld et al., 2020, Nagarajan et al., 2021). Along this line, a recent study (Arjovsky et al., 2019) has made a first step and Cites: Annotation artifacts in natural language inference data
