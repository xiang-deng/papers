Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved notable performances in many fields and its research impact in healthcare has been unquestionable. Nevertheless, the deployment of such computational models in clinical practice is still limited. Some of the major issues recognized as barriers to a successful real-world machine learning applications include lack of: transparency; reliability and personalization. Actually, these aspects are decisive not only for patient safety, but also to assure the Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
