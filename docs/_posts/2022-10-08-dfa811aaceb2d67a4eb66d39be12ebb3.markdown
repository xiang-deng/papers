The success of modern machine learning algorithms depends crucially on efficient data representation and compression through dimensionality reduction. This practice seemingly contradicts the conventional intuition suggesting that data processing always leads to information loss. We prove that this intuition is wrong. For any non-convex problem, there exists an optimal, benign auto-encoder (BAE) extracting a lower-dimensional data representation that is strictly beneficial: Compressing model …
