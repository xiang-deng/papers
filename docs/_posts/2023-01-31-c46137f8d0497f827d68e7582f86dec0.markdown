Reinforcement learning (RL) is mechanized to learn from experience. It solves the problem in sequential decisions by optimizing reward-punishment through experimentation of the distinct actions in an environment. Unlike supervised learning models, RL lacks static input-output mappings and the objective of minimization of a vector error. However, to find out an optimal strategy, it is crucial to learn both continuous feedback from training data and the offline rules of the experiences with  Cites: Opponent modeling in deep reinforcement learning
