Change detection in urban areas can be helpful for urban resource management and smart city planning. The effects of human activities on the environment and ground have gained momentum over the past decades, causing remote sensing data sources analysis (such as satellite images) to become an option for swift change detection in the environment and urban areas. We proposed a semi-transfer learning method of EfficientNetV2 T-Unet (EffV2 T-Unet) that combines the effectiveness of Cites: Efficientnetv2: Smaller models and faster training
