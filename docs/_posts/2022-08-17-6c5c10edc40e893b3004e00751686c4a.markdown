In interactive multiobjective optimization methods, the preferences of a decision maker are incorporated in a solution process to find solutions of interest for problems with multiple conflicting objectives. Since multiple solutions exist for these problems with various trade-offs, preferences are crucial to identify the best solution (s). However, it is not necessarily clear to the decision maker how the preferences lead to particular solutions and, by introducing explanations to interactive multiobjective Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
