With the widespread use of deep-learning models in production environments, the value of deep-learning models has become more prominent. The key issues are the rights of the model trainers and the security of the specific scenarios using the models. In the commercial domain, consumers pay different fees and have access to different levels of services. Therefore, dividing the model into several shadow models with multiple weights is necessary. When holders want to use the model, they can …
