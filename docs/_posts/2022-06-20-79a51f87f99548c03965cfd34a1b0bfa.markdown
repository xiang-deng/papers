When used for small-scale datasets classification tasks, deep neural networks are difficult to train, which results in the network not extracting useful features and the low accuracy of network. This paper proposes a method called Enhanced Adversarial Autoencoders (EAAE) to improve the accuracy of classification in small-scale datasets scenarios. We reuse the decoder of the Adversarial Autoencoders to generate data for the specified category, which expands the training space of the  Cites: Fine-grained attention mechanism for neural machine translation
