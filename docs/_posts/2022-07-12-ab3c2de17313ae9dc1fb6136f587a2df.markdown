Dense retrieval approaches are of increasing interest because they can better capture contextualised similarity compared to sparse retrieval models such as BM25. Among the most prominent of these approaches is TCT-ColBERT, which trains a light-weight  student  model from a more expensive  teacher  model. In this work, we take a closer look into TCT-ColBERT concerning its reproducibility and replicability. To structure our study, we propose a three-stage perspective on reproducing the …
