In text summarization and simplification, system outputs must be evaluated along multiple dimensions such as relevance, factual consistency, fluency, and grammaticality, and a wide range of possible outputs could be of high quality. These properties make the development of an adaptable, reference-less evaluation metric both necessary and challenging. We introduce MaskEval, a reference-less metric for text summarization and simplification that operates by performing masked language  Cites: BARTScore: Evaluating Generated Text as Text Generation
