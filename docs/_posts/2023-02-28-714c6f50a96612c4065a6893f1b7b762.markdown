To alleviate the problem of under-utilization features of sentence-level relation extraction, which leads to insufficient performance of the pre-trained language model and underutilization of the feature vector, a sentence-level relation extraction method based on adding prompt information and feature reuse is proposed. At first, in addition to the pair of nominals and sentence information, a piece of prompt information is added, and the overall feature information consists of sentence …
