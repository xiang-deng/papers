Recently many mutation testing tools have been proposed that rely on bug-fix patterns and natural language models trained on large code corpus. As these tools operate fundamentally differently from the grammar-based traditional approaches, a question arises of how these tools compare in terms of 1) fault detection and 2) cost-effectiveness. Simultaneously, mutation testing research proposes mutant selection approaches based on machine learning to mitigate its application cost. This raises …
