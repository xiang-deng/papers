Controlling neural network-based models for natural language generation (NLG) to realize desirable attributes in the generated outputs has broad applications in numerous areas such as machine translation, document summarization, and dialog systems. Approaches that enable such control in a zero-shot manner would be of great importance as, among other reasons, they remove the need for additional annotated data and training. In this work, we propose novel approaches for Cites: A controllable model of grounded response generation
