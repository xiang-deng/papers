Attribution-based explanations are popular in computer vision but of limited use for fine-grained classification problems typical of expert domains, where classes differ by subtle details. In these domains, users also seek understanding of why a class was chosen and why not an alternative class. A new GenerAlized expLanatiOn fRamEwork (GALORE) is proposed to satisfy all these requirements, by unifying attributive explanations with explanations of two other types. The first is a new class Cites: Contrastive explanations for model interpretability
