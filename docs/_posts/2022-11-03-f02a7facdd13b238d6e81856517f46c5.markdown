Semantic representation is a way of expressing the meaning of a text that can be processed by a machine to serve a particular natural language processing (NLP) task that usually requires meaning comprehension such as text summarisation, question answering or machine translation. In this paper, we present a semantic parsing model based on neural networks to obtain semantic representation of a given sentence. We utilise semantic representation of each sentence to generate Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
