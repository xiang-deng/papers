For developing a math word problem (MWP) solver, the problem text is usually modeled as a word sequence to put into a recursive neural network to capture the quantity relationships presented by the text. Recently, more and more researchers leverage graph-based models for problem representation learning and significant improvements are claimed to have achieved. To explore the potential effectiveness of presentation learning methods on diverse characteristics of benchmark datasets, a Cites: MAWPS: A math word problem repository
