In this paper we introduce a freely available treebank that includes argument structure construction (ASC) annotation. We then use the treebank to train probabilistic annotation models that rely on verb lemmas and/or syntactic frames. We also use the treebank data to train a highly accurate transformer-based annotation model (F1= 91.8%). Future directions for the development of the treebank and annotation models are discussed.
