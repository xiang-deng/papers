Graph contrastive learning has become a powerful technique for several graph mining tasks. It learns discriminative representation from different perspectives of augmented graphs. Ubiquitous in our daily life, singed-directed graphs are the most complex and tricky to analyze among various graph types. That is why singed-directed graph contrastive learning has not been studied much yet, while there are many contrastive studies for unsigned and undirected. Thus, this paper proposes a …
