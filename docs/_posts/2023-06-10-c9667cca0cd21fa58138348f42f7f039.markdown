The pre-trained language model has been developed for evaluating the quality of machine translation. It achieves state-of-the-art results. However, building a model for the evaluation of machine translation still faces the following challenges: 1) large scale of the training data affects the speed of the optimization; 2) the varied quality of the training data makes the optimization process unstable. To alleviate the issues of data learning, curriculum learning is proposed to rearrange the training sequence …
