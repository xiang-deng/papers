Abstract Knowledge base question answering (KBQA) refers to combining the information in the knowledge base to obtain an answer for an objective question. However, most of the existing methods tend to add a large number of hand-crafted features or constraints to improve the performance of the model. This makes the KBQA system more and more complex, but the improvement is limited. In this work, we try a novel method without any hand-crafted features or constraints, which Cites: Semantic parsing via staged query graph generation: Question
