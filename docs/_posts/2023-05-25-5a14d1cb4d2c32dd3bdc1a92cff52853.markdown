Nearest Neighbor Machine Translation ($ k $ NN-MT) has achieved great success on domain adaptation tasks by integrating pre-trained Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models with domain-specific token-level retrieval. However, the reasons underlying its success have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of $ k $ NN-MT through theoretical and empirical studies. Initially, we offer a theoretical interpretation of the working mechanism of $ k …
