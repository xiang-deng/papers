We study the problem of learning good heuristic functions for classical planning tasks with neural networks based on samples that are states with their cost-to-goal estimates. It is well known that the learned model quality depends on the training data quality. Our main goal is to understand better the influence of sample generation strategies on the performance of a greedy best-first heuristic search guided by a learned heuristic function. In a set of controlled experiments, we find that Cites: Neural logic machines
