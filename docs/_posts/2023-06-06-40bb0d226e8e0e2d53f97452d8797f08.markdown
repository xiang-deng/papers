Contrastive learning methods have been applied to a range of domains and modalities by training models to identify similar views of data points. However, specialized scientific modalities pose a challenge for this paradigm, as identifying good views for each scientific instrument is complex and time-intensive. In this paper, we focus on applying contrastive learning approaches to a variety of remote sensing datasets. We show that Viewmaker networks, a recently proposed method for Cites: Electra: Pre-training text encoders as discriminators rather than
