Personalized recommender systems have been extensively studied in human-centered intelligent systems. Existing recommendation techniques have achieved comparable performance in predictive accuracy; however, the trade-off between recommendation accuracy and diversity poses new challenges, as diversification may lead to accuracy loss, whereas it can solve the over-fitting problem and enhance the user experience. In this study, we propose a heuristic optimization-based  Cites: Pareto-efficient hybridization for multi-objective recommender
