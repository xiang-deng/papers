We put forward an end-to-end multi-step machine learning model which jointly labels semantic roles and the proto-roles of Dowty (1991), given a sentence and the predicates therein. Our best architecture first learns argument spans followed by learning the argument s syntactic heads. This information is shared with the next steps for predicting the semantic roles and proto-roles. We also experiment with transfer learning from argument and head prediction to role and proto-role labeling Cites: Syntax-aware semantic role labeling without parsing
