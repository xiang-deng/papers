Rank Aggregation has ubiquitous applications in operations research, artificial intelligence, computational social choice, and various other fields. Interest in this problem has increased due in part to the need to consolidate lists of rankings and scores output by different decision-making processes and algorithms. Although most attention has focused on the variant of this problem induced by the Kemeny-Snell distance, other robust rank aggregation problems have been proposed.
