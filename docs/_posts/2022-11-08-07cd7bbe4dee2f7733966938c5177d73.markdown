Scene graph generation (SGG) methods extract relationships between objects. While most methods focus on improving top-down approaches, which build a scene graph based on detected objects from an off-the-shelf object detector, there is a limited amount of work on bottom-up approaches, which jointly detect objects and their relationships in a single stage. In this work, we present a novel bottom-up SGG approach by representing relationships using Composite Relationship Fields …
