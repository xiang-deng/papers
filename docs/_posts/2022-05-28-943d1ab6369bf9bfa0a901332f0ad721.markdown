Text steganography has received a lot of attention in the application of covert communication. How to ensure desirable capacity and imperceptibility has become a key issue in text steganography. There are two typical approaches, ie, text-selection-based steganography and text-generation-based steganography. However, the text-selection-based approaches generally have the very low hidden capacity and are not applicable in practical scenarios. Although the text-generation-based  Cites: Word n-gram attention models for sentence similarity and inference
