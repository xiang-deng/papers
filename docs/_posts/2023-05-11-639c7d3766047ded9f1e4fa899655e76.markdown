Language prompting induces the model to produce a textual output during the training phase, which achieves remarkable performance in few-shot learning scenarios. However, current prompt-based methods either use the same task-specific prompts for each instance, losing the particularity of instance-dependent information, or generate an instance-dependent prompt for each instance, lacking shared information about the task. In this paper, we propose an efficient few-shot  Cites: Making Pre-trained Language Models Better Few-shot Learners
