As a kind of relational data structure, graph (or network) attract much research attention for dealing with this unprecedented phenomenon. To be specific, many graph-based algorithms and tools are proposed, such as DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014), LINE (Tang et al., 2015), node2vec (Grover and Leskovec, 2016), GCN (Kipf and Welling, 2017), GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), GAT …
