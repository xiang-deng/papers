The current wireless communication infrastructure has to face exponential development in mobile traffic size, which demands high data rate, reliability, and low latency. MIMO systems and their variants (ie, Multi-User MIMO and Massive MIMO) are the most promising 5G wireless communication systems technology due to their high system throughput and data rate. However, the most significant challenges in MIMO communication are substantial problems in exploiting the multiple-antenna Cites: From language to programs: Bridging reinforcement learning and
