This paper presents a new framework for the seismic loss prediction of residential buildings in tautahi/Christchurch, New Zealand. It employs data science techniques, geospatial tools, and machine learning (ML) trained on insurance claims data from the Earthquake Commission (EQC) collected following the 20102011 Canterbury earthquake sequence (CES). The seismic loss prediction obtained from the ML model is shown to outperform the output from existing risk analysis tools for  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
