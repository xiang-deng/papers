In this paper, we intent to find robust and efficient models for affective sentiment classification tasks. Therefore, we apply both traditional machine learning algorithms, such as XGBoosted Forest, and deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Network. We explore rich feature sets such as syntatic features, emotional features, and survey features, which collected from different resources, to find the essential features for the tasks. Next, we propose to train these model to get Cites: Feature-rich part-of-speech tagging with a cyclic dependency
