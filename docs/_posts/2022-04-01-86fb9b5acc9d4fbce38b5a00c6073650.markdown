In this paper, we present ManyTypes4TypeScript, a very large corpus for training and evaluating machine-learning models for sequence-based type inference in TypeScript. The dataset includes over 9 million type annotations, across 13,953 projects and 539,571 files. The dataset is approximately 10x larger than analogous type inference datasets for Python, and is the largest available for Type-Script. We also provide API access to the dataset, which can be integrated into any tokenizer Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
