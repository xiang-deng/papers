The vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) as one of the most known combinatorial operations (CO) problem is considered to be a tough issue in practice and the main challenge of that is to find the approximate solutions within a reasonable time. In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) based methods have gained increasing attention in many CO problems, such as the vehicle routing problems (VRP), due to their enormous potential to efficiently generate high-quality Cites: Effective approaches to attention-based neural machine translation
