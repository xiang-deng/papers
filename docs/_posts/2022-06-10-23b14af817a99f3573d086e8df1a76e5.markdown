The usage of deep learning (DL) approaches for software engineering has attracted much attention, particularly in source code modelling and analysis. However, in order to use DL, source code needs to be formatted to fit the expected input form of DL models. This problem is known as source code representation. Source code can be represented via different approaches, most importantly, the tree‐based, token‐based, and graph‐based approaches. We use a systematic mapping study to …
