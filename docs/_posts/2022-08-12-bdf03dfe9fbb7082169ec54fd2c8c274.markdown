Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC), as a subclass classification task under the superclass, brings more challenges. However, in addition to fine-grained features, the FungiCLEF 2022 dataset is also characterized by imbalance and rich meta-information. This motivates us to explore the impact of different methods and components in fine-grained classification on FungiCLEF 2022. We explore the impact of different data augmentations, backbones, loss functions, and attention Cites: Randaugment: Practical automated data augmentation with a
