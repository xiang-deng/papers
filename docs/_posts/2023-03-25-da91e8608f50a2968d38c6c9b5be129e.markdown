Existing knowledge graph representation learning (KGRL) models rely on explicit semantic information of triple structure and cannot fully mine the implicit semantic information in the knowledge graph (KG). Aiming to improve KGRL model performance and accuracy, making up for the disadvantages of existing research, we propose Melo (Meta-information and Logical rules), a novel KGRL model that leverages meta-information and logical rules of entities and relations.
