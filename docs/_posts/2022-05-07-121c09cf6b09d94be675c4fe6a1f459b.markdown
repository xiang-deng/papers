Traditionally, studies on technical communication (TC) are based on stochastic modeling and manipulation. This is not sufficient for semantic communication (SC) where semantic elements are logically connected, rather than stochastically correlated. To fill this void, by leveraging a logical programming language called probabilistic logic (ProbLog), we propose a unified approach to semantic information and communication through the interplay between TC and SC.
