Although state-of-the-art deep neural network models are known to be robust to random perturbations, it was verified that these architectures are indeed quite vulnerable to deliberately crafted perturbations, albeit being quasi-imperceptible. These vulnerabilities make it challenging to deploy deep neural network models in the areas where security is a critical concern. In recent years, many research studies have been conducted to develop new attack methods and come up with new Cites: Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate
