Counting the solutions to Boolean formulae defines the problem# SAT, which is complete for the complexity class# P. We use the ZH-calculus, a universal and complete graphical language for linear maps which naturally encodes counting problems in terms of diagrams, to give graphical reductions from# SAT to several related counting problems. Some of these graphical reductions, like to# 2SAT, are substantially simpler than known reductions via the matrix permanent. Additionally  Cites: On the hardness of approximate reasoning
