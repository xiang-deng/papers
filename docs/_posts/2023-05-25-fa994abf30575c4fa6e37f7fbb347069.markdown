Diffusion models have emerged as the new state-of-the-art family of deep generative models, and their promising potentials for text generation have recently attracted increasing attention. Existing studies mostly adopt a single encoder architecture with partially noising processes for conditional text generation, but its degree of flexibility for conditional modeling is limited. In fact, the encoder-decoder architecture is naturally more flexible for its detachable encoder and decoder modules, which is  Cites: Diffuser: Discrete diffusion via edit-based reconstruction
