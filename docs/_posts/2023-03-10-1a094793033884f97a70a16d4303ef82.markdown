Denoising Diffusion models have demonstrated their proficiency for generative sampling. However, generating good samples often requires many iterations. Consequently, techniques such as binary time-distillation (BTD) have been proposed to reduce the number of network calls for a fixed architecture. In this paper, we introduce TRAnsitive Closure Time-distillation (TRACT), a new method that extends BTD. For single step diffusion, TRACT improves FID by up to 2.4 x on the same …
