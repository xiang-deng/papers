In symbolic regression with formal constraints, the conventional formulation of regression problem is extended with desired properties of the target model, like symmetry, monotonicity, or convexity. We present a genetic programming algorithm that solves such problems using a Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver to formally verify the candidate solutions. The essence of the method consists in collecting the counterexamples resulting from model verification and using them to improve search Cites: Learning Hebrew roots: Machine learning with linguistic constraints
