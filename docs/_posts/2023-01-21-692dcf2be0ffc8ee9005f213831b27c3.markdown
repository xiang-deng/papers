The relationship between electricity demand and weather has been established for a long time and is one of the cornerstones in load prediction for operation and planning, along with behavioral and social aspects such as calendars or significant events. This paper explores how and why the social information contained in the news can be used better to understand aggregate population behaviour in terms of energy demand. The work is done through experiments analysing the impact of  Cites: Effective LSTMs for target-dependent sentiment classification
