Building a knowledge graph is a time-consuming and costly process which often applies complex natural language processing (NLP) methods for extracting knowledge graph triples from text corpora. Pre-trained large Language Models (PLM) have emerged as a crucial type of approach that provides readily available knowledge for a range of AI applications. However, it is unclear whether it is feasible to construct domain-specific knowledge graphs from PLMs. Motivated by the capacity Cites: An Empirical Study on Few-shot Knowledge Probing for Pretrained
