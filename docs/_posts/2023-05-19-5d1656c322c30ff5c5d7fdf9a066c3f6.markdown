How can we use large language models (LLMs) to augment surveys? This paper investigates three distinct applications of LLMs fine-tuned by nationally representative surveys for opinion prediction--missing data imputation, retrodiction, and zero-shot prediction. We present a new methodological framework that incorporates neural embeddings of survey questions, individual beliefs, and temporal contexts to personalize LLMs in opinion prediction. Among 3,110 binarized Cites: Whose opinions do language models reflect?
