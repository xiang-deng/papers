Limited by the incomprehensive training samples, existing scene graph generation (SGG) methods perform poorly on predicting zero-shot (ie, unseen) subject-predicate-object triples. To address this problem, we propose a general SGG framework to improve their zero-shot performance. The main idea of our method is to generate the information of zero-shot triples before the training of the predicate classifier and thus make the original zero-shot triples non-zero-shot. Specifically, the missing Cites: GQA: A new dataset for real-world visual reasoning and
