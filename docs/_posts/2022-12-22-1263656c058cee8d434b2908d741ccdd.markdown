Understanding causality has the potential to improve robustness, fairness, and interpretability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. In this work, we focus on the task of modelbased causal reasoning (CR) and conceptual explanation generation (EG) for causal facts. We train and evaluate numerous baseline large language models for both tasks using the recently developed human-annotated explainable CAusal REasoning (e-CARE) dataset. We also find that multitask Cites: Joint reasoning for temporal and causal relations
