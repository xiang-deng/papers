Extracting arguments for the pre-defined roles is a crucial step for event extraction. Recently, there are some insightful works that view it as a machine reading comprehension problem and achieve significant progress. However, most of them need multi-turns to extract the arguments of each role independently, which ignores the relationships among roles in the same event. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Multi-Role Argument Extraction method named MRAE which can Cites: Entity, relation, and event extraction with contextualized span
