Transfer learning is a technique utilized in deep learning applications to transmit learned inference to a different target domain. The approach is mainly to solve the problem of a few training datasets resulting in model overfitting, which affects model performance. The study was carried out on publications retrieved from various digital libraries such as SCOPUS, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar, which formed the Primary studies. Secondary studies were retrieved Cites: Electra: Pre-training text encoders as discriminators rather than
