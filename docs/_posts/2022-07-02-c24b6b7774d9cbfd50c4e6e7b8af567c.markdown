While a lot of work has been done in understanding representations learned within deep NLP models and what knowledge they capture, little attention has been paid towards individual neurons. We present a technique called as Linguistic Correlation Analysis to extract salient neurons in the model, with respect to any extrinsic property-with the goal of understanding how such a knowledge is preserved within neurons. We carry out a fine-grained analysis to answer the following questions:(i) can we
