Recent advances in deep learning have been driven by large-scale parametric models, which can be computationally expensive and lack interpretability. Semi-parametric methods query the training set at inference time and can be more compact, although they typically have quadratic computational complexity. Here, we introduce SPIN, a general-purpose semi-parametric neural architecture whose computational cost is linear in the size and dimensionality of the data.
