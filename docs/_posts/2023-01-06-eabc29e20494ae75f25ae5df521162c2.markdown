This paper introduces the Forgotten Realms Wiki (FRW) data set and uses it for domain specific natural language generation. The data set was extracted from Wikipedia-esque website Forgotten Realms Fandom wiki, dedicated to the tabletop role playing game Dungeons and Dragons (D&D). The FRW data set is constituted of 11 sub-data sets in varying formats intended for different NLP tasks including text generation and semantic similarity comparison. This is the first data set of this size for Cites: Collective content selection for concept-to-text generation
