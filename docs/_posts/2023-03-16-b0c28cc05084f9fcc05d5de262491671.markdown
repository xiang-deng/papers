Outlier detection is critical in real applications to prevent financial fraud, defend network intrusions, or detecting imminent device failures. To reduce the human effort in evaluating outlier detection results and effectively turn the outliers into actionable insights, the users often expect a system to automatically produce interpretable summarizations of subgroups of outlier detection results. Unfortunately, to date no such systems exist. To fill this gap, we propose STAIR which learns a compact set of …
