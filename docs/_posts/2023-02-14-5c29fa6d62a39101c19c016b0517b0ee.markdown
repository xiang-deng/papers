Graph-based deep learning has been successful in various industrial settings and applications. However, deep models can hardly achieve generalization, because graphs from different domains may exhibit different properties, and may have significant noise. These challenges limit the usage of graph models in various areas. In this thesis, I present a variety of theoretical and empirical analyses towards generalizable neural networks (NNs) for graphs. I consider two types of …
