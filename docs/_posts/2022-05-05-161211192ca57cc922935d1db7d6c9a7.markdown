This thesis presents a novel approach to interlingual machine translation using - calculus expressions as an intermediate representation. It investigates and extends existing algo-rithms which learn a combinatorial category grammar for semantic parsing, and introduces two new algorithms for generation out of logical forms inspired by that semantic parser. The results of a set of new experiments for generation and parsing are described, as well as an evaluation of the performance of Cites: Learning dependency-based compositional semantics
