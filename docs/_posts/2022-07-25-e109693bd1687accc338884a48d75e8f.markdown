Semantic segmentation has gained research attention in recent times, especially within the remote sensing community. The deep neural network has proven to be the most effective approach for segmentation applications due to its automatic feature extraction capability. Research results indicate that the multiscale segmentation frameworks are more suitable for high-level feature extraction, especially from complex remote sensing images. However, most existing multiscale frameworks are Cites: ESPNetv2: A Light-weight, Power Efficient, and General Purpose
