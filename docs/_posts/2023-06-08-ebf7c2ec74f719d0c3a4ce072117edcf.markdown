Employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to address mathematical problems is an intriguing research endeavor, considering the abundance of math problems expressed in natural language across numerous science and engineering fields. While several prior works have investigated solving elementary mathematics using LLMs, this work explores the frontier of using GPT-4 for solving more complex and challenging math problems. We evaluate various ways of using GPT-4. Some of …
