Determining proper quantities for ingredients is an essential part of cooking practice from the perspective of enriching tastiness and promoting healthiness. We introduce KitchenScale, a fine-tuned Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) that predicts a target ingredient s quantity and measurement unit given its recipe context. To effectively train our KitchenScale model, we formulate an ingredient quantity prediction task that consists of three sub-tasks which are ingredient measurement type classification, unit Cites: Do NLP Models Know Numbers?
