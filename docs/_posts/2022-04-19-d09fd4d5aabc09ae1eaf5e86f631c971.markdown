This study investigates the connection between lexical items  distributions and their meanings from the perspective of computational distributional operations. When applying computational methods in meaning-related research, it is customary to refer to the so-called distributional hypothesis, according to which differences in distributions and meanings are mutually correlated. However, making use of such a hypothesis requires critical explication of the concept of distribution and plausible Cites: Similarity-driven semantic role induction via graph partitioning
