Reasoning and question answering as a basic cognitive function for humans, is nevertheless a great challenge for current artificial intelligence. Although the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) model could solve such problems to a certain extent, the development is still limited by its high algorithm complexity, slow convergence speed, and poor test robustness. Inspired by the learning and memory mechanism of the brain, this paper proposed a Memory Transformation based  Cites: Query-reduction networks for question answering
