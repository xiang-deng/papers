Building a model to represent the semantic of a sentence is crucial for going beyond a sequence of words to a more abstract yet relevant representation. The relevance of such models is ubiquitous in various natural language processing tasks. Following this context, we capitalise on deep learning for proposing a new model-based attention mechanism. Our contribution aims at embedding the sentence meaning in an unsupervised iterative way. The word and the sentence embeddings therefore  Cites: Learning distributed representations of sentences from unlabelled
