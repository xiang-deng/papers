Commonsense question answering (QA) research requires machines to answer questions based on commonsense knowledge. However, this research requires expensive labor costs to annotate data as the basis of research, and models that rely on fine-tuning paradigms only apply to specific tasks, rather than learn a general commonsense reasoning ability. As a more robust method, zero-shot commonsense question answering shows a good prospect. The current zero-shot framework tries to Cites: CommonsenseQA: A Question Answering Challenge Targeting
