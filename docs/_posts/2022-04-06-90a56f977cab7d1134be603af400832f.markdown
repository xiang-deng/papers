Tensors are a popular algebraic structure for a wide range of applications, due to their exceptional capability to model multidimensional relationships of the data. Among them, regular tensors with aligned dimensions for all modes have been extensively studied, for which various tensor factorization structures are proposed depending on the applications. However, regular tensor decomposition is incapable of handling many real-world cases involving time, due to its irregularity.
