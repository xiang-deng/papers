There is a growing interest in pushing computation to the Edge, especially the problem-solving abilities of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This paper presents a simplified method to obtain a Ternary Neural Network based on the Multilayer Perceptron. The method is focused on resource-constrained devices, where memory, computing power, and battery are some of the most relevant constraints. A dynamic threshold is estimated to perform ternarization, and a new pruning technique is Cites: Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database
