Recent years have witnessed increased demand for users to be able to interpret the results of data science pipelines, locate erroneous data items in the input, evaluate the importance of individual input data items, and acknowledge the contributions of data curators.

To address this issue, my goal is to expedite the use of fine-grained provenance in applications within both the Cites: Understanding black-box predictions via influence functions
