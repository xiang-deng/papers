Many data analysis tasks heavily rely on a deep understanding of tables (multi-dimensional data). Across the tasks, there exist comonly used metadata attributes of table fields/columns. In this paper, we identify four such analysis metadata: Measure/dimension dichotomy, common field roles, semantic field type, and default aggregation function. While those metadata face challenges of insufficient supervision signals, utilizing existing knowledge and understanding distribution. To Cites: TABBIE: Pretrained Representations of Tabular Data
