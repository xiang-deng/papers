Entity Resolution (ER) links entities that refer to the same real-world entity from different sources. Existing work usually takes pairs of entities as input and judges those pairs independently. However, there is often interdependence between different pairs of ER decisions, eg, the entities from the same data source are usually semantically related to each other. Furthermore, current ER approaches are mainly based on attribute similarity comparison, but ignore interdependence between Cites: Entity linking via joint encoding of types, descriptions, and context
