Finding the optimal game strategy is a difficult problem in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm confrontation. As an effective solution to the sequential decision-making problem, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) provides a promising way to realize intelligent countermeasures. However, there are two challenges in applying MARL to large-scale UAV swarm confrontation: i) the curse of dimensionality caused by the excessive scale of UAV clusters and ii) the …
