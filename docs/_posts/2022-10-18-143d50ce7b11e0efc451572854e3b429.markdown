The ever-growing size of the foundation language model has brought significant performance gains in various types of downstream tasks. With the existence of side-effects brought about by the large size of the foundation language model such as deployment cost, availability issues, and environmental cost, there is some interest in exploring other possible directions, such as a divide-and-conquer scheme. In this paper, we are asking a basic question: are language processes naturally dividable  Cites: Glam: Efficient scaling of language models with mixture-of-experts
