Neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved remarkable progress in the past several years; however, little attention has been paid to MT between Japanese and Chinese who share a large proportion of cognate words that can be utilized as additional linguistic knowledge to enhance translation performance. In this article, we seek to strengthen the semantic correlation between Japanese and Chinese by leveraging cognate words that share common Chinese characters. Specifically, we Cites: Neural machine translation with byte-level subwords
