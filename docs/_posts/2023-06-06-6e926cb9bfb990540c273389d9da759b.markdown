Theory of Mind (ToM) $\unicode {x2014} $ the ability to reason about the mental states of other people $\unicode {x2014} $ is a key element of our social intelligence. Yet, despite their ever more impressive performance, large-scale neural language models still lack basic theory of mind capabilities out-of-the-box. We posit that simply scaling up models will not imbue them with theory of mind due to the inherently symbolic and implicit nature of the phenomenon, and instead investigate an  Cites: AllenNLP: A Deep Semantic Natural Language Processing Platform
