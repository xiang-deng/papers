Despite heritability estimates that suggest a high ceiling for the classification of many complex genetic disorders, current models have only been moderately successful at accurately classifying cases and controls of these disorders. The knowledge base about the human genome is large and continuously growing, but disorder classification models rarely use any of that information beyond genetic associations. We use three different genomic context data granularities, 4 different machine …
