The easy and accurate identification of varieties is fundamental in agriculture, especially in the olive sector, where more than 1200 olive varieties are currently known worldwide. Varietal misidentification leads to many potential problems for all the actors in the sector: farmers and nursery workers may establish the wrong variety, leading to its maladaptation in the field; olive oil and table olive producers may label and sell a non-authentic product; consumers may be misled; and breeders may  Cites: A Fast and Accurate Dependency Parser using Neural Networks
