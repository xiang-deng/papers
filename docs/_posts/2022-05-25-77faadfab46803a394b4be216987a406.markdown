Researchers suggest unsupervised English machine translation to address the absence of parallel corpus in English translation. Unsupervised pretraining techniques, denoising autoencoders, back translation, and shared latent representation mechanisms are used to simulate the translation task using just monolingual corpora. This paper uses pseudo-parallel data to construct unsupervised neural machine translation (NMT) and dissimilar language pair … Cites: ‪Unsupervised neural machine translation‬
