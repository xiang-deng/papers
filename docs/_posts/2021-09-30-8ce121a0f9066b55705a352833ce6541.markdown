Embodiments of the present invention provide systems, methods, and computer storage media for techniques for identifying textual similarity and performing answer selection. A textual-similarity computing model can use a pre-trained language model to generate vector representations of a question and a candidate answer from a target corpus. The target corpus can be clustered into latent topics (or other latent groupings), and probabilities of a question or candidate answer being in each of the Cites: Squad: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text
