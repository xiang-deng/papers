Achieving high performance for compute-intensive operators in machine learning (ML) workloads is a crucial but challenging task. Many ML and system practitioners rely on vendor libraries or auto-schedulers to do the job. While the former requires large engineering efforts, the latter only supports static-shape workloads in existing works. It is difficult, if not impractical, to apply existing auto-schedulers directly to dynamic-shape workloads, as this leads to extremely long auto-scheduling time.
