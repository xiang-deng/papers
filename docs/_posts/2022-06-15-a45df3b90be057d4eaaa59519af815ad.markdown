With the continuous improvement of the segmentation effect for natural datasets, some studies have gradually been applied to high-resolution remote sensing images (HRRSIs). Due to a large amount of ground object information contained, even objects of the same type present the diversity and complexity of features in different periods or locations. The existing algorithms applied to semantic segmentation of remote sensing images are limited by the short-range context, and the high  Cites: ESPNetv2: A Light-weight, Power Efficient, and General Purpose
