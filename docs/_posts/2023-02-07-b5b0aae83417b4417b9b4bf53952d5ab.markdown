Abstract Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various computer vision tasks. Despite the superior performance achieved, the efficiency and generality of existing methods are highly valued due to their high computational complexity and low generality. In this paper, we propose an efficient and unified NAS framework termed DDPNAS via dynamic distribution pruning, facilitating a theoretical bound on accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we …
