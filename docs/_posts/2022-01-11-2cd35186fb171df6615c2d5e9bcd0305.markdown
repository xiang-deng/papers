Multi-target prediction (MTP) serves as an umbrella term for machine learning tasks that concern the simultaneous prediction of multiple target variables. Classical instantiations are multi-label classification, multivariate regression, multi-task learning, dyadic prediction, zero-shot learning, network inference, and matrix completion. Despite the significant similarities, all these domains have evolved separately into distinct research areas over the last two decades.
