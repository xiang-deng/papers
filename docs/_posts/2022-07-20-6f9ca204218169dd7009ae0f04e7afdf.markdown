Logical rules are widely used to represent domain knowledge and hypothesis, which is fundamental to symbolic reasoning-based human intelligence. Very recently, it has been demonstrated that integrating logical rules into regular learning tasks can further enhance learning performance in a label-efficient manner. Many attempts have been made to learn logical rules automatically from knowledge graphs (KGs). However, a majority of existing methods entirely rely on observed rule instances to  Cites: Convolutional 2d knowledge graph embeddings
