Graph neural networks are essential in mining complex relationships in graphs. However, most methods ignore the global location information of nodes and the discrepancy between symmetrically located nodes, resulting in the inability to distinguish between nodes with homogeneous network neighborhoods. We propose an Anchor-aware Graph Neural Network fused with Information Entropy (IEA-GNN) to capture the global location information of nodes in the graph.
