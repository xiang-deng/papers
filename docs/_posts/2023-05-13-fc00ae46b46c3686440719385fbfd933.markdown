In recent years, deep learning has excellent applications in many fields, especially in computer vision. However, it has been found that deep learning systems are vulnerable to subtle interference, which is almost imperceptible to humans. This leads to model decision errors and potentially disastrous consequences. Therefore, AI scientists have carried out much research on this, and MagNet, Feature Squeezing and Defense-GAN are excellent research achievements. In this paper, we …
