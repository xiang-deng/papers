The purpose of this paper is to explore a data and mechanism co-driven model for predicting the shear strength of reinforced concrete (RC) deep beams. The established experimental database contains 457 RC deep beams with or without web reinforcements and 9 key input features are determined by the shear mechanism of the RC deep beam. Six typical machine-learning models and five mechanism models are selected and compared. The comparison results show that …
