To alleviate the social contradiction between limited medical resources and increasing medical needs, the medical image-assisted diagnosis based on deep learning has become the research focus in Wise Information Technology of med. Most of the existing medical segmentation models based on Convolution or Transformer have achieved relatively sound effects. However, the Convolution- based model with a limited receptive field cannot establish long-distance Cites: ESPNetv2: A Light-weight, Power Efficient, and General Purpose
