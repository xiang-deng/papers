Abstract The Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling (ONTS) problem poses a complex optimization challenge, focused on maximizing the number of tasks executed by a satellite in orbit while adhering to Quality of Service constraints such as priority, execution time-frames, and resource management. Based on mixed integer programming, existing methods rely on branch-and-bound aided algorithms and can struggle to achieve satisfactory computational time performance. In order to …
