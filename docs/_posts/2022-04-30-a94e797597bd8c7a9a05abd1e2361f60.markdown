Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have led to significant accuracy improvements in a myriad of application domains at the cost of larger and more compute-intensive models. Training such models on massive amounts of data typically requires scaling to many compute nodes and relies heavily on collective communication algorithms, such as all-reduce, to exchange the weight gradients between different nodes. The overhead of these collective communication operations Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
