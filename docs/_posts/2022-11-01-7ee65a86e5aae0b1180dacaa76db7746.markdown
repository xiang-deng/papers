To solve the problem that the existing model cannot adequately express inter-sentence structural information, this paper proposes a textual Emotion-Cause Pair (ECP) causal relationship detection method (GAT-ECP-CD) fused with graph attention network (GAT). A structural relationship graph directly propagates causal features from the context to integrate syntactic dependency information between different sentences in a document. First, using a word-level Bidirectional Long Short …
