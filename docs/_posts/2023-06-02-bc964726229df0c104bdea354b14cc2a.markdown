Developers often dedicate significant time to maintaining and refactoring existing code. However, most prior work on generative models for code focuses solely on creating new code, neglecting the unique requirements of editing existing code. In this work, we explore a multi-round code auto-editing setting, aiming to predict edits to a code region based on recent changes within the same codebase. Our model, Coeditor, is a fine-tuned CodeT5 model with enhancements specifically designed for Cites: TypeT5: Seq2seq Type Inference using Static Analysis
