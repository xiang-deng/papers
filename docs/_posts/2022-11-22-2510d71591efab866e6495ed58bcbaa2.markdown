The task of aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to identify sentiment polarities of given aspects in a sentence. Recent advances have demonstrated the advantage of incorporating the syntactic dependency structure with graph convolutional networks (GCNs). However, their performance of these GCN-based methods largely depends on the dependency parsers, which would produce diverse parsing results for a sentence. In this article, we propose a dual GCN (DualGCN) that jointly considers the …
