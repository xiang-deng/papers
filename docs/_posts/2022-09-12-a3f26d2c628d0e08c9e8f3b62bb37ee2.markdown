Abstract Knowledge Graphs (KGs) which can encode structural relations connecting two objects with one or multiple related attributes have become an increasingly popular research direction. Given the superiority of deep learning in representing complex data in continuous space, it is handy to represent KGs data, thus promoting KGs construction, representation, and application. This survey article provides a comprehensive overview of deep learning technologies and KGs by exploring Cites: Zero-shot entity linking by reading entity descriptions
