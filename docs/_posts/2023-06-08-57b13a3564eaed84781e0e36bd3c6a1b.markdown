It is prevalent for a mobile edge device to conduct local inference using a compact machine learning model, which achieves lower latency and less compromise of data privacy as compared to cloud-based inference. To work in a new environment, the compact model needs to be adapted to the target data from the environment so as to maintain a high inference accuracy. However, directly applying domain adaptation to the compact model leads to a low inference accuracy. Hence, a scheme called  Cites: LST: Ladder Side-Tuning for Parameter and Memory Efficient
