In business cases, there is an increasing need for automated long form question answering (LFQA) systems from business documents, however data for training such systems is not easily achievable.

In this paper, we present a method to rapidly develop an LFQA dataset from existing logs of help-desk data without need of manual human Cites: Answering Open-Domain Questions of Varying Reasoning Steps
