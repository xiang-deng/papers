Experts across diverse disciplines are often interested in making sense of large text collections. Traditionally, this challenge is approached either by noisy unsupervised techniques such as topic models, or by following a manual theme discovery process. In this paper, we expand the definition of a theme to account for more than just a word distribution, and include generalized attributes and concepts emerging from the data. Then, we propose an interactive neuro-symbolic framework that receives expert Cites: Closing the loop: User-centered design and evaluation of a human
