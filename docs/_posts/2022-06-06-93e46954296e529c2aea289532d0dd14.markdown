The multi-hop reading comprehension (RC) is challenging for machine reading comprehension. It is crucial for multi-hop RC to comprehend complex questions and contents between multiple paragraphs. In this paper, we propose a strategy of keywords-aware dynamic graph neural network (KA-DGN) to improve the performance of multi-hop reading comprehension. First of all, KA-DGN focuses on the salient information in the text, extracts keywords from the question and context. A Cites: Detecting formal thought disorder by deep contextualized word
