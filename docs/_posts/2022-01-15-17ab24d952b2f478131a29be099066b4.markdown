BlenderBot 2.0 is a dialogue model that represents open-domain chatbots by reflecting real-time information and remembering user information for an extended period using an internet search module and multi-session. Nonetheless, the model still has room for improvement. To this end, we examined BlenderBot 2.0 limitations and errors from three perspectives: model, data, and user. From the data point of view, we highlight the unclear guidelines provided to workers during the Cites: TaBERT: Pretraining for Joint Understanding of Textual and
