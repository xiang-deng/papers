Unsupervised person re-identification (ReID) aims at learning discriminative identity features for person retrieval without any annotations. Recent advances accomplish this task by leveraging clustering-based pseudo labels, but these pseudo labels are inevitably noisy which deteriorate model performance. In this paper, we propose a Neighbour Consistency guided Pseudo Label Refinement (NCPLR) framework, which can be regarded as a transductive form of label propagation under the  Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
