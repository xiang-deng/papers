We develop a method for understanding specific predictions made by (global) predictive models by constructing (local) models tailored to each specific observation (these are also called explanations in the literature). Unlike existing work that explains specific observations by approximating global models in the vicinity of these observations, we fit models that are globally-consistent with predictions made by the global model on past data. We focus on rule-based models (also known as Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
