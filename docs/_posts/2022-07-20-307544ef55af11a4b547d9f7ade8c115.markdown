As critically ill patients frequently develop anemia or coagulopathy, transfusion of blood products is a frequent intervention in the Intensive Care Units (ICU). However, inappropriate transfusion decisions made by physicians are often associated with increased risk of complications and higher hospital costs. In this work, we aim to develop a decision support tool that uses available patient information for transfusion decision-making on three common blood products (red blood cells, platelets, and Cites: Empirical evaluation of gated recurrent neural networks on
