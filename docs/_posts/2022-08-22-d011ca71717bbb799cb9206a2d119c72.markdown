Link prediction in knowledge graph embedding is a meaningful research topic. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) focuses on the problem of predicting missing links based on triples. Neural networks have been the paradigm of choice in knowledge graph tasks. However, the general network KGE models lack attention to the spatial location connection between entities and relations and have a weakness in that they cannot capture global information. We found that multiview feature Cites: Observed Versus Latent Features for Knowledge Base and Text
