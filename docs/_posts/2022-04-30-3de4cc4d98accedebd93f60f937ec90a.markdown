Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are a popular way to structure and represent knowledge in a machine-readable way. While KGs serve as the foundation for many applications, the automatic construction of these KGs from texts is a challenging task where Open Information Extraction techniques are prominently leveraged. In this paper, we focus on generating a domain-specific knowledge graph based on art-historic texts from a digitized text collection. We describe the combined use and adaption of existing Cites: Open information extraction from the web
