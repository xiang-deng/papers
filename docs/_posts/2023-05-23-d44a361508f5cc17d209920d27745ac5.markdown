Missing data pattern identification and recovery (MDIR) is vital for accurate air pollution monitoring. To recover the missing air pollution data, GCN-ST-MDIR, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based MDIR framework, is proposed to identify daily missing data patterns and automatically select the best recovery method. GCN-ST-MDIR presents four novelties:(1) A new graph construction is developed to improve GCN data representation for MDIR using ST similarity matrix and domain  Cites: Ask me anything: Dynamic memory networks for natural language
