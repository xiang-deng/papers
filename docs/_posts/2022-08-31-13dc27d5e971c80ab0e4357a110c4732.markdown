Relation extraction is the task of extracting relational facts between entities from plain text. When the extraction scope is extended to the document level, entities may exist in dif-ferent sentences. This requires the model to consider the in-teraction between multiple sentences comprehensively. Thus, document-level relation extraction becomes especially chal-lenging. Most existing models adopt entity representation learning to tackle this challenge. Nevertheless, they gener-ally perform Cites: End-to-end Relation Extraction using LSTMs on Sequences and
