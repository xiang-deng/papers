Two machine learning (ML) models are investigated for retrieving sea surface temperature (SST) from passive microwave (PMW) satellite observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning RadiometerEarth Observing System (AMSR-E) and auxiliary data, such as ERA5 reanalysis data. The first model is the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XBG) model and the second is a multilayer perceptron neural network (NN). The performance of the two ML algorithms is compared to that of an existing Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
