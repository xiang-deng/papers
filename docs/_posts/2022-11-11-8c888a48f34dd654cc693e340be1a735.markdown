Prompt learning recently become an effective linguistic tool to motivate the PLMs  knowledge on few-shot-setting tasks. However, studies have shown the lack of robustness still exists in prompt learning, since suitable initialization of continuous prompt and expert-first manual prompt are essential in fine-tuning process. What is more, human also utilize their comparative ability to motivate their existing knowledge for distinguishing different examples. Motivated by this, we explore how …
