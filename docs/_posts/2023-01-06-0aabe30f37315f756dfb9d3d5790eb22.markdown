Many recent works on understanding deep learning try to quantify how much individual data instances influence the optimization and generalization of a model, either by analyzing the behavior of the model during training or by measuring the performance gap of the model when the instance is removed from the dataset. Such approaches reveal characteristics and importance of individual instances, which may provide useful information in diagnosing and improving deep learning. However …
