Artificial intelligence (AI) tools based on large language models have acheived human-level performance on some computer programming tasks. We report several experiments using GPT-4 to generate computer code. These experiments demonstrate that AI code generation using the current generation of tools, while powerful, requires substantial human validation to ensure accurate performance. We also demonstrate that GPT-4 refactoring of existing code can significantly improve  Cites: Chi, Quoc Le, and Denny Zhou. 2023. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
