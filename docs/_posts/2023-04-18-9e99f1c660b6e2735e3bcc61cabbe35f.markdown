Sparse problem is the major challenge in knowledge graph completion. However, existing knowledge graph completion methods utilize entity as the basic granularity, and face the semantic under-transfer problem. In this paper, we propose an analogy-triple enhanced fine-grained sequence-to-sequence model for sparse knowledge graph completion. Specifically, the entities are first split into different levels of granularity, such as sub-entity, word, and sub-word. Then we extract a set of analogy …
