The growing deployment of human-robot collaborative processes in several industrial applications, such as handling, welding, and assembly, unfolds the pursuit of systems which are able to manage large heterogeneous teams and, at the same time, monitor the execution of complex tasks. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for dynamic role allocation and collaborative task planning in a mixed human-robot team of arbitrary size. The architecture capitalizes on a centralized …
