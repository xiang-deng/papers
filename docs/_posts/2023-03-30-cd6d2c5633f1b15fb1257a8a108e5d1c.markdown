Despite the recent advances in deep neural networks, standard convolutional kernels limit the applications of these networks to the Euclidean domain only. Considering the geodesic nature of the measurement of the earth s surface, remote sensing is one such area that can benefit from non-Euclidean and spherical domains. For this purpose, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network architecture for spatial and spatio-temporal classification using satellite imagery. We propose a Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
