Many complex systems in the real world can be characterized by attributed networks. To mine the potential information in these networks, deep embedded clustering, which obtains node representations and clusters simultaneously, has been paid much attention in recent years. Under the assumption of consistency for data in different views, the cluster structure of network topology and that of node attributes should be consistent for an attributed network. However, many existing methods … Cites: ‪Adaptive Graph Encoder for Attributed Graph Embedding‬
