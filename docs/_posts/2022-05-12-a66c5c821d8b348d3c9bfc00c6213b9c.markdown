We want computer vision models to understand the rich world captured in images and video. This requires not just recognizing objects, but identifying their relationships and interactions. Combining contributions in both neural architecture and loss design, we expand the capacity of convolutional networks to express such interactions and solve a broad range of structured computer vision tasks.
