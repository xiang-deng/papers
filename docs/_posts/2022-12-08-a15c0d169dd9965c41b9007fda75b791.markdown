The most popular topic modelling algorithm, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, produces a simple set of topics. However, topics naturally exist in a hierarchy with larger, more general super-topics and smaller, more specific sub-topics. We develop a novel topic modelling algorithm, Community Topic, that mines communities from word co-occurrence networks to produce topics. The fractal structure of networks provides a natural topic hierarchy where sub-topics can be found by iteratively mining the sub …
