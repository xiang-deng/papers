Poor chip solder joints can severely affect the quality of the finished printed circuit boards (PCBs). Due to the diversity of solder joint defects and the scarcity of anomaly data, it is a challenging task to automatically and accurately detect all types of solder joint defects in the production process in real time. To address this issue, we propose a flexible framework based on contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL). In this framework, we first design several special data augmentation approaches to …
