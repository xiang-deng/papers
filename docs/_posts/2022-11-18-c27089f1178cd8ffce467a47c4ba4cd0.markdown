Neural networks are known to be biased towards learning mechanisms that help identify $ spurious\, attributes $, yielding features that do not generalize well under distribution shifts. To understand and address this limitation, we study the geometry of neural network loss landscapes through the lens of $ mode\, connectivity $, the observation that minimizers of neural networks are connected via simple paths of low loss. Our work addresses two questions:(i) do minimizers that encode dissimilar …
