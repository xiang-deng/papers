At present, knowledge embedding methods are widely used in the field of knowledge graph reasoning, and have been successfully applied to those with large entities and relationships. However, in research and production environments, there are a large number of knowledge graphs with a small number of entities and relations, which are called sparse knowledge graphs. Limited by the performance of knowledge extraction methods or some other reasons (some common-sense information does …
