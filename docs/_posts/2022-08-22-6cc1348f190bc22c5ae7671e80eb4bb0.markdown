Learning a domain-invariant representation has become one of the most popular approaches for domain adaptation/generalization. In this paper, we show that the invariant representation may not be sufficient to guarantee a good generalization, where the labeling function shift should be taken into consideration. Inspired by this, we first derive a new generalization upper bound on the empirical risk that explicitly considers the labeling function shift. We then propose Domain-specific Risk Cites: Modeling the Second Player in Distributionally Robust Optimization
