Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been promising functional materials for developing solar cells, lasers, photodetectors, and sensors due to their outstanding optical and electrical characteristics. However, they suffer from very poor stability for their high sensitivity to some environmental factors such as temperature, UV irradiation, pH, and polar solvent, which limits their extensive practical applications. Herein, a derived metal organic framework material, Pb-ZIF-8, was prepared as a …
