In the field of smart justice, handling legal cases through artificial intelligence technology is a research hotspot. Traditional judgment prediction methods are mainly based on feature models and classification algorithms. The former is difficult to describe cases from multiple angles and capture the correlation information between different case modules, while requires a wealth of legal expertise and manual labeling. The latter is unable to accurately extract the most useful information …
