Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prediction performance for a growing array of tasks. However, their rapid proliferation and increasing opaqueness have created a growing need for interpretability. Here, we ask whether we can automatically obtain natural language explanations for black box text modules. A  text module  is any function that maps text to a scalar continuous value, such as a submodule within an LLM or a fitted model of a brain …
