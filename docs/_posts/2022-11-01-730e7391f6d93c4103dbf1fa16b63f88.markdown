Single-index models are a class of functions given by an unknown univariate``link function applied to an unknown one-dimensional projection of the input. These models are particularly relevant in high dimension, when the data might present low-dimensional structure that learning algorithms should adapt to. While several statistical aspects of this model, such as the sample complexity of recovering the relevant (one-dimensional) subspace, are well-understood, they rely on tailored  Cites: Towards understanding hierarchical learning: Benefits of neural
