As software vulnerabilities grow in volume and complexity, researchers proposed various Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approaches to help under-resourced security analysts to find, detect, and localize vulnerabilities. However, security analysts still have to spend a huge amount of effort to manually fix or repair such vulnerable functions. Recent work proposed an NMT-based Automated Vulnerability Repair, but it is still far from perfect due to various limitations. In this paper, we propose  Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
