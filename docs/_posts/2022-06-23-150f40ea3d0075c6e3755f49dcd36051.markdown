In this paper, we consider the problem of low-speed convergence in Reinforcement Learning (RL). As a solution, various potential-based reward shaping techniques were proposed to form the potential function. Learning a potential function is still challenging and comparable to building a value function from scratch. In this work, our main contribution is proposing a new scheme for reward shaping, which combines (1) the Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GCRN),(2) augmented Cites: Keeping your distance: Solving sparse reward tasks using self
