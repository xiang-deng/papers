Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved excellent performance in a variety of evaluation benchmarks, they still struggle in complex reasoning tasks which require specific knowledge and multi-hop reasoning. To improve the reasoning abilities, we propose\textbf {ChatCoT}, a tool-augmented chain-of-thought reasoning framework for chat-based LLMs. In ChatCoT, we model the chain-of-thought~(CoT) reasoning as multi-turn conversations, to utilize tools in a more  Cites: ART: Automatic multi-step reasoning and tool-use for large
