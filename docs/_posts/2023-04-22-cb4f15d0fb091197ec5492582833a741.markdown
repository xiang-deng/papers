Precise measurements of the energy of jets emerging from particle collisions at the LHC are essential for a vast majority of physics searches at the CMS experiment. In this study, we leverage well-established deep learning models for point clouds and CMS open data to improve the energy calibration of particle jets. To enable production-ready machine learning based jet energy calibration an end-to-end pipeline is built on the Kubeflow cloud platform. The pipeline allowed us to scale up  Cites: QCD-aware recursive neural networks for jet physics
