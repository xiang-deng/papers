One of the key challenges of automatic story generation is how to generate a long narrative that can maintain fluency, relevance, and coherence. Despite recent progress, current story generation systems still face the challenge of how to effectively capture contextual and event features, which has a profound impact on a model s generation performance. To address these challenges, we present EtriCA, a novel neural generation model, which improves the relevance and coherence of the …
