We propose a novel method to accelerate training and inference process of recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) based on the guidance from a co-trained connectionist temporal classification (CTC) model. We made a key assumption that if an encoder embedding frame is classified as a blank frame by the CTC model, it is likely that this frame will be aligned to blank for all the partial alignments or hypotheses in RNN-T and it can be discarded from the decoder input. We also show  Cites: LegoNN: Building Modular Encoder-Decoder Models
