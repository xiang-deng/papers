Grey theory is capable of representing uncertainty and has proved its applicability in prioritizing features for estimation problems and various decision-making problems. This study analyses the effectiveness of the application of grey theory in feature selection for daily dew point temperature (DPT) and daily pan-evaporation (PAN-EVP) estimation models. Feature subset identified by grey theory and subsets selected based on very high, high, medium, and low Pearson correlation coefficient Cites: Predicting with high correlation features
