As one of the earth s key ecosystems, rivers have been intensively studied and modelled through the application of machine learning (ML). With the amount of large data available, these computer algorithms are ever increasing in numerous fields, although there is ongoing scepticism and scholars still question the actual impact and deliverables of algorithms. This study aims to provide a systematic review of the stateoftheart MLbased techniques, trends, opportunities and challenges in river  Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
