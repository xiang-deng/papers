ChatGPT demonstrates immense potential to transform software engineering (SE) by exhibiting outstanding performance in tasks such as code and document generation. However, the high reliability and risk control requirements of SE make the lack of interpretability for ChatGPT a concern. To address this issue, we carried out a study evaluating ChatGPT s capabilities and limitations in SE. We broke down the abilities needed for AI models to tackle SE tasks into three categories: 1) syntax Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
