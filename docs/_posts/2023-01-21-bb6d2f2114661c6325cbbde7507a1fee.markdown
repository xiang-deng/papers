In AI-assisted decision-making, it is critical for human decision-makers to know when to trust AI and when to trust themselves. However, prior studies calibrated human trust only based on AI confidence indicating AI s correctness likelihood (CL) but ignored humans CL, hindering optimal team decision-making. To mitigate this gap, we proposed to promote humans appropriate trust based on the CL of both sides at a task-instance level. We first modeled humans CL by approximating their decision Cites: Does the whole exceed its parts? the effect of ai explanations on
