Large pre-trained language models are capable of generating varied and fluent texts. Starting from the prompt, these models generate a narrative that can develop unpredictably. The existing methods of controllable text generation, which guide the narrative in the text in the user-specified direction, require creating a training corpus and an additional time-consuming training procedure. The paper proposes and investigates Collocation2Text, a plug-and-play method for automatic controllable text …
