Fundamental theory and practical algorithms of weakly supervised classification, emphasizing an approach based on empirical risk minimization. Standard machine learning techniques require large amounts of labeled data to work well. When we apply machine learning to problems in the physical world, however, it is extremely difficult to collect such quantities of labeled data. In this book Masashi Sugiyama, Han Bao, Takashi Ishida, Nan Lu, Tomoya Sakai and Gang Niu present theory and Cites: From instance-level constraints to space-level constraints: Making
