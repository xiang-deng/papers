Abstract Knowledge graph (KG) completion has been long studied on link prediction task to infer missing relations, while literals are paid less attention due to the non-discrete and rich-semantic challenges. Numerical attributes such as height, age and birthday are different from other literals that they can be calculated and estimated, thus have huge potential to be predicted and play important roles in a series of tasks. However, only a few researches have made preliminary attempts to predict …
