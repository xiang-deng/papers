Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely employed to solve log anomaly detection and outperform a range of conventional methods. They have attained such striking success because they can usually explore and extract semantic information from a large volume of log data, which helps to infer complex log anomaly patterns more accurately. Despite its success in generalization accuracy, this data-driven approach can still suffer from a high vulnerability to adversarial attacks, which …
