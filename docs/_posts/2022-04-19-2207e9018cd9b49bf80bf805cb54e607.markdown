Organic semiconductorbased photovoltaic (OPV) devices have many properties that make them attractive for indoor applications, such as tailorable light absorption, low embodied energy manufacturing and cost, structural conformality, and low material toxicity. Compared to their use as organic solar cells (OSCs) for standard outdoor solar harvesting, indoor OPV (IOPV) devices operate at low light intensities, and thus demonstrate different areascaling behavior. In particular, it appears as though the Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
