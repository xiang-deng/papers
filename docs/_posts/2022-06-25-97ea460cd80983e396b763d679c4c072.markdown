In this work, we derive the semantics of a given English query and convert it into its equivalent SQL query. Instead of using neural networks for semantic analysis of English queries, we opt for a Context Free Grammar approach. Most neural-network-based systems can handle only one semantic at a time, whereas, because of the flexibility offered by our CFG approach, our system manages to handle simultaneous usage of conjunctive, disjunctive, and negative semantics. It also handles complex  Cites: Spider: A Large-Scale Human-Labeled Dataset for Complex and
