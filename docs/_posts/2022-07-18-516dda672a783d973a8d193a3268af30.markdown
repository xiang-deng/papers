Probabilistic topic models, such as LDA, are standard text analysis algorithms that provide predictive and latent topic representation for a corpus. However, due to the unsupervised training process, it is difficult to verify the assumption that the latent space discovered by these models is generally meaningful and valuable. This paper introduces a two-stage LDA algorithm to estimate latent topics in text documents and use readability scores to link the identified topics to a linguistically motivated latent Cites: Applications of topic models
