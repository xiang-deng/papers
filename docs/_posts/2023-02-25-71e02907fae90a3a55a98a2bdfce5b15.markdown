With knowledge graphs (KGs) at the center of numerous applications such as recommender systems and question answering, the need for generalized pipelines to construct and continuously update such KGs is increasing. While the individual steps that are necessary to create KGs from unstructured (eg text) and structured data sources (eg databases) are mostly well-researched for their one-shot execution, their adoption for incremental KG updates and the interplay of the individual steps …
