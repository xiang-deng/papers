As the complexity of machine learning (ML) models increases and the applications in different (and critical) domains grow, there is a strong demand for more interpretable and trustworthy ML. One straightforward and model-agnostic way to interpret complex ML models is to train surrogate models, such as rule sets and decision trees, that sufficiently approximate the original ones while being simpler and easier-to-explain. Yet, rule sets can become very lengthy, with many if-else statements, and  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
