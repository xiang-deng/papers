Zero-shot node classification is a very important challenge for classical semi-supervised node classification algorithms, such as Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) which has been widely applied to node classification. In order to predict the unlabeled nodes from unseen classes, zero-shot node classification needs to transfer knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes. It is crucial to consider the relations between the classes in zero-shot node classification. However, the GCN Cites: Benchmarking zero-shot text classification: Datasets, evaluation
