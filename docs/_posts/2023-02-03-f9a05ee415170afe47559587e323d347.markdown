Background. Code-line-level bugginess identification (CLBI) is a vital technique that can facilitate developers to identify buggy lines without expending a large amount of human effort. Most of the existing studies tried to mine the characteristics of source codes to train supervised prediction models, which have been reported to be able to discriminate buggy code lines amongst others in a target program. Problem. However, several simple and clear code characteristics, such as complexity of code …
