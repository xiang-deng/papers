Patents have been increasingly used as an instrument to study innovation strategies and financial performance of firms recently. Early prediction of patent application success can help firms make better decisions about their investment and innovation strategies. However, predicting patent application outcome is a difficult task that requires the understanding of both deep domain knowledge and complicated legal procedures. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework to mine both  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
