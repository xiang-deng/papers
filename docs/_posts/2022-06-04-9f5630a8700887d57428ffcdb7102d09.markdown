Abstract Multistep Human Density Prediction (MHDP) is an emerging challenge in urban mobility with lots of applications in several domains such as Smart Cities, Edge Computing and Epidemiology Modeling. The basic goal is to estimate the density of people gathered in a set of urban Regions of Interests (ROIs) or Points of Interests (POIs) in a forecast horizon of different granularities. Accordingly, this paper aims to contribute and go beyond the existing literature on human density prediction Cites: WiFiMod: Transformer-based Indoor Human Mobility Modeling
