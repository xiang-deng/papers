Deep learning is becoming increasingly adopted in business and industry due to its ability to transform large quantities of data into high-performing models. These models, however, are generally regarded as black boxes, which, in spite of their performance, could prevent their use. In this context, the field of eXplainable AI attempts to develop techniques that temper the impenetrable nature of the models and promote a level of understanding of their behavior. Here we present our  Cites: Why Should I Trust You?: Explaining the Predictions of Any
