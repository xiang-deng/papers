As the number of academic publications increase, preparing a literature review becomes more challenging. This paper introduces an automated literature review support system to ease the literature review process for academia with reference graphs, abstract and full document summaries, paper clusters by keywords, abstracts, and abstract summaries combined. The output of the proposed system may ease exploring the state-of-the-art research.
