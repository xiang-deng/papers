A series of datasets and models have been proposed for summaries generated for well-formatted documents such as news articles. Dialogue summaries, however, have been under explored. In this paper, we present the first dataset with fine-grained factual error annotations named DIASUMFACT. We define fine-grained factual error detection as a sentence-level multi-label classification problem, and we evaluate two state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on our dataset. Both models yield sub Cites: Improving faithfulness in abstractive summarization with contrast
