Most of the existing recommendation systems using deep learning are based on the method of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). However, due to some inherent defects of RNN, recommendation systems based on RNN are not only very time consuming but also unable to capture the long-range dependencies between user comments. Through the sentiment analysis of user comments, we can better capture the characteristics of user interest.
