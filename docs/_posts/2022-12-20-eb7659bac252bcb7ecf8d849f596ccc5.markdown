Surrogate models are indispensable tools in uncertainty quantification and global sensitivity analysis. Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is one of the most widely used surrogate models, thanks to its faster convergence rate compared to Monte Carlo simulation. In some cases, especially for complex problems, analyzing the complexity of the random input–output relationship (eg, nonlinearity and interactions between input variables) may reveal additional information and useful insight. To that …
