In the last years, one of the main challenges in Industry 4.0 concerns maintenance operations optimization, which has been widely dealt with several predictive maintenance frameworks aiming to jointly reduce maintenance costs and downtime intervals. Nevertheless, the most recent and effective frameworks mainly rely on deep learning models, but their internal representations (black box) are too complex for human understanding making difficult explain their predictions. This issue can be …
