Objective Epilepsy is characterized by spontaneous seizures that recur at unexpected times. Yet, using yearslong EEG recordings, we previously found that patientreported seizures consistently occur when interictal epileptiform activity (IEA) cyclically builds up over days. This multidien (multiday) interictalictal relationship, which is shared across patients, may bear phasic information for forecasting seizures, even if individual patterns of seizure timing are unknown.
