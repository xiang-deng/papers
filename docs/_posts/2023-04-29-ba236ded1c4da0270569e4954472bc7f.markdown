Joint entity and relation extraction has achieved impressive advances in NLP, such as document understanding and knowledge graph construction. The typical methods for entity and relation extraction typically break down the joint task into several smaller components or stages for ease of implementation, but this leads to a loss of the interconnected knowledge in the triple. Hence, we propose to model the triple in one module jointly. Furthermore, the labeling of a joint entity and relation extraction Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
