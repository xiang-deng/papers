Large language models trained on massive amounts of natural language data and code have shown impressive capabilities in automatic code generation scenarios. Development and evaluation of these models has largely been driven by offline functional correctness metrics, which consider a task to be solved if the generated code passes corresponding unit tests. While functional correctness is clearly an important property of a code generation model, we argue that it may not fully capture Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
