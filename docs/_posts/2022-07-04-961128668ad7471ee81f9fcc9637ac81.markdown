Pre-trained code representation models such as CodeBERT have demonstrated superior performance in a variety of software engineering tasks, yet they are often heavy in complexity, quadratically with the length of the input sequence. Our empirical analysis of CodeBERT s attention reveals that CodeBERT pays more attention to certain types of tokens and statements such as keywords and data-relevant statements. Based on these findings, we propose DietCodeBERT, which …
