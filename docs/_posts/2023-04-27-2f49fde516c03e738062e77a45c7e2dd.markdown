This paper proposes a method to optimize tokenization for the performance improvement of already trained downstream models. Our method generates tokenization results attaining lower loss values of a given downstream model on the training data for restricting vocabularies and trains a tokenizer reproducing the tokenization results. Therefore, our method can be applied to variety of tokenization methods, while existing work cannot due to the simultaneous learning of the …
