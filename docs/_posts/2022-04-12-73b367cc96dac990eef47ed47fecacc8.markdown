Acquiring training data to improve the robustness of dialog systems can be a painstakingly long process. In this work, we propose a method to reduce the cost and effort of creating new conversational agents by artificially generating more data from existing examples, using paraphrase generation. Our proposed approach can kick- start a dialog system with little human effort, and brings its performance to a level satisfactory enough for allowing actual interactions with real end-users.
