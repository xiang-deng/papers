In this paper we share findings from our effort to build practical machine translation (MT) systems capable of translating across over one thousand languages. We describe results in three research domains:(i) Building clean, web-mined datasets for 1500+ languages by leveraging semi-supervised pre-training for language identification and developing data-driven filtering techniques;(ii) Developing practical MT models for under-served languages by leveraging massively multilingual models Cites: AfroMT: Pretraining Strategies and Reproducible Benchmarks for
