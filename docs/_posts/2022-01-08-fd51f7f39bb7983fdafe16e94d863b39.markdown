Capturing the composition patterns of relations is a vital task in knowledge graph completion. It also serves as a fundamental step towards multi-hop reasoning over learned knowledge. Previously, several rotation-based translational methods have been developed to model composite relations using the product of a series of complex-valued diagonal matrices. However, these methods tend to make several oversimplified assumptions on the composite relations, eg, forcing them to be Cites: Convolutional 2d knowledge graph embeddings
