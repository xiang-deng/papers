Graph neural networks have triggered a resurgence of graph-based text classification methods, defining today s state of the art. We show that a simple multi- layer perceptron (MLP) using a Bag of Words (BoW) outperforms the recent graph- based models TextGCN and HeteGCN in an inductive text classification setting and is comparable with HyperGAT in single-label classification. We also run our own experiments on multi-label classification, where the simple MLP outperforms the Cites: Mobilebert: a compact task-agnostic bert for resource-limited devices
