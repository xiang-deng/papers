The Natural Language Inference (NLI) task often requires reasoning over multiple steps to reach the conclusion. While the necessity of generating such intermediate steps (instead of a summary explanation) has gained popular support, it is unclear how to generate such steps without complete end-to-end supervision and how such generated steps can be further utilized. In this work, we train a sequence-to-sequence model to generate only the next step given an NLI premise and hypothesis Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
