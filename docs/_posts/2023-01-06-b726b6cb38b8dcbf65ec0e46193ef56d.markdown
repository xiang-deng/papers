Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) is based on analysis and understanding of questions and knowledge graph (KG) to obtain the answers. However, due to the complexity of natural language questions and the incompleteness of KG, the accuracy of answers can not be improved effectively. The knowledge graph reasoning technology can infer the missing entities in the KG and the implied relations between entities. Therefore, its application in KGQA can further  Cites: The value of semantic parse labeling for knowledge base question
