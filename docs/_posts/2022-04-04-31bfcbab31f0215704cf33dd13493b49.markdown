Interoperability is a central problem in digitization and System of Systems (SoS) engineering which concerns the capacity of systems to exchange information and cooperate. The task to dynamically establish interoperability between heterogeneous cyber-physical systems (CPSs) at run-time is a challenging problem. Different aspects of the interoperability problem have been studied in fields such as SoS, neural translation and agent based systems, but there are no unifying solutions Cites: Capacity, Bandwidth, and Compositionality in Emergent Language
