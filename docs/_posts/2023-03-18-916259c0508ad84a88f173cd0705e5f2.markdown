Over the past decade, knowledge graphs (KGs) have become popular for capturing structured domain knowledge. Knowledge graphs particularly allow the effortless integration of heterogeneous data into a coherent model. Besides applications in data integration, KGs are at the center of many artificial intelligence studies as an expressive data model for representation learning purposes. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods produce a latent representation of KGs entities showing …
