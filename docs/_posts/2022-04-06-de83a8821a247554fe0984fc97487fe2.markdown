Abstract Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely accepted as powerful tools for modeling the complex relationships between concepts and developing knowledge- based services. In recent years, researchers in the field of power systems have explored KGs to develop intelligent dispatching systems for increasingly large power grids. With multiple power grid dispatching knowledge graphs (PDKGs) constructed by different agencies, the knowledge fusion of different PDKGs is useful for providing Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
