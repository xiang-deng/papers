Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved superior accuracy in many visual-related tasks. However, the inference process through a CNN s intermediate layers is opaque, making it difficult to interpret such networks or develop trust in their operation. In this paper, we introduce SIGN method for modeling the network s hidden layer activity using probabilistic models. The activity patterns in layers of interest are modeled as Gaussian mixture models, and transition probabilities …
