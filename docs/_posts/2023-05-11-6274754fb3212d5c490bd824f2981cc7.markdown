Mixed-initiative dialogue tasks involve repeated exchanges of information and conversational control. Conversational agents gain control by generating responses that follow particular dialogue intents or strategies, prescribed by a policy planner. The standard approach has been fine-tuning pre-trained language models to perform generation conditioned on these intents. However, these supervised generation models are limited by the cost and quality of data annotation. We instead …
