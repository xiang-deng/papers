Abstract The Pursuit-Evasion (PE) problem is a well-known problem in which an agentthe Pursuerattempts to catch another agentthe Evaderbefore it reaches some target destination. We explore a variant of the PE problem called PE with Fixed Evader plans (PE-FEP), in which an external opponent modeling tool provides a distribution over the plans the Evader agent may select. This PE variant, which is motivated by real-life problems, is particularly challenging for existing PE algorithms  Cites: Opponent modeling in deep reinforcement learning
