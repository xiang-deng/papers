Structured knowledge bases (KBs) are a foundation of many intelligent applications, yet are notoriously incomplete. Language models (LMs) have recently been proposed for unsupervised knowledge base completion (KBC), yet, despite encouraging initial results, questions regarding their suitability remain open. Existing evaluations often fall short because they only evaluate on popular subjects, or sample already existing facts from KBs. In this work, we introduce a novel, more Cites: Do Pre-trained Models Benefit Knowledge Graph Completion? A
