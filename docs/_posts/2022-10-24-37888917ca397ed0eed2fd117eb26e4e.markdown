The democratisation of deep learning (DL) in recent years has led to an increasing presence of DL algorithms influencing our everyday lives, from recommending us our next book to deciding whether we are granted a loan or not. Although DL has allowed for a major performance boost in data-driven applications, the decisions made by neural networks are completely opaque to humans, rendering their suitability questionable for applications where the model needs to be verifiable …
