Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been an emerging solution for graph self-supervised learning. The core principle of GCL is to reduce the distance between samples in the positive view, but increase the distance between samples in the negative view. While achieving promising performances, current GCL methods still suffer from two limitations:(1) uncontrollable validity of augmentation, that graph perturbation may produce invalid views against semantics and feature-topology  Cites: SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings
