Most database management systems cache pages from storage in a main memory buffer pool. To do this, they either rely on a hash table that translates page identifiers into pointers, or on pointer swizzling which avoids this translation. In this work, we propose vmcache, a buffer manager design that instead uses hardware-supported virtual memory to translate page identifiers to virtual memory addresses. In contrast to existing mmap-based approaches, the DBMS retains control over page faulting …
