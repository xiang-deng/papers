Graph alignment, which aims at identifying corresponding entities across multiple networks, has been widely applied in various domains. As the graphs to be aligned are usually constructed from different sources, the inconsistency issues of structures and features between two graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Most existing methods follow the``embed-then-cross-compare paradigm, which computes node embeddings in each graph and then processes node correspondences based Cites: Visual pivoting for (unsupervised) entity alignment
