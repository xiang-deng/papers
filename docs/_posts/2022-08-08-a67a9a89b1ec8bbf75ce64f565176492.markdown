Relation extraction, as an important part of knowl-edge graph and natural language processing, aims to extract semantic relations between entities by understanding text, which has attracted great interest of researchers. Recently, with the rise of the advanced technology of graph neural networks, numer-ous methods have emerged that employ graph neural network techniques to address relation extraction tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies provide a complete picture of Cites: ZeroShotCeres: Zero-shot relation extraction from semi-structured
