Named entity recognition and relation extraction are core sub-tasks of relational triple extraction. Recent studies have used parameter sharing or joint decoding to create interaction between these two tasks. However, ensuring the specificity of task-specific traits while the two tasks interact properly is a huge difficulty. We propose a multi-gate encoder that models bidirectional task interaction while keeping sufficient feature specificity based on gating mechanism in this paper. Precisely, we design …
