This paper proposes a novel Cartesian coordinated humanrobot collaboration framework derived from the hidden state-space models, which are established on the behaviour cloning of both the human and robot in a nonparametric form by using dual quaternion on Riemannian manifold. Based on the Taylor linearisation, this framework could provide an analytical approximation of the posterior distribution and hence infer six DoF Cartesian hidden state variables of the collaborative manipulator  Cites: Legibility and predictability of robot motion
