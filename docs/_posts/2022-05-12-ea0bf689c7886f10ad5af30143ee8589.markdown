In the recent era, graph neural networks are widely used on vision-to-language tasks and achieved promising results. In particular, graph convolution network (GCN) is capable of capturing spatial and semantic relationships needed for visual question answering (VQA). But, applying GCN on VQA datasets with different subtasks can lead to varying results. Also, the training and testing size, evaluation metrics and hyperparameter used are other factors that affect VQA results. These, factors can be Cites: On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: Encoder
