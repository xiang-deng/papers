This paper proposes an approach for entity resolution (ER) and conflict resolution (CR) in large-scale graphs. It is based on a class of Graph Cleaning Rules (GCRs), which support the primitives of relational data cleaning rules, and may embed machine learning classifiers as predicates. As opposed to previous graph rules, GCRs are defined with a dual graph pattern to accommodate irregular structures of schemaless graphs, and adopt patterns of a star form to reduce the complexity. We …
