The present work uses a full-field crystal plasticity model with a first principles-informed dislocation density (DD) hardening law to identify the key microstructural features correlated with micromechanical fields localization, or hotspots, in polycrystalline Ni. An ensemble learning approach to machine learning interpreted with Shapley additive explanation was implemented to predict nonlinear correlations between microstructural features and micromechanical stress and strain hotspots Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
