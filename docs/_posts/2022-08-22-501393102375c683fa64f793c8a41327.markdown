Noisy labels represent one of the key issues in supervised machine learning. Existing work for label noise reduction mainly takes a probabilistic approach that infers true labels from data distributions in low-level feature spaces. Such an approach is not only limited by its capability to learn high-quality data representations, but also by the low predictive power of data distributions in inferring true classes. To address those problems, we introduce Nessy, a neuro-symbolic Cites: Scalable zero-shot entity linking with dense entity retrieval
