The MOF platform based on soc topology showed recent developments for gas storage applications. soc-MOFs with very open structures, such as Al-soc-MOF-1, exhibited promising gravimetric storage performance but with compromised volumetric capacities. However, the volumetric capacity is a critical parameter to consider for vehicles such as trucks. The practical constraints under such circumstances are mainly linked to the tank volume required to accommodate Cites: Theoretical limits of hydrogen storage in metalorganic
