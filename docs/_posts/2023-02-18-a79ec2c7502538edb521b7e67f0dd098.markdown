Discovering entity mentions that are out of a Knowledge Base (KB) from texts plays a critical role in KB maintenance, but has not yet been fully explored. The current methods are mostly limited to the simple threshold-based approach and feature-based classification; the datasets for evaluation are relatively rare. In this work, we propose BLINKout, a new BERT-based Entity Linking (EL) method which can identify mentions that do not have a corresponding KB entity by matching them to a special Cites: EDIN: An End-to-end Benchmark and Pipeline for Unknown Entity
