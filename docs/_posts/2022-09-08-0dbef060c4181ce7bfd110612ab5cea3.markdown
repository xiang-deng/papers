Deep cross-modal hashing retrieval models inherit the vulnerability of deep neural networks. They are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially for the form of subtle perturbations to the inputs. Although many adversarial attack methods have been proposed to handle the robustness of hashing retrieval models, they still suffer from two problems: 1) Most of them are based on the white-box settings, which is usually unrealistic in practical application. 2) Iterative optimization for the generation of Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
