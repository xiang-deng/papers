The goal of natural language understanding (NLU) research is to build systems that can exhibit human-like intelligent behavior. Intelligent behavior in humans includes both learning and reasoning. With the dramatic success of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, researchers have created several state-of-the-art NLU applications that are purely based on learning with no, or shallow, reasoning capabilities. Also, machine learning-based NLU applications behave like a black-box, which means …
