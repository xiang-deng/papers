Transfer learning has significantly revolutionized modern machine learning systems by instilling the ability to use the knowledge gained from solving one problem for another. It has also helped to adapt and build models that can be generalized beyond the distributions that they are trained on. This dissertation explores and presents novel techniques for two transfer learning problems (cross-domain and cross-lingual) in the field of Natural Language Processing, for the tasks of text Cites: Adversarial examples for evaluating reading comprehension systems
