Code generation aims to generate a code snippet automatically from natural language descriptions. Generally, the mainstream code generation methods rely on a large amount of paired training data, including both the natural language description and the code. However, in some domain-specific scenarios, building such a large paired corpus for code generation is difficult because there is no directly available pairing data, and a lot of effort is required to manually write the code Cites: Coarse-to-fine decoding for neural semantic parsing
