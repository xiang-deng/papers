Event causality identification (ECI) aims to identify causal relations of event mention pairs in text. Despite achieving certain accomplishments, existing methods are still not effective due to the following two issues:(1) the lack of causal reasoning ability, imposing restrictions on recognizing implicit causal relations;(2) the significant gap between fine-tuning and pre-training, which hinders the utilization of pre-trained language models (PLMs). In this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge Enhanced …
