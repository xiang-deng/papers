Acquiring high-quality temporal common sense (TCS) knowledge from free-form text is a crucial but challenging problem for event-centric natural language understanding, due to the language reporting bias problem: people rarely report the commonly observed events but highlight the special cases. For example, one may rarely report I get up from bed in 1 minute, but we can observe It takes me an hour to get up from bed every morning in text. Models directly trained upon such corpus Cites: Conditional Generation of Temporally-ordered Event Sequences
