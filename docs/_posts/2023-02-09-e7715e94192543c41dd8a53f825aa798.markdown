Knowledge graph embedding has attracted widespread attention in recent years, and since knowledge graphs are dynamically updated in nature, the temporal information embedded is essential. Most of the knowledge graph embedding focuses on static KGs, while temporal knowledge graphs have been poorly studied. In the real-world, much structured knowledge is valid only within a specific temporality, ie, the development of facts follows a temporal order. Therefore, more and more  Cites: Question answering using enhanced lexical semantic models
