This paper proposes a deep neural network-based topology optimization acceleration method for irregular design domains that predicts (near-) optimal topologies. A topology optimization problem is a complex non-Euclidean data, which can be embedded in a graph form, and a graph neural network encodes it to Euclidean data such as vectors and matrices. The encoded information is applied to a multi-layer perceptron-based implicit neural representation model, and the multi Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
