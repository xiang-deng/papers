Not all building labels for training improve the performance of the deep learning model. Some labels can be falsely labeled or too ambiguous to represent their groundtruths, resulting in poor performance of the model. For example, building labels in OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Microsoft Building Footprints (MBF) are publicly available training sources that have great potential to train deep models, but directly using those labels for training can limit the model s performance as their labels are Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
