This paper provides a new approach combining BERT and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to solve a multi-label classification problem with limited training data. The paper introduces a method of using taxonomies and a dataset with 518 entries and 340 concepts to fine-tune BERT. It also introduces a new data augmentation technique called Perfect Binary Tree (PBT)-Flow to deal with limited or imbalanced training data. The proposed approach obtained a recall@ 10 of 61.12%, a precision@ 10 of …
