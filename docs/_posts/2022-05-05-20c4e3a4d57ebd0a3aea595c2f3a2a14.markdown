Although text-to-image synthesis has shown remarkable success in generating high- resolution photorealistic images and semantic consistency, it still faces challenges in generating images with complex backgrounds. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel generative adversarial text-to-image synthesis framework based on attention regularization modules and region proposal networks (ARRPNGAN).
