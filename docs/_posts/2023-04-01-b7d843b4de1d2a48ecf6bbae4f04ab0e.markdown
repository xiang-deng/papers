Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become effective learning techniques for many downstream network mining tasks including node and graph classification, link prediction, and network reconstruction. However, most GNN methods have been developed for homogeneous networks with only a single type of node and edge. In this work we present muxGNN, a multiplex graph neural network for heterogeneous graphs. To model heterogeneity, we represent graphs as multiplex networks  Cites: Adaptive Graph Encoder for Attributed Graph Embedding
