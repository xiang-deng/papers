The development of technological solutions satisfying nondiscriminatory requirements is one of the main current challenges for data processing. Back-end operators for preparing, ie, extracting and transforming, data play a relevant role wrt nondiscrimination, since they can introduce bias with an impact on the entire data life-cycle. In this paper, we focus on back-end transformations, defined in terms of Select-Project-Join queries, and on coverage. Coverage aims at guaranteeing that the …
