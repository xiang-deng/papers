ABSTRACT Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) introduced an approach to self- supervised learning avoiding the contrastive paradigm and subsequently removing the computational burden of negative sampling associated with such methods. However, we empirically find that the image representations produced under the BYOL s self-distillation paradigm are poorly distributed in representation space compared to contrastive methods. This work empirically demonstrates that feature Cites: Spherical Latent Spaces for Stable Variational Autoencoders
