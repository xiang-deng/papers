Impressive advances in acquisition and sharing technologies have made the growth of multimedia collections and their applications almost unlimited. However, the opposite is true for the availability of labeled data, which is needed for supervised training, since such data is often expensive and time-consuming to obtain. While there is a pressing need for the development of effective retrieval and classification methods, the difficulties faced by supervised approaches highlight the relevance of …
