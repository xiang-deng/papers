In order to secure software, it is critical to detect potential vulnerabilities. The performance of traditional static vulnerability detection methods is limited by predefined rules, which rely heavily on the expertise of developers. Existing deep learning-based vulnerability detection models usually use only a single sequence or graph embedding approach to extract vulnerability features. Sequence embedding-based models ignore the structured information inherent in the code, and graph …
