We present a new theoretical framework for making black box classifiers such as Neural Networks interpretable, basing our work on clear assumptions and guarantees. In our setting, which is inspired by the Merlin-Arthur protocol from Interactive Proof Systems, two functions cooperate to achieve a classification together: the\emph {prover} selects a small set of features as a certificate and presents it to the\emph {classifier}. Including a second, adversarial prover allows us  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
