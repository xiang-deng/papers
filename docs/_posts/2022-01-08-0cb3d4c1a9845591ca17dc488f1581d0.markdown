There have been lots of previous studies on disfluency detection. However, most of them focus on lexical cues, and little emphasis is placed on how diverse acoustic features contribute to improving the performance. We describe a framework for automatic fluency evaluation of spontaneous speech. We investigate not only lexical features extracted from transcription, but also consider time-sequential and static acoustic features from audio data, including energy and voicing-related features Cites: Disfluency detection using a bidirectional lstm
