Summary Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) is one of the vital components in keeping the global temperature rise within the 1.5 degrees Celsius target. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs are suitable locations for sequestering CO2 owing to their rock and structural properties and easy access to required infrastructure. Abandoned wells in these reservoirs can be used to inject CO2 saving both time and cost. Understanding the well integrity is important for CO2 containment and leakage  Cites: BoolQ: Exploring the surprising difficulty of natural yes/no questions
