Existing document-level neural machine translation (NMT) models have sufficiently explored different context settings to provide guidance for target generation. However, little attention is paid to inaugurate more diverse context for abundant context information. In this paper, we propose a Selective Memory-augmented Neural Document Translation model to deal with documents containing large hypothesis space of the context. Specifically, we retrieve similar bilingual sentence Cites: Search engine guided neural machine translation
