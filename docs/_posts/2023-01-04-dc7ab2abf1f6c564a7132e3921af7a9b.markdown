As a basic task of the intelligent education system, cognitive diagnosis aims to diagnose the knowledge proficiency of students and capture the complex relationship between students and exercises. Benefiting from big data, deep learning show advantages in cognitive diagnosis tasks. However, the general deep learning-based methods are sensitive to noise, and response bias is an inevitable problem in real-world situations. To address this challenge, we propose the Evidential Cognitive  Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
