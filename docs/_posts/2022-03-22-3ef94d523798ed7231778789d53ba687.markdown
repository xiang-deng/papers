In the field of autonomous driving and robotics, point clouds are showing their excellent real-time performance as raw data from most of the mainstream 3D sensors. Therefore, point cloud neural networks have become a popular research direction in recent years. So far, however, there has been little discussion about the explainability of deep neural networks for point clouds. In this paper, we propose a point cloud-applicable explainability approach based on a local surrogate model Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
