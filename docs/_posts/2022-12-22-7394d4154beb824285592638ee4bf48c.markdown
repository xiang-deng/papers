Identifying new problems and providing solutions are necessary tasks at early-stage product design and development for design engineers. A new problem fosters innovative and inventive solutions. Hence, it is expected that engineering design pedagogy and practice should equally focus on Engineering Design Problem-Exploring (EDPE)a process of identifying or coming up with a new problem or need at the early stage of design, and Engineering Design Problem-Solving (EDPS)a Cites: BERT has a mouth, and it must speak: BERT as a Markov random
