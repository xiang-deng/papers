Researchers have had much recent success with ranking models based on so-called learned sparse representations generated by transformers. One crucial advantage of this approach is that such models can exploit inverted indexes for top-k retrieval, thereby leveraging decades of work on efficient query evaluation. Yet, there remain many open questions about how these learned representations fit within the existing literature, which our work aims to tackle using four representative learned sparse …
