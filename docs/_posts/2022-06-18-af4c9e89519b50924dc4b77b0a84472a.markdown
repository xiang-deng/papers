Electric load forecasting is a crucial part of business operations in the energy industry. Various load forecasting methods and techniques have been proposed and tested. With growing concerns about cybersecurity and malicious data manipulations, an emerging topic is to develop robust load forecasting models. In this paper, we propose a robust support vector regression (SVR) model to forecast the electricity demand under data integrity attacks. We first introduce a weight Cites: Load forecasting using support vector machines: A study on
