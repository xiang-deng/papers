To extend the scope of coding queries to more realistic settings, we propose ODEX, the first open-domain execution-based natural language (NL) to code generation dataset. ODEX has 945 NL-Code pairs spanning 79 diverse libraries, along with 1,707 human-written test cases for execution. Our NL-Code pairs are harvested from StackOverflow forums to encourage natural and practical coding queries, which are then carefully rephrased to ensure intent clarity and prevent potential data Cites: Tranx: A transition-based neural abstract syntax parser for
