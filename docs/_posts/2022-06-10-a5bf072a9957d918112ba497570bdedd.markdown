This article presents a new design for autonomous artificial intelligence (AI), based on the state-of-the-art algorithms, and describes a new autonomous AI system called AutoAI . The methodology is used to assemble the design founded on self-improved algorithms that use new and emerging sources of data (NEFD). The objective of the article is to conceptualise the design of a novel AutoAI algorithm. The conceptual approach is used to advance into building new and improved algorithms.
