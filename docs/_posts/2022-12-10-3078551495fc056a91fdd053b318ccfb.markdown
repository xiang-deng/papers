Briefing: The rapid advancement of fundamental theories and computing capacity has brought artificial intelligence, internet of things, extended reality, and many other new intelligent technologies into our daily lives. Due to the lack of interpretability and reliability guarantees, it is extremely challenging to apply these technologies directly to real-world industrial systems. Here we present a new paradigm for establishing parallel factories in metaverses to accelerate the deployment of intelligent Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
