Compiler optimization passes are an important tool for improving program efficiency and reducing program size, but manually selecting optimization passes can be time-consuming and error-prone. While human experts have identified a few fixed sequences of optimization passes (eg, the Clang-Oz passes) that perform well for a wide variety of programs, these sequences are not conditioned on specific programs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that learns a policy to select passes for  Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
