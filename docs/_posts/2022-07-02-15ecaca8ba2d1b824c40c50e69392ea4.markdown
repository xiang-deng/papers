Autonomous driving research has progressed significantly in recent years. In order to travel safely, comfortably, and effectively, an autonomous car must completely comprehend the driving scenario at all times. The key criteria for a comprehensive understanding of the driving situations are proper perception and localization. The research on perception and localization of autonomous cars has increased substantially as a result of recent breakthroughs in AI, such as the wide range of  Cites: Espnet: Efficient spatial pyramid of dilated convolutions for
