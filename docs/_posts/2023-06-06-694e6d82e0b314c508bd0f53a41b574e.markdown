In this article we propose the first multi-task benchmark for evaluating the performances of machine learning models that work on low level assembly functions. While the use of multi-task benchmark is a standard in the natural language processing (NLP) field, such practice is unknown in the field of assembly language processing. However, in the latest years there has been a strong push in the use of deep neural networks architectures borrowed from NLP to solve problems on Cites: KILT: a benchmark for knowledge intensive language tasks
