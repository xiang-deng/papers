Abstract Existing Knowledge Graph (KG) models for commonsense question answering present two challenges:(i) existing methods retrieved entities related to questions from the knowledge graph, which may extract noise and irrelevant nodes, and (ii) lack of interaction representation between questions and graph entities. However, current methods mainly focus on retrieving relevant entities with some noisy and irrelevant nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel Retrieval-augmented  Cites: CommonsenseQA: A Question Answering Challenge Targeting
