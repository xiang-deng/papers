In this paper, we propose an evaluation of a Transformer-based punctuation restoration model for the Italian language. Experimenting with a BERT-base model, we perform several fine-tuning with different training data and sizes and tested them in an in-and cross-domain scenario. Moreover, we conducted an error analysis of the main weaknesses of the model related to specific punctuation marks. Finally, we test our system either quantitatively and qualitatively, by offering a typical task-oriented  Cites: Stanza: A python natural language processing toolkit for many
