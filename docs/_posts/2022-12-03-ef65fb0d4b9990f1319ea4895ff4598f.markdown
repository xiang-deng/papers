Data fusion enables the characterisation of an object using multiple datasets collected by various sensors. To improve optical coordinate measurement using data fusion, researchers have proposed numerous algorithmic solutions and methods. The most popular examples are the Gaussian process (GP) and weighted least-squares (WLS) algorithms, which depend on user-defined mathematical models describing the geometric characteristics of the measured object. Existing research on …
