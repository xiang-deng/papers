Defects innate in additively manufactured components may lead to inferior and more scatter in fatigue lives, thus challenging the qualification of these components in fatigue-critical applications. This work seeks to correlate geometrical features of critical defects measured from fracture surfaces to the fatigue performance of laser beam powder bed fusion (L-PBF) components with machine learning and to develop an integrated data-driven analytical framework for defect criticality (IDADC).
