Privacy auditing techniques for differentially private (DP) algorithms are useful for estimating the privacy loss to compare against analytical bounds, or empirically measure privacy in settings where known analytical bounds on the DP loss are not tight. However, existing privacy auditing techniques usually make strong assumptions on the adversary (eg, knowledge of intermediate model iterates or the training data distribution), are tailored to specific tasks and model architectures, and Cites: Large language models can be strong differentially private learners
