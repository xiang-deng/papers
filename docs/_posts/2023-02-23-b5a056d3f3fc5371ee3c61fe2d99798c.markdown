In this study, series networks (AlexNet and VGG-19) and directed acyclic graph (DAG) networks (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101) with transfer learning were employed to identify and classify 13 classes of apples from 7439 images. Two training datasets, model evaluation metrics, and three visualization methods were used to objectively assess, compare, and interpret five Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models. The results show that the dataset configuration had a …
