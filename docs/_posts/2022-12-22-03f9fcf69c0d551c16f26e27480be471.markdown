There are many types of approaches for Paraphrase Identification (PI), an NLP task of determining whether a sentence pair has equivalent semantics. Traditional approaches mainly consist of unsupervised learning and feature engineering, which are computationally inexpensive. However, their task performance is moderate nowadays. To seek a method that can preserve the low computational costs of traditional approaches but yield better task performance, we take an investigation …
