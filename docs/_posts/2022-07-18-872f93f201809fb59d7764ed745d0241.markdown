It is very challenging to accurately segment smoke images because smoke has some adverse properties, such as semi-transparency and blurry boundary. Aiming at solving these problems, we first fuse convolutional results along different axes to equivalently produce a cubic-cross convolutional kernel, which enlarges receptive fields at affordable computational costs for capturing long-range dependency of smoke pixels, and then we propose a Cubic-cross Convolutional Attention (CCA).
