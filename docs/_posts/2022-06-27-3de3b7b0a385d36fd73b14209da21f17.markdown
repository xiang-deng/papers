Abstract Knowledge Graph (KG) completion aims to find the missing entities or relationships in a knowledge graph. Although many approaches have been proposed to construct complete KGs, graph embedding methods have recently gained massive attention. These methods performed well in transductive settings, where the entire collection of entities must be known during training. However, it is still unclear how effectively the embedding methods capture the relational semantics
