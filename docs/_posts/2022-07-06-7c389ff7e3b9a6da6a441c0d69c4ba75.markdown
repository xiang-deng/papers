Many real-world problems, such as probabilistic reasoning, can be formulated as the task of counting the models of a propositional formula, called# SAT. A model of a formula is an assignment to its variables such that the formula evaluates to true. Related to model counting is model enumeration, or All-SAT, in which the models of a formula are recorded. It is applied, eg, in model checking and verification. Both# SAT and All-SAT are therefore of practical relevance.
