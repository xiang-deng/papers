Document-level relation extraction has multi-entity and multi-mention compared to sentence-level, existing sentence-level relation extraction models cannot meet the requirements of document-level relation extraction. Existing graph-based document-level models usually design points and edges manually, which often introduces man-made noise; while the Transformer-based models cannot deeply solve the difficulties such as coreference resolution by designing pre-training tasks or other methods.
