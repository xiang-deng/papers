Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an elegant approach to tackle sequential decision- making problems. In the standard setting, the task designer curates a reward function and the RL agent s objective is to take actions in the environment such that the long- term cumulative reward is maximized. Deep RL algorithms---that combine RL principles with deep neural networks---have been successfully used to learn behaviors in complex environments but are generally quite sensitive to the nature of Cites: Decoupling exploration and exploitation for meta-reinforcement
