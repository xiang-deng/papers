In this paper, a novel dual-channel system for multi-class text emotion recognition has been proposed, and a novel technique to explain its training & predictions has been developed. The architecture of the proposed system contains the embedding module, dual-channel module, emotion classification module, and explainability module. The embedding module extracts the textual features from the input sentences in the form of embedding vectors using the pre-trained Bidirectional Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
