How can we train an assistive human-machine interface (eg, an electromyography-based limb prosthesis) to translate a user s raw command signals into the actions of a robot or computer when there is no prior mapping, we cannot ask the user for supervision in the form of action labels or reward feedback, and we do not have prior knowledge of the tasks the user is trying to accomplish? The key idea in this paper is that, regardless of the task, when an interface is more intuitive, the user s commands  Cites: Learning adaptive language interfaces through decomposition
