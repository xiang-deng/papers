Data clustering is a commonly used data processing technique in many fields, which divides objects into different clusters in terms of some similarity measure between data points. Comparing to partitioning clustering methods which give a flat partition of the data, hierarchical clustering methods can give multiple consistent partitions of the data at different levels for the same data without rerunning clustering, it can be used to better analyze the complex structure of the data. There are usually two kinds of …
