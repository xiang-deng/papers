Segmentation of backscattered electron (BSE) images of cementitious materials is often used to quantify different microstructural features for the sake of performance estimation at macro-scale levels. However, the heterogeneous nature of cementitious matrices compounds with varying imaging conditions can lead the conventional segmentation methods to a processing bottleneck for largescale experiments. To overcome these challenges, in this study, we evaluate the potential …
