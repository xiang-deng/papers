Current approaches to implement eXplainable Autonomous Robots (XAR) are dominantly based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), which are suitable for modelling and correcting people s first-order mental state attributions to robots. Our recent findings show that people also rely on attributing second-order beliefs (ie, beliefs about beliefs) to robots to interpret their behavior. However, robots arguably form and act primarily on first-order beliefs and desires (about things in the environment) and …
