Existing dialog systems mainly build social bonds reactively with users for chitchat or assist users with specific tasks. In this work, we push forward to a promising yet under-explored proactive dialog paradigm called goal-directed dialog systems, where the goal refers to achieving the recommendation for a predetermined target topic through social conversations. We focus on how to make plans that naturally lead users to achieve the goal through smooth topic transitions. To this end, we Cites: Global-to-local memory pointer networks for task-oriented dialogue
