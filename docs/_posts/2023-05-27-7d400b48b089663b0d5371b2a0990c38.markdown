Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in utilizing external APIs as tools for various tasks. However, their tool-using ability is limited by the availability of suitable APIs and the instability of implicit reasoning, particularly when simultaneously engaging in reasoning about plans and actual calculations. To address these limitations, we propose CREATOR, a novel framework that empowers LLMs to create their own tools through documentation and code realization Cites: Tool Learning with Foundation Models
