Purpose Risk assessments have been constructed using a variety of algorithms, from bivariate associations, to regression, to advanced machine learning (ML) approaches. While promising greater accuracy, agencies are hesitant to adopt tools using newer ML approaches, noting concerns of bias and transparency. Research is needed to identify optimal scenarios for algorithm use in assessment development. Methods We compared regression models (logistic, boosted, and penalized) to more
