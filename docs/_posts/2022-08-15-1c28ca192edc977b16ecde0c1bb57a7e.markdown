Incremental event detection is a challenging subfield of event detection, which could be applied in various complex situations, especially for the real-time streaming data scenario where new event classes are continuously emerging. To handle the catastrophic forgetting problem, knowledge distillation has been proved to be a promising mechanism since it requires no extra tools or data storage. However, conventional knowledge distillation-based methods are not effective due to two Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
