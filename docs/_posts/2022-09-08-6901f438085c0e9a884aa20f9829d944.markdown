Depth estimation from stereo images is an important task in computer vision. Despite of the great contributions that are made in this field, most matchingbased methods still face the limitations brought by a presetfixed disparity range. Stereo matching is reconsidered using a specially designed dualmatching method with a crossattention mechanism, which liberates the algorithm from manually prespecified disparity ranges and the performance is guaranteed without retraining when the Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
