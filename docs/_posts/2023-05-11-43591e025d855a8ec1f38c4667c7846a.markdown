Even more so than natural language, code is extremely sensitive to syntax; a small error could make an entire snippet invalid. It is therefore important to explore methods for ensuring syntactic correctness in generated code. Existing methods to resolve this issue often rely on the complex architecture of syntax-guided decoders. In this work, we present the grammar enforcement method, which introduces a separate layer that constrains the decisions of the transformer during fine-tuning …
