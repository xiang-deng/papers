Learning a smooth graph signal from partially observed data is a well-studied task in graph-based machine learning. We consider this task from the perspective of optimal recovery, a mathematical framework for learning a function from observational data that adopts a worst-case perspective tied to model assumptions on the function to be learned. Earlier work in the optimal recovery literature has shown that minimizing a regularized objective produces optimal solutions for a general class of problems, but Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
