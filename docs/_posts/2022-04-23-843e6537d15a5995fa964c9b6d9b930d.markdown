The detection of novel foregrounds only utilizing scarce annotated images, namely few-shot object detection, makes a detector no longer dependent on large-scale instantiated sets. The realistic challenge might lie in establishing the correlation of few instances and balancing the sensitivity between base and novel categories. In this paper, we propose a few-shot detector using instance-level feature correlation based on an interactive self-attention module to deeply mine the discriminating Cites: Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database, 2009
