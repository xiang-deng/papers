In order to be used into a critical system, a software or an hardware component must come with strong evidences that the designer s intents have been correctly captured and implemented. This activity is already complex and expensive for classical systems despite a very large corpus of verification methods and tools. But it is even more complicated for systems embedding Machine Learning (ML) algorithms due to the very nature of the functions being implemented using ML and the very nature of  Cites: " Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any
