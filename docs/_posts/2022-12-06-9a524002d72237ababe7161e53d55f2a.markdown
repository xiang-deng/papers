Learning rich skills through temporal abstractions without supervision of external rewards is at the frontier of Reinforcement Learning research. Existing works mainly fall into two distinctive categories: variational and Laplacian-based option discovery. The former maximizes the diversity of the discovered options through a mutual information loss but overlooks coverage of the state space, while the latter focuses on improving the coverage of options by increasing connectivity during exploration  Cites: Explore, discover and learn: Unsupervised discovery of state
