This paper proposes a collaborative multi-agent system for splitting documents into semantically coherent text chunks, labeling them according to a given segmentation structure. Diverse linear text segmentation methods can be incorporated into the system by introducing new agents, which allows to combine complementary approaches: domain-specific, supervised and unsupervised. The system must be supplied with a representative set of previously segmented documents from the …
