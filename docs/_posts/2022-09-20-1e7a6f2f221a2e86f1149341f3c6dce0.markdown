The rapid development in knowledge graph (KG) technology and its popularity in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly increased the support for similar KG-based applications. However, there is a concerning problem regarding KGs; most of them are often incomplete. This motivated us to study knowledge graph completion (KGC). Some recent studies have used graph neural networks (GNN) such as graph convolutional networks (GCN) to model graph-structured data  Cites: SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings
