Context: Interpretation has been considered as a key factor to apply defect prediction in practice. As interpretation from rule-based interpretable models can provide insights about past defects with high quality, many prior studies attempt to construct interpretable models for both accurate prediction and comprehensible interpretation. However, class imbalance is usually ignored, which may bring huge negative impact on interpretation. Objective: In this paper, we are going to investigate resampling Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
