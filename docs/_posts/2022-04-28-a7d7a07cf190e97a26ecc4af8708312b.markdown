Anomaly detection of gas turbines is a typical binary classification problem under small sample size. In essence, the goal of classification is to discover the mapping that can map samples in different categories to disjoint codomains. The neural network has strong nonlinear mapping ability thus it has great potentialities in classification tasks. However, how to design the architecture of the neural network is still a challenging problem. The inappropriate network architecture might cause Cites: Regularizing and optimizing LSTM language models
