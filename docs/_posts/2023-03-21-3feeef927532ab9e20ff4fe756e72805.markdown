Disseminating and incorporating logic rules inspired by domain knowledge in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is desirable to make their output causally interpretable, reduce data dependence, and provide some human supervision during training to prevent undesirable outputs. Several methods have been proposed for that purpose but performing end-to-end training while keeping the DNNs informed about logical constraints remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel method to Cites: Revisiting the Importance of Encoding Logic Rules in Sentiment
