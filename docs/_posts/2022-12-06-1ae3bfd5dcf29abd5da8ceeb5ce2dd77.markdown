Increasingly complex learning methods such as boosting, bagging and deep learning have made ML models more accurate, but harder to interpret and explain, culminating in black-box machine learning models. Model developers and users alike are often presented with a trade-off between performance and intelligibility, especially in high-stakes applications like medicine. In the present article we propose a novel methodological approach for generating explanations for the  Cites: Intelligible and explainable machine learning: best practices and
