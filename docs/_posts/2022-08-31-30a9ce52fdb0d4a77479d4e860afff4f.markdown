Text classification is the most fundamental and foundational problem in many natural language processing applications. Recently, the graph-based model (eg, GNN-based model and GCN-based model) has been applied to this task and achieved excellent performance because of their superior capacity of modeling context from the global perspective. However, a multitude of existing graph-based models constructs a corpus-level graph structure which causes a high memory consumption Cites: Improved semantic representations from tree-structured long short
