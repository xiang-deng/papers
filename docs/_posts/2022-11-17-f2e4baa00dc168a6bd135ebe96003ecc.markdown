In spite of machine learning s rapid growth, its engineering support is scattered in many forms, and tends to favor certain engineering stages, stakeholders, and evaluation preferences. We envision a capability-based framework, which uses fine-grained specifications for ML model behaviors to unite existing efforts towards better ML engineering. We use concrete scenarios (model design, debugging, and maintenance) to articulate capabilities broad applications across various different Cites: Robustness Gym: Unifying the NLP Evaluation Landscape
