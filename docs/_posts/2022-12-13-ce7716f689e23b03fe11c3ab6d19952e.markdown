Over the years, Machine Learning models have been successfully employed on neuroimaging data for accurately predicting brain age. Deviations from the healthy brain aging pattern are associated to the accelerated brain aging and brain abnormalities. Hence, efficient and accurate diagnosis techniques are required for eliciting accurate brain age estimations. Several contributions have been reported in the past for this purpose, resorting to different data-driven modeling methods  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
