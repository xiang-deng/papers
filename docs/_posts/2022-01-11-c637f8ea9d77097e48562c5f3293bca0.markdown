This article is devoted to the intelligent optimization issue by means of PEO-FOCNN, ie, the fractional-order convolutional neural networks (FOCNNs) with population extremal optimization (PEO). The Caputo fractional-order gradient method (CFOGM) is adopted to improve the dynamic updating effectiveness of the biases and weights for convolutional neural networks (CNN). Moreover, considering the significance of the initial biases and weights and their updating mechanisms to the optimization Cites: Molecular geometry prediction using a deep generative graph
