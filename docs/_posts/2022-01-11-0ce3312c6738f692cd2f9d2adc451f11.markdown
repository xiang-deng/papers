We study the privacy implications of deploying recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in machine learning models. We focus on a class of privacy threats, called membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether or not specific data records have been used to train a model. Considering three machine learning applications, namely, machine translation, deep reinforcement learning, and image classification, we provide empirical evidence that RNNs are more vulnerable to MIAs than the Cites: Prediction with a short memory
