In modeling time series data, we often need to augment the existing data records to increase the modeling accuracy. In this work, we describe a number of techniques to extract dynamic information about the current state of a large scientific workflow, which could be generalized to other types of applications. The specific task to be modeled is the time needed for transferring a file from an experimental facility to a data center. The key idea of our approach is to find recent past data transfer events … Cites: ‪Input selection for fast feature engineering‬
