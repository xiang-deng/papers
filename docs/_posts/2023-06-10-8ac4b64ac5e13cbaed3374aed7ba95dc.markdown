Decision-making individuals are often considered to be either imitators who copy the action of their most successful neighbors or best-responders who maximize their benefit against the current actions of their neighbors. In the context of coordination games, where neighboring individuals earn more if they take the same action, by means of potential functions, it was shown that populations of all imitators and populations of all best-responders equilibrate in finite time when they become active …
