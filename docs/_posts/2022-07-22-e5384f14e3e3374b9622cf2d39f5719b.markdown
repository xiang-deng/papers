Feature attributions based on the Shapley value are popular for explaining machine learning models; however, their estimation is complex from both a theoretical and computational standpoint. We disentangle this complexity into two factors:(1)~ the approach to removing feature information, and (2)~ the tractable estimation strategy. These two factors provide a natural lens through which we can better understand and compare 24 distinct algorithms. Based on the various feature removal  Cites: " Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any
