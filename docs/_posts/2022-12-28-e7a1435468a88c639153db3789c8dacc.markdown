Instance segmentation is an important task for supporting robotic grasping in auto-store scenarios. Accurate segmentation usually relies on the quantity and quality of available annotated training data. However, it requires tremendous cost to obtain these labels. In this work, without requiring any human annotations on real data, our proposed self-ensembling sim-to-real network, namely SESR, is able to generate precise instance masks for a wide variety of supermarket goods. We design our Cites: Rethinking pre-training and self-training
