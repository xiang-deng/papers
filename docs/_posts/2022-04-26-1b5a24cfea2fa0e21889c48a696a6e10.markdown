To manage the rumors in social media to reduce the harm of rumors in society. Many studies used methods of deep learning to detect rumors in open networks. To comprehensively sort out the research status of rumor detection from multiple perspectives, this paper analyzes the highly focused work from three perspectives: Feature Selection, Model Structure, and Research Methods. From the perspective of feature selection, we divide methods into content feature, social feature, and Cites: Compare to The Knowledge: Graph Neural Fake News Detection
