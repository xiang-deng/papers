ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is one of the largest Large Language Models (LLM) with over 175 billion parameters. ChatGPT has demonstrated the impressive capabilities of LLM, particularly in the field of natural language processing (NLP). With the emergence of the discussion and application of LLM in various research or engineering domains, it is time to envision how LLM may revolutionize the way we approach intelligent transportation systems.
