Developing a universal model that can efficiently and effectively respond to a wide range of information access requests--from retrieval to recommendation to question answering--has been a long-lasting goal in the information retrieval community. This paper argues that the flexibility, efficiency, and effectiveness brought by the recent development in dense retrieval and approximate nearest neighbor search have smoothed the path towards achieving this goal. We develop a generic and extensible …
