Parallel neurosymbolic architectures have been applied effectively in NLP by distilling knowledge from a logic theory into a deep model. However, prior art faces several limitations including supporting restricted forms of logic theories and relying on the assumption of independence between the logic and the deep network. We present Concordia, a framework overcoming the limitations of prior art. Concordia is agnostic both to the deep network and the logic theory offering support for a wide  Cites: Towards neural theorem proving at scale
