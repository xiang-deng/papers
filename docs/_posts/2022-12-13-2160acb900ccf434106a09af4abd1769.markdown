Aspect-level sentiment classification (ASC) is designed to identify the sentiment orientation of given aspect terms in a sentence. Previous neural networks have used attention mechanisms to align context words with the appropriate aspect terms. Without considering syntactic dependencies, these models may erroneously focus on context words that are not related to the aspect terms. To address this issue, the graph convolution network (GCN) and the graph attention network (GAT) are …
