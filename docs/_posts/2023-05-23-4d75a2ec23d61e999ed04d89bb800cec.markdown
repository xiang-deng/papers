Text sentiment style transfer aims to extract the sentiment words from a sentence and transfer them into another expected sentiment style while retaining the original sentence s content. However, previous works have not achieved satisfactory performance on the text sentiment style transfer task, especially for non-parallel text. In this paper, a novel framework with the attention mechanism and embedding perturbed encoder is proposed to improve the performance of non-parallel text …
