Surrogates, models that mimic the behavior of programs, form the basis of a variety of programming techniques. We study three surrogate-based programming techniques, evaluating each in case studies on a large-scale CPU simulator. With surrogate compilation, programmers develop a surrogate that mimics the behavior of a program to deploy to end-users in place of the original program. Surrogate compilation accelerates the CPU simulator under study by 1.6. With surrogate Cites: Well-Read Students Learn Better: On the Importance of Pre
