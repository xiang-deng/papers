Lightweight semantic segmentation promotes the application of semantic segmentation in tiny devices. The existing lightweight semantic segmentation network has the problems of low precision and a large number of parameters. In response to the above problems, we designed a full 1D convolutional lightweight semantic segmentation network (LSNet). The tremendous success of this network is attributed to the following three modules: 1D multi-layer space module (1D-MS), 1D Cites: ESPNetv2: A Light-weight, Power Efficient, and General Purpose
