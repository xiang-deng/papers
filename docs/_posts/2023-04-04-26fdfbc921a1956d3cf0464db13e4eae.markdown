Abstract Dense Retriever (DR) for Open-domain textual question answering (OpenQA), which aims to retrieve passages from large data sources like Wikipedia or Google, has gained wide attention in recent years. Although DR models continuously refresh state-of-the-art performances, their improvement relies on negative sampling during the training process. Existing sampling strategies mainly focus on developing a complex algorithm based on computer science, and ignore the abundant semantic  Cites: Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering
