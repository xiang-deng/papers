While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are dominating the area of computer- aided 3D medical image diagnosis, they are incapable of capturing global information due to the intrinsic locality of convolution. Transformers, another type of neural network empowered with self-attention mechanism, are good at representing global relations, yet computationally expensive and do not generalize well on small datasets. Applying Transformers on 3D medical images has two major problems: 1) Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
