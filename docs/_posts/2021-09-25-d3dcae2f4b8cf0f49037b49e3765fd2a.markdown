Natural language inference (NLI) aims to determine the logical relationship between two sentences among the target labels Entailment, Contradiction, and Neutral. In recent years, deep learning models have become a prevailing approach to NLI, but they lack interpretability and explainability. In this work, we address the explainability for NLI by weakly supervised logical reasoning, and propose an Explainable Phrasal Reasoning (EPR) approach. Our model first detects phrases as the semantic unit and Cites: Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering
