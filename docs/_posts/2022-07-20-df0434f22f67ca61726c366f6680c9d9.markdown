Abstract Large Language Models (LMs) are expensive to operate. It would be more frugal to avoid querying them when results are predictably bad. In this paper we therefore investigate whether it is possible to granularly predict the performance of these large LMs with a much smaller external model, the assessor, which is trained on evaluation results. For instance, given an input prompt, can an assessor estimate the probability of correct completion by a giant like GPT-3 Davinci (175B Cites: On the opportunities and risks of foundation models
