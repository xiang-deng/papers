Graph Attention Network (GAT) focuses on modelling simple undirected and single relational graph data only. This limits its ability to deal with more general and complex multi-relational graphs that contain entities with directed links of different labels (eg, knowledge graphs). Therefore, directly applying GAT on multi-relational graphs leads to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle this issue, we propose r-GAT, a relational graph attention network to learn multi-channel entity representations Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
