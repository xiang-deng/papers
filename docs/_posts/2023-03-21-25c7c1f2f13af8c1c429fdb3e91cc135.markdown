Recent studies in few-shot event trigger detection from text address the task as a word sequence annotation task using prototypical networks. In this context, the classification of a word is based on the similarity of its representation to the prototypes built for each event type and for the “non-event” class (also named null class). However, the “non-event” prototype aggregates by definition a set of semantically heterogeneous words, which hurts the discrimination between trigger …
