We demonstrate EDA4Sum, a framework dedicated to generating guided multi-step data summarization pipelines for very large datasets. Data summarization is the process of producing interpretable and representative subsets of an input dataset. It is usually performed following a one-shot process with the purpose of finding the best summary. EDA4Sum leverages Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to produce connected summaries in multiple steps, with the goal of maximizing their cumulative  Cites: Constructing and exploring composite items
