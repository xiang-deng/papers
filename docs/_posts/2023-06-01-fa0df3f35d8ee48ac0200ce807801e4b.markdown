The Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) task involves retrieving and subsequently generating answers from fine-grained relevant passages within a database. Current systems leverage Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) to model the relationship between questions and passages. However, the diversity in surface form expressions can hinder the model s ability to capture accurate correlations, especially within complex contexts. Therefore, we utilize Abstract Meaning  Cites: Studying strategically: Learning to mask for closed-book QA
