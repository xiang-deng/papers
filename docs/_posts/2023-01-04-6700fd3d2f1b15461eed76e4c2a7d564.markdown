The analysis of software requirement specifications (SRS) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods has been an important study area in the software engineering field in recent years. Especially thanks to the advances brought by deep learning and transfer learning approaches in NLP, SRS data can be utilized for various learning tasks more easily. In this study, we employ a three-stage domain-adaptive fine-tuning approach for three prediction tasks regarding software …
