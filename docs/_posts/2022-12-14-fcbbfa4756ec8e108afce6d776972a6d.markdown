Abstract Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is a fundamental problem for temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), and TKGs embedding methods are one of the essential methods for KGC. However, existing TKG embedding methods encounter a scalability dilemma, ie, the inconsistency in parameter scalability doamong different datasets, and the less use of global information, eg, statistics and dependencies of facts. doTo mitigate these two issues, we propose a novel and  Cites: Complex embeddings for simple link prediction
