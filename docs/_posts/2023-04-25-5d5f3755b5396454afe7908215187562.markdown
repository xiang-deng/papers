In the taxonomic trace links concept, the source and target artifacts are connected through knowledge organization structure (eg, taxonomy). We introduce in this paper a recommender system that recommends labels to requirements artifacts from domain-specific taxonomy to establish taxonomic trace links. The tool exploits the hierarchical nature of taxonomies and uses requirements text and context information as input to the recommender.
