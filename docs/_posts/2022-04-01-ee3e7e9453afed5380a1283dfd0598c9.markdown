The emerging field of precision medicine is transforming statistical analysis from the classical paradigm of population-average treatment effects into that of personal treatment effects. This new scientific mission has called for adequate statistical methods to assess heterogeneous covariate effects in regression analysis. This paper focuses on a subgroup analysis that consists of two primary analytic tasks: identification of treatment effect subgroups and individual group memberships, and Cites: Spectral methods meet EM: A provably optimal algorithm for
