We provide a novel first-order optimization algorithm for bilinearly-coupled strongly-convex-concave minimax optimization called the AcceleratedGradient OptimisticGradient (AG-OG). The main idea of our algorithm is to leverage the structure of the considered minimax problem and operates Nesterov s acceleration on the individual part and optimistic gradient on the coupling part of the objective. We motivate our method by showing that its continuous-time dynamics corresponds to an …
