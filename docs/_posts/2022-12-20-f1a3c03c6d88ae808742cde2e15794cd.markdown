Deep question generation (DQG) refers to generating a complex question from different sentences in context. Existing methods mainly focus on enhancing information extraction based on the encoder–decoder neural networks though they cannot perform well in DQG tasks. To address this issue, we consider combining reinforcement learning with semantic-rich information to generate deep questions in this paper. In particular, we propose a Semantic-Rich Reinforcement Learning Deep …
