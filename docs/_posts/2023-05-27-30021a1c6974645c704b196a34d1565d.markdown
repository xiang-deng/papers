The performance of current supervised AI systems is tightly connected to the availability of annotated datasets. Annotations are usually collected through annotation tools, which are often designed for specific tasks and are difficult to customize. Moreover, existing annotation tools with an active learning mechanism often only support limited use cases. To address these limitations, we present EASE, an Easily-Customized Annotation System Powered by Efficiency Enhancement Cites: Easy, Reproducible and Quality-Controlled Data Collection with
