For Named Entity Recognition (NER), sequence labeling-based and span-based paradigms are quite different. Previous research has demonstrated that the two paradigms have clear complementary advantages, but few models have attempted to leverage these advantages in a single NER model as far as we know. In our previous work, we proposed a paradigm known as Bundling Learning (BL) to address the above problem. The BL paradigm bundles the two NER paradigms, enabling NER …
