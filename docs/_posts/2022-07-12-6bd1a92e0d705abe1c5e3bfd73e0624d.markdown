In the context of big data, faster and more accurate methods are required for RDF data retrieval. The current research on querying RDF graph data has made some progress, but it has a certain delay and high up-front cost. Given the above shortcomings, we propose a more efficient framework for querying RDF graph data based on the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) approach. Firstly, we annotate the evolution process of data content and association and then construct the evolution update …
