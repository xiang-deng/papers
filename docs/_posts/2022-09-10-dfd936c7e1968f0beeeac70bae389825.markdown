A method for hypergraph-based analysis and the design of manufacturing systems has been developed. The reason for its development is the need to integrate the human workforce into Industry 4.0 solutions. The proposed intelligent collaborative manufacturing space enhances collaboration between the operators as well as provides them with valuable information about their performance and the state of the production system. The design of these Operator 4.0 solutions requires a problem  Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
