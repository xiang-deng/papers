Embeddings, low-dimensional vector representation of objects, are fundamental in building modern machine learning systems. In industrial settings, there is usually an embedding team that trains an embedding model to solve intended tasks (eg, product recommendation). The produced embeddings are then widely consumed by consumer teams to solve their unintended tasks (eg, fraud detection). However, as the embedding model gets updated and retrained to improve performance on the …
