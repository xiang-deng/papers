Pre-trained giant code models (PCMs) start coming into the developers daily practices. Understanding what types of and how much software knowledge is packed into PCMs is the foundation for incorporating PCMs into software engineering (SE) tasks and fully releasing their potential. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on the SE factual knowledge in the state-of-the-art PCM CoPilot, focusing on APIs Fully Qualified Names (FQNs), the fundamental knowledge for effective code Cites: Emergent abilities of large language models
