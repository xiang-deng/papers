In this thesis, we consider the task of data-to-text generation, which takes non- linguistic structures as input and produces textual output. The inputs can take the form of database tables, spreadsheets, charts, and so on. The main application of data-to-text generation is to present information in a textual format which makes it accessible to a layperson who may otherwise find it problematic to understand numerical figures. The task can also automate routine document generation jobs Cites: Data-to-text Generation with Variational Sequential Planning
