A key promise of machine learning is the ability to assist users with personal tasks. Because the personal context required to make accurate predictions is often sensitive, we require systems that protect privacy. A gold standard privacy-preserving system will satisfy perfect secrecy, meaning that interactions with the system provably reveal no additional private information to adversaries. This guarantee should hold even as we perform multiple personal tasks over the same underlying data  Cites: Few-Shot Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning is Better and Cheaper
