Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) plays a vital role in plant disease resistance and also induces the expression of disease resistance genes in plants. In this study, a transcriptome analysis was performed on grapevine leaves after 12, 24 and 48 h of MeJA-100 μM treatment. A total of 1242 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from the transcriptome data, and the analysis of the DEGs showed that genes related to phytohormone signal transduction, jasmonic acid-mediated …
