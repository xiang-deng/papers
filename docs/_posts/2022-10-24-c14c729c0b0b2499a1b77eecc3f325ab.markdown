While interacting with chatbots, users may elicit multiple intents in a single dialogue utterance. Instead of training a dedicated multi-intent detection model, we propose DialogUSR, a dialogue utterance splitting and reformulation task that first splits multi-intent user query into several single-intent sub-queries and then recovers all the coreferred and omitted information in the sub-queries. DialogUSR can serve as a plug-in and domain-agnostic module that empowers the multi-intent detection for the  Cites: Can you unpack that? learning to rewrite questions-in-context
