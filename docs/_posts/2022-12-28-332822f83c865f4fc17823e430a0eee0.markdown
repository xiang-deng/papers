This paper presents an augmented reality application to assist with myoelectric prostheses control for people with limb amputations. For that, we use the low-cost Myo armband coupled with low-level signal processing methods specifically built to control filters  levels and processing chain. In particular, we use deep learning techniques to process the signals and to accurately identify seven different hand gestures. From that, we have built an augmented reality projection of a hand based …
