Drawing the strengths of data science and machine learning, process mining has recently emerged as an effective research approach for process management and its decision support. Bottleneck identification and analysis is a key problem in process mining which is considered a critical component for process improvement. While previous studies focusing on bottlenecks have been reported, visible gaps remain. Most of these studies considered bottleneck identification from local perspectives by …
