In computer vision, the task of semantic segmentation is to segment images for the distinguish of different objects. Identifying objects in different images is very useful in many applications, eg, scene understanding, medical image analysis, robot perception and satellite image segmentation. Although important progress has been made in this field, these works have not been fully summarized. This paper investigates the extensive research work of semantic segmentation methods based Cites: Espnet: Efficient spatial pyramid of dilated convolutions for
