We used survival analysis to quantify the impact of postdischarge evaluation and management (E/M) services in preventing hospital readmission or death. Our approach avoids a specific pitfall of applying machine learning to this problem, which is an inflated estimate of the effect of interventions, due to survivors bias--where the magnitude of inflation may be conditional on heterogeneous confounders in the population. This bias arises simply because in order to receive an intervention after Cites: Do feature attribution methods correctly attribute features?
