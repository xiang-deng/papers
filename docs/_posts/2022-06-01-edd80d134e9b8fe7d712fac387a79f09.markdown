Deep learning (DL) is a hot topic in machine learning (ML). To limit the amount of time and money spent on supervised machine learning, we use DL. With a variety of methodologies and topographies, DL may be applied to address complicated problems in a variety of contexts. Features that illustrate or differentiate are learned in a layered manner. When it comes to effective security solutions, DL has made significant strides in a wide number of application domains.
