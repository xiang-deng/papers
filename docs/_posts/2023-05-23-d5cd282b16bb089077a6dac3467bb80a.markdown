Class-Incremental Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition (CIFNER) aims to identify entity categories that have appeared with only a few newly added (novel) class examples. However, existing class-incremental methods typically introduce new parameters to adapt to new classes and treat all information equally, resulting in poor generalization. Meanwhile, few-shot methods necessitate samples for all observed classes, making them difficult to transfer into a class-incremental setting. Thus, a …
