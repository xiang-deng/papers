Multi-temporal deep learning approaches can make full use of crop growth patterns and phenological characteristics, resulting in excellent crop classification performance in large areas. However, obtaining complete time-series remote sensing images during the growing season is challenging due to cloud contamination. Hence, given time-series multispectral data, it is important to impute missing data and accurately classify crops. A novel Imputation-BiLSTM model (Im Cites: Recurrent neural networks for multivariate time series with missing
