Many complex problems are naturally understood in terms of symbolic concepts. For example, our concept of cat is related to our concepts of ears and whiskers in a non-arbitrary way. Fodor (1998) proposes one theory of concepts, which emphasizes symbolic representations related via constituency structures. Whether neural networks are consistent with such a theory is open for debate. We propose unit tests for evaluating whether a system s behavior is consistent with several key aspects of Cites: Provable Limitations of Acquiring Meaning from Ungrounded Form
