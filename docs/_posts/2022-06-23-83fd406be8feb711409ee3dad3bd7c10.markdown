In this survey, we examine Knowledge Graph mining algorithms, methods, and techniques and analyze them based on their capability to process heterogeneous knowledge graphs. First, we start with traditional graph analytics, including similarity and proximity metrics. Then we discuss the latest in deep and representation learning algorithms and methods. Following, we describe an experiment highlighting the applications of Knowledge Graph Mining in drug discovery. Finally, we reflect on
