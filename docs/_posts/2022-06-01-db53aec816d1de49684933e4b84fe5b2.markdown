With the increasing installed capacity of photovoltaic (PV) power generation, it has become a significant challenge to detect abnormalities and faults of PV modules in a timely manner. Considering that all the fault information of the PV module is contained in the current-voltage (IV) curve, this pioneering study takes the IV curve as the input and proposes a PV-fault identification method based on improved deep residual shrinkage networks (DRSN). This method can not only identify single faults … Cites: ‪Empirical evaluation of gated recurrent neural networks on …‬
