Joint entity and relation extraction is a fundamental and important task in the process of building knowledge graphs. At present, many researchers have proposed their own methods to solve this task, but these studies often have some limitations, such as irrelevant relation prediction, and lack of information interaction between the relation and entity. The complex model structure leads to inefficiency and does not make good use of the associations between the various subtasks. We propose a …
