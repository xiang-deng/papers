Knowledge base with multiple hops quizzing aims to discover the subject entity in a question at a distance from the knowledge base s answer entity for multiple hops. The lack of supervised signals for the intermediate phases of multi-hop inference, which leaves a model only able to get input on the final output, is a significant difficulty for the study, where the inference instructions for the intermediate steps cannot be effectively optimized and the forward propagation of inference states is …
