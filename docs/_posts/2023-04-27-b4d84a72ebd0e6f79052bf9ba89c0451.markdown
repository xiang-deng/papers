Code comment generation aims at generating natural language descriptions for a code snippet to facilitate developers program comprehension activities. Despite being studied for a long time, a bottleneck for existing approaches is that given a code snippet, they can only generate one comment while developers usually need to know information from diverse perspectives such as what is the functionality of this code snippet and how to use it. To tackle this limitation, this study empirically Cites: Rethinking the Role of Demonstrations: What Makes In-Context
