In this paper we revisit automatic metrics for paraphrase evaluation and obtain two findings that disobey conventional wisdom:(1) Reference-free metrics achieve better performance than their reference-based counterparts.(2) Most commonly used metrics do not align well with human annotation. Underlying reasons behind the above findings are explored through additional experiments and in-depth analyses. Based on the experiments and analyses, we propose ParaScore, a new evaluation Cites: Neural Syntactic Preordering for Controlled Paraphrase Generation
