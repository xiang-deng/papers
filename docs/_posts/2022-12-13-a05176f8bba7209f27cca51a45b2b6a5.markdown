This paper provides the first broad overview of the relation between different interpretation methods and human eye-movement behaviour across different tasks and architectures. The interpretation methods of neural networks provide the information the machine considers important, while the human eye-gaze has been believed to be a proxy of the human cognitive process. Thus, comparing them explains machine behaviour in terms of human behaviour, leading to improvement in  Cites: Pathologies of neural models make interpretations difficult
