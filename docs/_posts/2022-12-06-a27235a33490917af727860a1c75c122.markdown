Information retrieval aims to find information that meets users  needs from the corpus. Different needs correspond to different IR tasks such as document retrieval, open-domain question answering, retrieval-based dialogue, etc., while they share the same schema to estimate the relationship between texts. It indicates that a good IR model can generalize to different tasks and domains. However, previous studies indicate that state-of-the-art neural information retrieval (NIR) models, eg, pre-trained …
