With a fast developing pace of geographic applications, automatable and intelligent models are essential to be designed to handle the large volume of information. However, few researchers focus on geographic natural language processing, and there has never been a benchmark to build a unified standard. In this work, we propose a GeoGraphic Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark, named GeoGLUE. We collect data from open-released geographic resources and introduce …
