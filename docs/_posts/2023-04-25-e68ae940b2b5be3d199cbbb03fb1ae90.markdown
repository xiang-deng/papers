We demonstrate Rapsai, a visual programming platform that aims to streamline the rapid and iterative development of end-to-end machine learning (ML)-based multimedia applications. Rapsai features a node-graph editor that enables interactive characterization and visualization of ML model performance, which facilitates the understanding of how the model behaves in different scenarios. Moreover, the platform streamlines end-to-end prototyping by providing interactive Cites: AI Chains: Transparent and Controllable Human-AI Interaction by
