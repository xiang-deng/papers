We propose a general method to construct centroid approximation for the distribution of maximum points of a random function (aka argmax distribution), which finds broad applications in machine learning. Our method optimizes a set of centroid points to compactly approximate the argmax distribution with a simple objective function, without explicitly drawing exact samples from the argmax distribution. Theoretically, the argmax centroid method can be shown to minimize a surrogate of Wasserstein Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
