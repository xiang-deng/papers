In recent times, edge computing offers new solutions to support intelligent decision making for better allocation of the resources. However, most of the distributed computing services fails in overcoming the bottleneck of the network in the form of complex memory computation and communication cost between the edge devices/edge nodes/cloud centers. To mitigate such challenges, it is essential to distribute the workload such that the issues associated with complex memory Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
