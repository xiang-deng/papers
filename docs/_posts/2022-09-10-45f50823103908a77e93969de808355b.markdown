Domain Generalization (DG) studies the capability of a deep learning model to generalize to out-of-training distributions. In the last decade, literature has been massively filled with a collection of training methodologies that claim to obtain more abstract and robust data representations to tackle domain shifts. Recent research has provided a reproducible benchmark for DG, pointing out the effectiveness of naive empirical risk minimization (ERM) over existing algorithms.
