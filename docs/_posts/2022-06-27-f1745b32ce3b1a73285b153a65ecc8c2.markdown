This paper aims to review the state-of-the-art statistical relational learning models (SRL) in genomics. SRL deals with machine learning and data mining in relational domains where observations may be missing, partially observed, and noisy. This chapter introduces a background overview of various models, including probabilistic graphical models, Bayesian networks, dependency networks, Markov networks, first-order logic, and probabilistic inductive logic programming. This chapter also …
