In this chapter, a brief history of QA systems will be introduced. In addition, different components of a QA system will be described in detail. Components of the QA architectures which are related to the main focus of this book will be outlined, and the main QA models in these architectures will be determined. We are going to cover history and architecture for each of the TextQA, KBQA, as well as hybrid systems separately. Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
