In modern biomedicine, the role of computation becomes more crucial in light of the ever-increasing growth of biological data, which requires effective computational methods to integrate them in a meaningful way and unveil previously undiscovered biological insights. In this dissertation, we introduce a series of machine learning algorithms for biomedical discovery. Focused on protein functions in the context of system biology, these machine learning algorithms learn representations of protein Cites: Progen: Language modeling for protein generation
