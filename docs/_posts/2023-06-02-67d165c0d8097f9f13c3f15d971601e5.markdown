Current LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing users  requests for various types of information. However, these models are limited by the most recent data available in their pretraining corpora, rendering them incapable of providing up-to-date information. Retraining LLMs from scratch is cost-prohibitive, and the effectiveness of continual fine-tuning on new corpora has not been thoroughly examined. Additionally, current update procedures typically demand …
