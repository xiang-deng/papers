Static word embeddings (SWE) and contextualized word embeddings (CWE) are the foundation of modern natural language processing. However, these embeddings suffer from spatial bias in the form of anisotropy, which has been demonstrated to reduce their performance. A method to alleviate the anisotropy is the “whitening” transformation. Whitening is a standard method in signal processing and other areas, however, its effect on SWE and CWE is not well understood. In this study, we conduct …
