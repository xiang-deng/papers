The prevalent heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) models learn node and graph representations using pre-defined meta-paths or only automatically discovering meta-paths. However, the existing methods suffer from information loss due to neglecting undiscovered meta-structures with richer semantics than meta-paths in heterogeneous graphs. To take advantage of the current rich meta-structures in heterogeneous graphs, we propose a novel approach called HeGTM to  Cites: Introduction to Graph Neural Networks
