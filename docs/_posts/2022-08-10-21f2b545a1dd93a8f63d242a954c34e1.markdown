We propose a new general Graph Adversarial Domain Adaptation (GADA) based on semantic knowledge reasoning of class structure for solving the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from the big data with non-shared and imbalanced classes to specified small and imbalanced applications (NI-UDA), where non-shared classes mean the label space out of the target domain. Our goal is to leverage priori hierarchy knowledge to enhance domain adversarial aligned feature Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
