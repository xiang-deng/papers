We propose LogSummary, an automatic, unsupervised end-to-end log summarization framework for software system maintenance in this work. LogSummary obtains the summarized triples of necessary logs for a given log sequence. It integrates a novel information extraction method that considers semantic information and domain knowledge with a new triple-ranking approach using the global knowledge learned from all logs.
