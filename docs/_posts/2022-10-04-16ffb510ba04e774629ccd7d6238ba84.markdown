[Objective] This paper proposes a new model to improve the traditional text classifiers which tend to misclassify commodity titles with different labels and similar modifiers.[Methods] First, we designed the text discriminator as an auxiliary task, which took the normalized Euclidean distance of different label text vectors as the loss function. Then, we utilized the cross-entropy loss function of the traditional text classification to the new text encoder. Finally, we generated text representation with  Cites: Document modeling with gated recurrent neural network for
