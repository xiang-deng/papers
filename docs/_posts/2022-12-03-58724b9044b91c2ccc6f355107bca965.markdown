Abstract We propose KNN-Kmeans MT, a sample efficient algorithm that improves retrieval based augmentation performance in low resource settings by adding an additional K-means filtering layer after the KNN step. KNN-Kmeans MT like its predecessor retrieval augmented machine translation approaches (Khandelwal et al.[2020]) doesn t require any additional training and outperforms the existing methods in low resource settings. The additional K-means step makes the model  Cites: REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training
