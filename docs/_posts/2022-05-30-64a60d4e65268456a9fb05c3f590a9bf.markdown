With the growing number of new benchmarks, we build bigger and more complex LMs. However, building new LMs may not be an ideal option owing to the cost, time and environmental impact associated with it. We explore an alternative route: can we modify data by expressing it in terms of the model s strengths, so that a question becomes easier for models to  Cites: BoolQ: Exploring the surprising difficulty of natural yes/no questions
