Dynamically typed languages such as Python have become very popular. Among other strengths, Python s dynamic nature and its straightforward linking to native code have made it the de-facto language for many research areas such as Artificial Intelligence. This flexibility, however, makes static analysis very hard. While creating a sound, or a soundy, analysis for Python remains an open problem, we present in this work Serenity, a framework for static analysis of Python that turns out to be Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
