Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims at determining the sentiment polarity of the given aspect term in a sentence. Recently, graph convolution network (GCN) has been used in the ABSA task and obtained promising results. Despite the proliferation of the methods and their success, prevailing models based on GCN lack a powerful constraint mechanism for the message passing to aspect terms, introducing heavy noise during graph convolution. Further, they simply average the … Cites: ‪Adaptive recursive neural network for target-dependent twitter …‬
