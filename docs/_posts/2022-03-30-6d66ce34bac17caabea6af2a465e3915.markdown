This thesis by articles makes several contributions to the field of machine learning, specifically, in graph reasoning tasks. Each article investigates and improves generalization in one of several graph reasoning applications: classical graph classification tasks, compositional visual reasoning, and the novel task of parameter prediction for neural network graphs. In the first article we study the attention mechanism in graph neural networks (GNNs). While attention has been widely Cites: Neural motifs: Scene graph parsing with global context
