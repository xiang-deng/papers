In this paper, we propose a new method for knowledge base completion (KBC): instance-based learning (IBL). For example, to answer (Jill Biden, lived city,?), instead of going directly to Washington DC, our goal is to find Joe Biden, who has the same lived city as Jill Biden. Through prototype entities, IBL provides interpretability. We develop theories for modeling prototypes and combining IBL with translational models. Experiments on various tasks confirmed the IBL model s effectiveness and  Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
