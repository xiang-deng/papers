We study the knowledge extrapolation problem to embed new components (ie, entities and relations) that come with emerging knowledge graphs (KGs) in the federated setting. In this problem, a model trained on an existing KG needs to embed an emerging KG with unseen entities and relations. To solve this problem, we introduce the meta-learning setting, where a set of tasks are sampled on the existing KG to mimic the link prediction task on the emerging KG. Based on sampled tasks Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
