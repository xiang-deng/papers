Graph-based semi-supervised learning methods have been used in a wide range of real-world applications. However, existing methods limited along with high computational complexity or not facilitating incremental learning, which may not be powerful to deal with large-scale data, whose scale may continuously increase, in real world. This paper proposes a new method called Data Distribution Based Graph Learning (DDGL) for semi-supervised learning on large-scale data. This method can Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
