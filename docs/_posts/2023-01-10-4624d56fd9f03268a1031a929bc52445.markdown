Constraint programming is known for being an efficient approach for solving combinatorial problems. Important design choices in a solver are the branching heuristics, which are designed to lead the search to the best solutions in a minimum amount of time. However, developing these heuristics is a time-consuming process that requires problem-specific expertise. This observation has motivated many efforts to use machine learning to automatically learn efficient heuristics without expert Cites: Keeping your distance: Solving sparse reward tasks using self
