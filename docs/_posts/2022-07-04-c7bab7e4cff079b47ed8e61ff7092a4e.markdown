Semantic segmentation is a promising machine learning (ML) method for highly precise fine-scale defect detection and part qualification in additive manufacturing (AM). Most existing segmentation methods utilize convolutional neural network architectures that require large quantities of training data. However, obtaining sufficient data—both in quality and quantity—to train such models is expensive and time-consuming for individual AM practitioners, which severely limits the deployment …
