The ever-growing model size and scale of compute have attracted increasing interests in training deep learning models over multiple nodes. However, when it comes to training on cloud clusters, especially across remote clusters, huge challenges are faced. In this work, we introduce a general framework, Nebula-I, for collaboratively training deep learning models over remote heterogeneous clusters, the connections between which are low-bandwidth wide area networks (WANs).
