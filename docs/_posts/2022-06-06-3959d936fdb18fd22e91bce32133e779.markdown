Identifying the determinants of metro ridership is essential for metro planning and passenger flow management. However, few studies to date have empirically examined how accessibility affects metro ridership and even fewer have emphasized the non-linear impacts from a spatiotemporal perspective. This study demarcates station areas via the network-distance method and precisely quantifies the accessibility of metro stations both internally and externally.
