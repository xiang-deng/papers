Most real-world networks suffer from incompleteness or incorrectness, which is an inherent attribute to real-world datasets. As a consequence, those downstream machine learning tasks in complex network like community detection methods may yield less satisfactory results, ie, a proper preprocessing measure is required here. To address this issue, in this paper, we design a new community attribute based link prediction strategy HAP and propose a two-step community enhancement algorithm Cites: Link-prediction enhanced consensus clustering for complex networks
