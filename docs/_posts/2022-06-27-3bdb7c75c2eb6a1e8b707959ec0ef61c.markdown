One of the major open problems in sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is the scarcity of labeled data. Among the many solutions to address this challenge, semi-supervised learning approaches represent a promising direction. However, their centralized architecture incurs in the scalability and privacy problems that arise when the process involves a large number of users. Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to address these problems. However, the FL methods that have …
