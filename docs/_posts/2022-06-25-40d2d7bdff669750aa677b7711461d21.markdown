DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) have a significant impact on many life activities, so identification of DBPs is a crucial issue. And it is greatly helpful to understand the mechanism of protein-DNA interactions. In traditional experimental methods, it is significant time-consuming and labor-consuming to identify DBPs. In recent years, many researchers have proposed lots of different DBP identification methods based on machine learning algorithm to overcome shortcomings mentioned above …
