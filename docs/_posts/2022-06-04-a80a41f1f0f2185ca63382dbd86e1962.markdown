Abstract Machine learning has advanced dramatically, narrowing the accuracy gap to humans in multimodal tasks like visual question answering (VQA). However, while humans can say “I don t know” when they are uncertain (ie, abstain from answering a question), such ability has been largely neglected in multimodal research, despite the importance of this problem to the usage of VQA in real settings. In this work, we promote a problem formulation for reliable VQA, where we prefer abstention over … Cites: ‪Confidence modeling for neural semantic parsing‬
