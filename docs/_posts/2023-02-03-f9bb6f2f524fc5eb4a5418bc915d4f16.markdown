Graph neural architecture search (NAS) has gained great popularity in automatically designing powerful graph neural networks (GNNs) with superior learning abilities, significantly relieving human effort and expertise reliance. Despite the advanced performance of automated learning, existing graph NAS models mainly work on single-relational graphs, while the widespread multi-relational graphs in real-world applications, are not well addressed. Moreover, current search spaces of automated …
