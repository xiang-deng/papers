Learning sentence representations is an essential and challenging topic in the deep learning and natural language processing communities. Recent methods pre-train big models on a massive text corpus, focusing mainly on learning the representation of contextualized words. As a result, these models cannot generate informative sentence embeddings since they do not explicitly exploit the structure and discourse relationships existing in contiguous sentences.
