Bug datasets lay significant empirical and experimental foundation for various SE/PL researches such as fault localization, software testing, and program repair. Current well-known datasets are constructed manually, which inevitably limits their scalability, representativeness, and the support for the emerging data-driven research. In this work, we propose an approach to automate the process of harvesting replicable regression bugs from the code evolution history. We focus on  Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
