The easy-to-use attention monitoring systems usually detect the participant s attentional status via processing electroencephalogram (EEG) data recorded from a single FPz channel. But due to the influence of noises and artifacts, the attention-monitoring performance needs to be further improved to suit different individuals and devices. This paper compared the attention-related features extracted using four state-of-the-art methods including delta/beta1 (D/B1), + + + + R, entropy and Cites: Measuring the usefulness of hidden units in Boltzmann machines
