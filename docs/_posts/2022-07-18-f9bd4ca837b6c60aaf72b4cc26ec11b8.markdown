We propose a system that uses semantic object detections to localize a microgravity free-flyer. Many applications require absolute localization in a known reference frame, such as the execution of waypoint trajectories defined by human operators. Classical geometric methods build a map of point features, which may not be able to be associated after lighting or environmental changes. By contrast, semantics remain invariant to changes up to the robustness of the detection algorithm and motion of the Cites: Randaugment: Practical automated data augmentation with a
