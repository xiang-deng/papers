Sentence reconstruction and generation are essential applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Early studies were based on classic methods such as production rules and statistical models. Recently, the prevailing models typically use deep neural networks. In this study, we utilize deep neural networks to develop a model capable of generating new and unseen sentences or reconstructing the given input with minor changes. To achieve this goal, we develop an unsupervised tree …
