Symbolic based logic reasoning is always an important service for correctness sensitive applications built on knowledge graphs. To make reasoning efficient in practice, current research focuses on designing parallel reasoning algorithms or employing high-performance computing architectures, like neural networks. No matter what architecture we choose, the computational complexity of reasoning is upper-bounded by the PTime-completeness or higher ones that are not parallelly …
