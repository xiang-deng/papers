Recall one time when we were in an unfamiliar mall. We might mistakenly think that there exists or does not exist a piece of glass in front of us. Such mistakes will remind us to walk more safely and freely at the same or a similar place next time. To absorb the human mistake correction wisdom, we propose a novel glass segmentation network to detect transparent glass, dubbed GlassSegNet. Motivated by this human behavior, GlassSegNet utilizes two key stages: the identification stage (IS) and the  Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
