Although deep learning has shown good performance in many fields, it still lacks the most basic human intelligence, which we often called the ability to draw inferences about other cases from one instance. Therefore, how to empower model with logical reasoning ability has received much attention. Thus, we propose neural predicate networks, a model that combines deep learning methods with first-order logic. It converts visual tasks into first-order logic problems by deconstructing them into Cites: Compositional attention networks for machine reasoning
