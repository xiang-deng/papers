Attribute Controlled Text Rewriting, also known as text style transfer, has received significant attention in the natural language generation community due to its crucial role in controllable natural language generation systems. In this work we present SimpleStyle a minimalist yet effective approach for attribute controlled text rewriting based on a simple mechanism composed of two ingredients. controlled denoising and output filtering. Despite the simplicity of our approach, which can be succinctly Cites: Incorporating Discriminator in Sentence Generation: a Gibbs
