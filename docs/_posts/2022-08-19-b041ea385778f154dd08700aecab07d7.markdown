This paper summarizes model improvements and inference-time optimizations for the popular anchor-based detectors in the scenes of autonomous driving. Based on the high-performing RCNN-RS and RetinaNet-RS detection frameworks designed for common detection scenes, we study a set of framework improvements to adapt the detectors to better detect small objects in crowd scenes. Then, we propose a model scaling strategy by scaling input resolution and model size to achieve a better speed Cites: Efficient scale-permuted backbone with learned resource distribution
