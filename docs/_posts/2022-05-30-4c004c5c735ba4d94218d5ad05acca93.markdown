In many practical data sets, such as co-citation and co-authorship, relationships across the samples are more complex than pair-wise. Hypergraphs provide a flexible and natural representation for such complex correlations and thus obtain increasing attention in the machine learning and data mining communities. Existing deep-learning-based hypergraph approaches seek to learn the latent vertex representations based on either vertices or hyperedges from previous layers and … Cites: ‪Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and …‬
