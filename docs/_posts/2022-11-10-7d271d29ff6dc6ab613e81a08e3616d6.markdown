In this paper we present a simple re-ranking method for Automatic Sentence Simplification based on the noisy channel scheme. Instead of directly computing the best simplification given a complex text, the re-ranking method also considers the probability of the simple sentence to produce the complex counterpart, as well as the probability of the simple text itself, according to a language model. Our experiments show that combining these scores outperform the original system in three different …
