As a representative of shared mobility, bike sharing has become a green and convenient way to travel in cities in recent years. Bike usage prediction becomes more important for supporting efficient operation and management in bike share systems as the basis of inventory management and bike rebalancing. The essential of usage prediction in bike sharing systems is to model the spatial interactions of nearby stations, the temporal dependence of demands, and the impacts of
