Irony is a ubiquitous figurative language in daily communication. Previously, many researchers have approached irony from linguistic, cognitive science, and computational aspects. Recently, some progress have been witnessed in automatic irony processing due to the rapid development in deep neural models in natural language processing (NLP). In this paper, we will provide a comprehensive overview of computational irony, insights from linguistic theory and cognitive science, as well  Cites: Testing the Ability of Language Models to Interpret Figurative
