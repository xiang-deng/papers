Labels noise refers to errors in training labels caused by cheap data annotation methods, such as web scraping or crowd-sourcing, which can be detrimental to the performance of supervised classifiers. Several methods have been proposed to counteract the effect of random label noise in supervised classification, and some studies have shown that BERT is already robust against high rates of randomly injected label noise. However, real label noise is not random; rather, it is often …
