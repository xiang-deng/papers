Despite the success of recent abstractive summarizers on automatic evaluation metrics, the generated summaries still present factual inconsistencies with the source document. In this paper, we focus on entity-level factual inconsistency, ie reducing the mismatched entities between the generated summaries and the source documents. We therefore propose a novel entity-based SpanCopy mechanism, and explore its extension with a Global Relevance component. Experiment results on four Cites: Text summarization with pretrained encoders
