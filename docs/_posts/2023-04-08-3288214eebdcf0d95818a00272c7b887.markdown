Semantic Shift Detection (SSD) is the task of identifying, interpreting, and assessing the possible change over time in the meanings of a target word. Traditionally, SSD has been addressed by linguists and social scientists through manual and time-consuming activities. In the recent years, computational approaches based on Natural Language Processing and word embeddings gained increasing attention to automate SSD as much as possible. In particular, over the past three years Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
