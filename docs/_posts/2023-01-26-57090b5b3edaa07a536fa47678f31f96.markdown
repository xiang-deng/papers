In this supplementary material, we provide the following: 1) Pseudocodes for LapTAO and TAO (section 1); 2) Derivation of the solution for the label-step (section 2); 3) How to accelerate the labelstep in LapTAO (section 3); 4) Description of the experimental setup: datasets, comparison methods, hyperparameters, etc.(section 4); 5) Additional experimental results (section 5): comparison with SSCT [6] and EBBS, decision tree visualizations, etc. Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
