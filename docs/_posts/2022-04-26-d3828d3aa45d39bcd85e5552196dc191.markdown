Abstract Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a promising technique to predict highly localized fine particulate matter (ie, PM 2.5 levels) based on high-resolution satellite imagery. Unfortunately, CNNs typically require large amounts of supervised data to perform well, whereas this application generally has lots of unsupervised data (all satellite imagery) and relatively sparse supervised data (measurements from ground sensors).
