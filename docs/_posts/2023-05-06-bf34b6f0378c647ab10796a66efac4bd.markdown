Few-shot named entity recognition (NER) systems aims at recognizing new classes of entities based on a few labeled samples. A significant challenge in the few-shot regime is prone to overfitting than the tasks with abundant samples. The heavy overfitting in few-shot learning is mainly led by spurious correlation caused by the few samples selection bias. To alleviate the problem of the spurious correlation in the few-shot NER, in this paper, we propose a causal intervention-based few-shot NER …
