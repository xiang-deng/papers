This paper presents algorithms that combine these two approaches in the context of streaming and heterogeneous data. The overall goal is to maximize the chances to spot duplicates to a given entity profile in a moment closest to its arrival time (early quality), without relying on any schema information, while being sufficiently efficient to process large volumes of fast streaming data without compromising the eventual quality (by cutting too many corners for efficiency). Experiments validate that our Cites: Sample-driven schema mapping
