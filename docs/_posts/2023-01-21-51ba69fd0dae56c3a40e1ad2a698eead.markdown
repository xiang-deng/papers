Relational graph neural networks (RGNNs) are graph neural networks (GNNs) with dedicated structures for modeling the different types of nodes and/or edges in heterogeneous graphs. While RGNNs have been increasingly adopted in many real-world applications due to their versatility and accuracy, they pose performance and system design challenges due to their inherent computation patterns, gap between the programming interface and kernel APIs, and heavy programming efforts in Cites: Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text
