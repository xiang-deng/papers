For imbalanced classification, data-level methods can achieve inter-class balance, but the samples generated do not contain new information and cannot avoid the problem of introducing noise. Algorithm-level methods may lead to overfitting of the model, and its classification effect is more dependent on the specific dataset and classification task, which means they lack universality. In addition, how to deeply mine the differences in the distribution of data overlap areas, and how to effectively Cites: BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
