Concept generation is a creative step in the conceptual design phase, where designers often turn to brainstorming, mindmapping, or crowdsourcing design ideas to complement their own knowledge of the domain. Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) have led to the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of generating seemingly creative outputs from textual prompts. The success of these models has led to their integration and Cites: Selective annotation makes language models better few-shot
