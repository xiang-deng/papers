Large language models~(LLMs) present an intriguing avenue of exploration in the domain of formal theorem proving. Nonetheless, the full utilization of these models, particularly in terms of demonstration formatting and organization, remains an underexplored area. In an endeavor to enhance the efficacy of LLMs, we introduce a subgoal-based demonstration learning framework, consisting of two primary elements: Firstly, drawing upon the insights of subgoal learning from the domains of …
