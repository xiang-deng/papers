Up to now, no consistent fatigue assessment approach of powder metallurgy (PM) components is available. For some materials and for some parameters, such as the density, a relationship to the fatigue strength is known; however, for other materials, such relationships are unknown. Based on an extensive data set with 828 test series, the present work addresses this problem by conceiving and applying five machine learning (ML)based approaches to increase the accuracy of the prediction of the  Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
