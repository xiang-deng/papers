As an emerging research topic in the field of machine learning, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer prior knowledge from the source domain to help training the unsupervised target domain model. Although a variety of UDA works have been proposed, they mainly concentrate on scenarios from one source to one target (1S1T) or multi-source to one target domain (mS1T), the works on UDA from one source to multi-target (1SmT) is rare and they are mainly designed for ordinary Cites: Multi-Source Domain Adaptation for Text Classification via
