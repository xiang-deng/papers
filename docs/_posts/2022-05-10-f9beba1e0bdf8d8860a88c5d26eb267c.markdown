We present a comprehensive work on automated veracity assessment from dataset creation to developing novel methods based on Natural Language Inference (NLI), focusing on misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The dataset construction includes work on retrieval techniques and similarity measurements to ensure a Cites: Reasoning over semantic-level graph for fact checking
