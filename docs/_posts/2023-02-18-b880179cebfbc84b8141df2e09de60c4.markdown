Retrobiosynthesis provides an effective and sustainable approach to producing functional molecules. The past few decades have witnessed a rapid expansion of biosynthetic approaches. With the recent advances in data-driven sciences, machine learning (ML) is enriching the retrobiosynthesis design toolbox and being applied to each step of the synthesis design workflow, including retrosynthesis planning, enzyme identification and engineering, and pathway optimization. The ability to learn …
