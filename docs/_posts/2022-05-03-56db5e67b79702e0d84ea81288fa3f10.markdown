Decentralized optimization with multiple networked clients/learners has advanced machine learning significantly over the past few years. When data distributions at different nodes/locations are heterogeneous, consensus-based decentralized algorithms ignore distinctive features of local data samples. In this paper, we propose a decentralized client adaptation strategy for personalized learning by taking local client data structures into account. It turns out that optimizing the model parameters Cites: Taming maml: Efficient unbiased meta-reinforcement learning
