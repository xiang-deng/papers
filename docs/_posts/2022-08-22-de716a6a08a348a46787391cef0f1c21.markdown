In a situated multi-agent system, an intelligent agent aims to gain and share knowledge of the environment to fulfill the local and global goals. In such systems, agents are supposed to consume energy for performing their tasks based on the perception of the environment and behaviors. In a real application, the energy consumption is costly for the system. Therefore, it is crucial to optimize the agent behavior that makes the system more cost-efficient.
