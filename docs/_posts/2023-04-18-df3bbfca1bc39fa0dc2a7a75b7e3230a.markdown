The success of deep learning in recent years has lead to a rising demand for neural network architecture engineering. As a consequence, neural architecture search (NAS), which aims at automatically designing neural network architectures in a data-driven manner rather than manually, has evolved as a popular field of research. With the advent of weight sharing strategies across architectures, NAS has become applicable to a much wider range of problems. In particular, there are now many Cites: Automl-zero: Evolving machine learning algorithms from scratch
