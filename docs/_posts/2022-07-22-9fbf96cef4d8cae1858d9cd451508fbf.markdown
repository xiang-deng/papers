Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents may only have incomplete information about tasks to solve. Although inferring the latent task could improve the performance, blindly trusting the task estimates may cause significant performance drops due to inevitable inference errors. One dominant way to enhance robustness is to optimize over worst-possible tasks, which may generate overly conservative policies and have difficulties balancing the performance and robustness. Moreover, most sequential Cites: Distributionally robust neural networks for group shifts: On the
