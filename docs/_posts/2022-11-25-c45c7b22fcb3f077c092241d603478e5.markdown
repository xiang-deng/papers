Capturing concepts interrelations is a fundamental of natural language understanding. It constitutes a bridge between two historically separate approaches of artificial intelligence: the use of symbolic and distributed representations. However, tackling this problem without human supervision poses several issues, and unsupervised models have difficulties echoing the expressive breakthroughs of supervised ones. This thesis addresses two supervision gaps we identified: the Cites: Open information extraction from the web
