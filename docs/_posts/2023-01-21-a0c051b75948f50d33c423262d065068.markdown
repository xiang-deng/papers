Automatic defect detection on the metal surface is a vital task for product inspection in industrial assembly lines or production processes. Owing to miscellaneous patterns of defects, inter-class similarity, intra-class difference, and fewer defect samples, achieving accurate and automatic detection remains a big challenge. What s more, since the rising demand for production efficiency, real-time detection is increasingly desirable. This article proposes a semantic prior and extremely efficient  Cites: ESPNetv2: A Light-weight, Power Efficient, and General Purpose
