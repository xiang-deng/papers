Researchers have proposed various information extraction (IE) techniques to convert news articles into structured knowledge for news understanding. However, none of the existing methods have explicitly addressed the issue of framing bias that is inherent in news articles. We argue that studying and identifying framing bias is a crucial step towards trustworthy event understanding. We propose a novel task, neutral event graph induction, to address this problem. An event graph is a network …
