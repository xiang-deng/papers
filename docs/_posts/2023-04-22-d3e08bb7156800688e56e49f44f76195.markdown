Transformer and its derivatives are widely used in industrial internet of things due to their excellent performance. However, the scale of these network models is exceptionally large, generating significant memory overhead and computational load during training and inference, as well as consuming large amounts of power resources. Therefore, these existing network models cannot be trained and deployed on resource-constrained industrial embedded devices, thus limiting their  Cites: Delight: Deep and light-weight transformer
