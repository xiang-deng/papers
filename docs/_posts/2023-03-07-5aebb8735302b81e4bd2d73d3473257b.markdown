Understanding the acting wear mechanisms in many cases is key for predicting lifetime, developing models describing component behavior or for the improvement of performance of components under tribological loading. Conventionally Scanning-Electron-Microscopy (SEM) and sometimes additional analytical techniques are performed in order to analyze wear appearances, ie grooves, pittings, surface films, and others. In addition, experience is required in order to draw the correct and Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
