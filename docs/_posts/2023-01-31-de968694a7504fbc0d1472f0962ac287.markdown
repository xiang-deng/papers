Citation and citation-based metrics are traditionally used to quantify the scholarly impact of scientific papers. However, for documents without citation data, ie, newly published papers, the citation-based metrics are not available.

Specifically, a large-scale Pre-Trained Model (PTM) with 110 million parameters is …
