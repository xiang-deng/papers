Finger vein biometrics is becoming an important source of human authentication due to its advantages in terms of liveness detection, high security, and user convenience. Although there exist a lot of deep learning-based methods for finger vein authentication, they only extract features from finger vein images in the spatial domain and may lose some important information that is present in other domains, such as the frequency domain. Motivated by this conjecture and the remarkable Cites: Pay attention to mlps
