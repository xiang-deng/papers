U-Clip is a simple amendment to gradient clipping that can be applied to any iterative gradient optimization algorithm. Like regular clipping, U-Clip involves using gradients that are clipped to a prescribed size (eg with component wise or norm based clipping) but instead of discarding the clipped portion of the gradient, U-Clip maintains a buffer of these values that is added to the gradients on the next iteration (before clipping). We show that the cumulative bias of the U-Clip updates is bounded …
