Annotations in condition monitoring systems contain information regarding asset history and fault characteristics in the form of unstructured text that could, if unlocked, be used for intelligent fault diagnosis. However, processing these annotations with pre-trained natural language models such as BERT is problematic due to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) technical terms, resulting in inaccurate language embeddings. Here we investigate the effect of OOV technical terms on BERT and SentenceBERT Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
