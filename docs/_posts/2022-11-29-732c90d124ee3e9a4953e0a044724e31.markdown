The paper s goal is to investigate a matching algorithm that can be used to connect records of cultural heritage data from various data sources and enhances the precision and effectiveness of the matching operations involved in this process. The foundation of this work is a fuzzy match similarity (FMS) function, which explicitly associates weights with tokens to measure their relative relevance while reading a string as a series of tokens.
