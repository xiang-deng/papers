In this paper, a salient object detection model based on multi-feature and modified manifold ranking is proposed. Different from traditional manifold ranking based models, the graphs in the proposed model are constructed by multiple features, and the energy function of manifold ranking is modified to accurately indicate the queries ranking process. Then, the four boundary regions of the image are ranked respectively based on multi-feature graphs with the improved ranking process to get Cites: Ranking on data manifolds.
