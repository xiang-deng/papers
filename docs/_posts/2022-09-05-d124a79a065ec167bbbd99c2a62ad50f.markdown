Social and real-world considerations such as robustness, fairness, social welfare and multi-agent tradeoffs have given rise to multi-distribution learning paradigms, such as collaborative [4], group distributionally robust [27], and fair federated learning [20]. In each of these settings, a learner seeks to minimize its worst-case loss over a set of n predefined distributions, while using as few samples as possible. In this paper, we establish the optimal sample complexity of these learning Cites: Distributionally robust neural networks for group shifts: On the
