The field of machine learning, particularly deep learning, has witnessed tremendous recent advances due to improvements in algorithms, compute, and datasets. Systems built to support deep learning have primarily targeted computations used to produce the learned model. This thesis proposes to instead focus on the role of data in both training and validation. For the first part of the thesis, we focus on training data, demonstrating that the data pipeline responsible for training data is a prime …
