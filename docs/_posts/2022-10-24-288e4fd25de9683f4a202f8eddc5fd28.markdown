Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to discern outliers from the intended data distribution, which is crucial to maintaining high reliability and a good user experience. Most recent studies in OOD detection utilize the information from a single representation that resides in the penultimate layer to determine whether the input is anomalous or not. Although such a method is straightforward, the potential of diverse information in the intermediate layers is overlooked. In this paper, we propose a Cites: SLM: Learning a discourse language representation with sentence
