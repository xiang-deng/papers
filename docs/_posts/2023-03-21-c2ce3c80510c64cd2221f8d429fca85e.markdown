Relation triple extraction is a combination of named entity recognition and relation prediction. Early works ignore the problem of data overlap when extracting triples, resulting in poor extraction performance. Subsequent works improve the capability of the model to extract overlapping triples through generative and extractive methods. These works achieve considerable performance but still suffer from some defects, such as poor extraction capability for individual triplets and inappropriate spatial  Cites: Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text
