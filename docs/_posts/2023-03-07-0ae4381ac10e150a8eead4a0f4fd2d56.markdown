Span classification is a popular method for nested named entity recognition. To recognise full-span named entities, span-based models should enumerate and verify all possible entity spans in a sentence, which leads to serious problems regarding computational complexity and data imbalance. In this study, we propose a boundary regression model to support full-span named entity recognition, where a regression operation is adopted to refine spatial locations of entity spans in a sentence …
