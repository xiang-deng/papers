This paper describes an algorithm for automatically extracting multiword expressions (MWEs) from a corpus. The algorithm is nodebased, ie extracts MWEs that contain the item specified by the user, using a fixed window-size around the node. The main idea is to detect the frequency anomalies that occur at the starting and ending points of an ngram that constitutes a MWE. This is achieved by locally comparing matrices of observed frequencies to matrices of expected frequencies, and determining, for …
