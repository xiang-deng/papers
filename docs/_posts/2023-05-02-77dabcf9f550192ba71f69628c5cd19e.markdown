Extracting structured information from all manner of webpages is an important problem with the potential to automate many real-world applications. Recent work has shown the effectiveness of leveraging DOM trees and pre-trained language models to describe and encode webpages. However, they typically optimize the model to learn the semantic co-occurrence of elements and labels in the same webpage, thus their effectiveness depends on sufficient labeled data, which is labor …
