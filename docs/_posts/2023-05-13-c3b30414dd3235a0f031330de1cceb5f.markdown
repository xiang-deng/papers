ABSTRACT AI applications are driving the need for large dedicated GPU clusters, which are highly energy-and carbon-intensive. To efficiently operate these clusters, operators leverage workload forecasts that inform resource allocation decisions to save energy without sacrificing performance. The traditional forecasting methods provide a single-point forecast and do not expose the uncertainty about their predictions, which can lead to an unexpected loss in performance. In this paper, we …
