Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a non-invasive geophysical method that can be used to assist in mapping karstified zones in outcrop analogous for the characterization and understanding of carbonate oil reservoirs. Supported by GPR data, it is possible to understand the behavior of karstification processes in carbonate rocks and thus expand the knowledge to the reservoir level. In addition, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have allowed the application of  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
