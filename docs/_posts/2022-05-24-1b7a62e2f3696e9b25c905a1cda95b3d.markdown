Two important problems in behavioral medicine are modeling the risk of adverse health behaviors such as smoking, and classifying longitudinal health data to determine health conditions. Models for each can be used for prediction in order to inform just in time adaptive interventions (JITAI) and inference to help behavioral scientists understand processes driving these behaviors. In this thesis we propose several models for both event risk and factors that contribute to risk for behaviors Cites: Random feature attention
