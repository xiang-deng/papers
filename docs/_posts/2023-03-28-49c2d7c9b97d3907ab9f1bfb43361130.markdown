In Task Oriented Dialogue (TOD) system, detecting and inducing new intents are two main challenges to apply the system in the real world. In this paper, we suggest the semantic multi-view model to resolve these two challenges:(1) SBERT for General Embedding (GE),(2) Multi Domain Batch (MDB) for dialogue domain knowledge, and (3) Proxy Gradient Transfer (PGT) for cluster-specialized semantic. MDB feeds diverse dialogue datasets to the model at once to tackle the multi-domain problem by  Cites: TOD-BERT: Pre-trained natural language understanding for task
