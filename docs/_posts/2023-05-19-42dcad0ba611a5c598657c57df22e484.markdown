This paper investigates the differences in data organization between contrastive and supervised learning methods, focusing on the concept of locally dense clusters. We introduce a novel metric, Relative Local Density (RLD), to quantitatively measure local density within clusters. Visual examples are provided to highlight the distinctions between locally dense clusters and globally dense ones. By comparing the clusters formed by contrastive and supervised learning, we reveal that contrastive …
