Forests can be efficiently monitored by automatic semantic segmentation of trees using satellite and/or aerial images. Still, several challenges can make the problem difficult, including the varying spectral signature of different trees, lack of sufficient labelled data, and geometrical occlusions. In this paper, we address the tree segmentation problem using multispectral imagery. While we carry out large-scale experiments on several deep learning architectures using various spectral input Cites: Espnet: Efficient spatial pyramid of dilated convolutions for
