Deep learning has attracted considerable attention across many natural language processing (NLP) domains. Deep learning models aim to learn embeddings of data with multiple levels of abstraction through multiple layers for either labelled structured input data or unlabelled unstructured input data. Currently, two research trends have emerged in building higher level embeddings. On one hand, a strong trend in deep learning leads towards increasingly powerful and complex models. On
