Recently, prompt-based learning has shown impressive performance on various natural language processing tasks in few-shot scenarios. The previous study of knowledge probing showed that the success of prompt learning contributes to the implicit knowledge stored in pre-trained language models. However, how this implicit knowledge helps solve downstream tasks remains unclear. In this work, we propose a knowledge-guided prompt learning method that can reveal relevant knowledge for Cites: OpenPrompt: An Open-source Framework for Prompt-learning
