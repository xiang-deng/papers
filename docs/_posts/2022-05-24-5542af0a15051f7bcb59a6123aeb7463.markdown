Recent studies have shown the promising performance of deep learning models (eg, RNN and Transformer) for long-term time series forecasting. These studies mostly focus on designing deep models to effectively combine historical information for long-term forecasting. However, the question of how to effectively represent historical information for long-term forecasting has not received enough attention, limiting our capacity to exploit powerful deep learning models. The main challenge in time series … Cites: ‪Luna: Linear unified nested attention‬
