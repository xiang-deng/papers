Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are used for predictive analytics on graph-structured data, and they have become very popular in diverse real-world applications. Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM)-based PIM architectures can accelerate GNN training. However, GNN training on ReRAMbased architectures is both compute-and data-intensive in nature. In this work, we propose a framework called SlimGNN that synergistically combines both graph and model pruning to accelerate …
