Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) derive inspiration from recent advances in computer vision, by stacking layers of first-order filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to learn entity or graph embeddings. Although GCNs have been shown to boost the performance of many network analysis tasks, they still face tremendous challenges in learning from Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), where relations play a decisive role in knowledge reasoning. What s more …
