Current conversational passage retrieval systems cast conversational search into ad- hoc search by using an intermediate query resolution step that places the user s question in context of the conversation. While the proposed methods have proven effective, they still assume the availability of large-scale question resolution and conversational search datasets. To waive the dependency on the availability of such data, we adapt a pre-trained token-level dense retriever on ad-hoc search data to Cites: KILT: a benchmark for knowledge intensive language tasks
