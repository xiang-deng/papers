Automatically annotating semantic type of table column task plays a vital role in the process of information retrieval and NLP tasks. In this paper, given an entity column of a table without a header, we study the problem of predicting its column type using both finetuning on pre-trained BERT model and knowledge graph lookup, integrating the two methods to complement each other s shortcomings. A data augmentation method utilizing similar entities in Wikipedia categories and lists is proposed to fine Cites: Turl: Table understanding through representation learning
