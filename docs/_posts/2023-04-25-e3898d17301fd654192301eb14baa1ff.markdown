Probing strategies have been shown to detect the presence of various linguistic features in large language models; in particular, semantic features intermediate to the  natural logic  fragment of the Natural Language Inference task (NLI). In the case of natural logic, the relation between the intermediate features and the entailment label is explicitly known: as such, this provides a ripe setting for interventional studies on the NLI models  representations, allowing for stronger causal conjectures and a …
