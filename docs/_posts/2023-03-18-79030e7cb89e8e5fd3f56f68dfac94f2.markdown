The traditional metallogenic prediction based on the geological model has been extensively used in prospecting, and the emerging machine learning method has also been successfully applied to mineral prospectivity prediction. In this study, we proposed a method based on the combination of model-driven and data-driven approaches, which was applied to the prospective area of the gold deposits in Xiong ershan area. In this method, the geological prospecting model was taken as Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
