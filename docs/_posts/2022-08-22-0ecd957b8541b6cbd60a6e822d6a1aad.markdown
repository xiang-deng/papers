Reinforced concrete shear walls are used in many structural systems to resist earthquake loading. In recent earthquakes, shear wall buildings have tended to perform well. Modern building codes include provisions concerning shear capacity, which are recognized for their effectiveness. Studies have demonstrated that the American Concrete Institute (ACI) 318-19 provision uses a low safety factor and does not cover high-strength concrete shear walls whereas the Eurocode 8 provision is Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
