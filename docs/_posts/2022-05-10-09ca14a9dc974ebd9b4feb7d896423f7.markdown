A comprehensive review of the methods for topological analysis of crystalline compounds as applied to the structures of coordination polymers is presented for the first time. The basic concepts of reticular chemistry, a new branch of science, which combines methods of synthetic chemistry with methods for topological design of polymer compounds, are considered. Reticular chemistry methods are illustrated with examples of the analysis and design of coordination polymers. The most Cites: Theoretical limits of hydrogen storage in metalorganic
