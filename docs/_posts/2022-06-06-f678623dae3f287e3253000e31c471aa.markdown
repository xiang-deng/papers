We study the problem of meta-safe reinforcement learning (meta-SRL) through the CMDP-within-online framework and show that the task-averaged optimality gap and constraint satisfaction improve with task-similarity in the static environment or task-relatedness in the changing environment. Several technical challenges arise when making this framework practical while still having strong theoretical guarantees. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-algorithm that performs inexact online …
