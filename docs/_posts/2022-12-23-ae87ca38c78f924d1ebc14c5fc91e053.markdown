Inductive reasoning is a core component of human intelligence. In the past research of inductive reasoning within computer science, logic language is used as representations of knowledge (facts and rules, more specifically). However, logic language can cause systematic problems for inductive reasoning such as disability of handling raw input such as natural language, sensitiveness to mislabeled data, and incapacity to handle ambiguous input. To this end, we propose a new task …
