Fake news is a severe organizational and societal problem as social media further aggravates its spread. Detecting Fake news in real-time is a critical for tackling this challenging scientific problem as it can help stem its spread and consumption quickly. In this study, we propose a computational approach to detect fake news in a real-time manner. Our proposed method leverages event and topic extraction techniques coupled with a topic merging mechanism to process news data and  Cites: Stanza: A python natural language processing toolkit for many
