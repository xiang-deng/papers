Over the last decade, machine learning practitioners in fields like computer vision and natural language processing have devoted vast resources to building models that successively improve performance numbers on a small number of prominent benchmarks. While performance on these benchmarks has steadily increased, real-world deployments of learning systems continue to encounter difficulties with robustness and reliability. The contrast between the optimistic picture of progress …
