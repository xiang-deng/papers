Automated visual inspection has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of inspection tasks across various industries. Deep learning models have been at the forefront of many automated visual inspection technologies. In this work, we focus on a specific instance of a visual inspection problem: the defect detection and classification problem. Training a deep learning model from scratch to detect defects is challenging due to the scarcity of labeled images with defects. Moreover, it is …
