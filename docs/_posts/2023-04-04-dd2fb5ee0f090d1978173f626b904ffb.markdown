Autoregressive (AR) encoder-decoder neural networks have proved successful in many NLP problems, including Semantic Parsing--a task that translates natural language to machine-readable parse trees. However, the sequential prediction process of AR models can be slow. To accelerate AR for semantic parsing, we introduce a new technique called TreePiece that tokenizes a parse tree into subtrees and generates one subtree per decoding step. On TopV2 benchmark, TreePiece  Cites: Learning an executable neural semantic parser
