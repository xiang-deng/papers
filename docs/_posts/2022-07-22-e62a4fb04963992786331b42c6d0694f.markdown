Abstract Knowledge of the soil organic carbon (SOC) content is critical for environmental sustainability and carbon neutrality. With the development of remote sensing data and prediction models, the comprehensive utilization of multisource remote sensing data based on a fusion approach and testing its effectiveness in SOC content prediction is an interesting and challenging topic. However, there is no evidence showing the role of different data sources in the SOC content prediction  Cites: Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate
