Supervised learning is a classic paradigm of relation extraction (RE). However, a well-performing model can still confidently make arbitrarily wrong predictions when exposed to samples of unseen relations. In this work, we propose a relation extraction method with rejection option to improve robustness to unseen relations. To enable the classifier to reject unseen relations, we introduce contrastive learning techniques and carefully design a set of class-preserving transformations to improve Cites: Graph convolution over pruned dependency trees improves
