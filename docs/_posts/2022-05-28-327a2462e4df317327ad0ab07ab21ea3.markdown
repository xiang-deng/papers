We present HyperLogLogLog, a practical compression of the HyperLogLog sketch that compresses the sketch from $ O (m\log\log n) $ bits down to $ m\log_2\log_2\log_2 m+ O (m+\log\log n) $ bits for estimating the number of distinct elements~ $ n $ using $ m $~ registers. The algorithm works as a drop-in replacement that preserves all estimation properties of the HyperLogLog sketch, it is possible to convert back and forth between the compressed and uncompressed  Cites: Goods: Organizing google s datasets
