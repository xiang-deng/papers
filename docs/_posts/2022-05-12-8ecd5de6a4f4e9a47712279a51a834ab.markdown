Although pedestrian detection has achieved promising performance with the development of deep learning techniques, it remains a great challenge to detect heavily occluded pedestrians in crowd scenes. Therefore, to make the anchor-free network pay more attention to learning the hard examples of occluded pedestrians, we propose a simple but effective Occlusion-aware Anchor-Free Network (namely OAF-Net) for pedestrian detection in crowd scenes. Specifically, we first design a Cites: Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database
