Fine-tuning a language model on a new domain is standard practice for domain adaptation. However, it can be infeasible when it comes to modern large-scale language models such as GPT-3, which can only be accessed through APIs, making it difficult to access the internal parameters of the model. In this paper, we propose $ k $ NN-Adapter, a method to effectively adapt these black-box large language models (LLMs) to a new domain. The $ k $ NN-Adapter builds on top of the retrieval Cites: Meta-Learning Fast Weight Language Models
