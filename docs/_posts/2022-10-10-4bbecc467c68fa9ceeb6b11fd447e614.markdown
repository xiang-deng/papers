We study the relationship between task-agnostic intrinsic and task-specific extrinsic social bias evaluation measures for Masked Language Models (MLMs), and find that there exists only a weak correlation between these two types of evaluation measures. Moreover, we find that MLMs debiased using different methods still re-learn social biases during fine-tuning on downstream tasks. We identify the social biases in both training instances as well as their assigned labels as reasons for the …
