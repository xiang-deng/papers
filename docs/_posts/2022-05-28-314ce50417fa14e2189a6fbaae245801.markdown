Data artifacts incentivize machine learning models to learn non-transferable generalizations by taking advantage of shortcuts in the data, and there is growing evidence that data artifacts play a role for the strong results that deep learning models achieve in recent natural language processing benchmarks. In this paper, we focus on task-oriented dialogue and investigate whether popular datasets such as MultiWOZ contain such data artifacts. We found that by only keeping frequent … Cites: ‪Are we modeling the task or the annotator? an investigation of …‬
