Given the speedy development of Internet technology, the amount of information we get is increasing explosively, so the extraction and summary of information are extremely important. Text summarization technology, as one of the important research of natural language processing, can extract text expressing core ideas from massive data, to quickly obtain the required information. However, the traditional recurrent neural network has weak parallel computing ability, and there are cases of Cites: Evaluating the factual consistency of abstractive text summarization
