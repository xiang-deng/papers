Relation extraction is a crucial step in the constructions of knowledge graphs (KGs). However, relation extraction is performed manually in the manufacturing field due to the sentence characteristics, which include weak correlation and high entity density. This approach has the disadvantages of low efficiency and high dependence on experts. At present, very few studies have been performed on relation extraction in the manufacturing field, so establishing a relation extraction model with high Cites: Graph convolution over pruned dependency trees improves
