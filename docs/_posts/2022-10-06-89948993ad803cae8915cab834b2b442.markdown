With the increasing economic and social development, the load forecasting of the power system plays an increasingly important role in many energy-related fields such as energy dispatching, market-based price forecasting, and capacity allocation for the government and power companies. Based on the long-term research of many scholars, this paper aims to provide a general overview of some specific categories of load forecasting methods and models. Linear models can meet the real needs of …
