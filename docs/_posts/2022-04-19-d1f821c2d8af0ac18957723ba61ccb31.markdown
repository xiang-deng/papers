To effectively train accurate Relation Extraction models, sufficient and properly labeled data is required. Adequately labeled data is difficult to obtain and annotating such data is a tricky undertaking. Previous works have shown that either accuracy has to be sacrificed or the task is extremely time-consuming, if done accurately. We are proposing an approach in order to produce high-quality datasets for the task of Relation Extraction quickly.
