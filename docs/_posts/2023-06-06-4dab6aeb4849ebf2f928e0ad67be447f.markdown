With the increasing popularity and the increasing size of vision transformers (ViTs), there has been an increasing interest in making them more efficient and less computationally costly for deployment on edge devices with limited computing resources. Binarization can be used to help reduce the size of ViT models and their computational cost significantly, using popcount operations when the weights and the activations are in binary. However, ViTs suffer a larger performance drop when Cites: Bit: Robustly binarized multi-distilled transformer
