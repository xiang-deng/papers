Commoditization and broad adoption of machine learning (ML) technologies expose users of these technologies to new security risks. Many models today are based on neural networks. Training and deploying these models for real-world applications involves complex hardware and software pipelines applied to training data from many sources. Models trained on untrusted data are vulnerable to poisoning attacks that introduce  backdoor  functionality. Compromising a fraction of the training data …
