Semantic communication has recently attracted significant interest from both industry and academia due to its potential to transform the existing data-focused communication architecture towards a more generally intelligent and goal-oriented semantic-aware networking system. Despite its promising potential, semantic communications and semantic-aware networking are still at their infancy. Most existing works focus on transporting and delivering the explicit semantic information Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
