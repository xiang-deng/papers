Adversarial machine learning has been extensively studied from perspectives of attack settings and defense strategies. However, existing adversarial training models fail to be adaptive and robust against new attacks during test time. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarially adaptive defense (AAD) framework based on adaptive training such that the trained prediction and detection models adapt at test time to new attacks. Our AAD structures the training data into groups and each group  Cites: Stronger data poisoning attacks break data sanitization defenses
