We present a novel and effective method calibrating cross-modal features for text-based person search. Our method is cost-effective and can easily retrieve specific persons with textual captions. Specifically, its architecture is only a dual-encoder and a detachable cross-modal decoder. Without extra multi-level branches or complex interaction modules as the neck following the backbone, our model makes a high-speed inference only based on the dual-encoder. Besides, our method consists of …
