In many applications, entity references (ie, records) and entities need to be organized to capture diverse relationships like type-subtype, is-A (mapping entities to types), and duplicate (mapping records to entities) relationships. However, automatic identification of such relationships is often inaccurate due to noise and heterogeneous representation of records across sources. Similarly, manual maintenance of these relationships is infeasible and does not scale to large datasets  Cites: Structured Learning for Taxonomy Induction with Belief Propagation
