Large‐scale distributed convolution neural network (CNN) training brings two performance challenges: model performance and system performance. Large batch size usually leads to model test accuracy loss, which counteracts the benefits of parallel SGD. The existing solutions require massive hyperparameter hand‐tuning. To overcome this difficult, we analyze the training process and find that earlier training stages are more sensitive to batch size. Accordingly, we assert that different …
