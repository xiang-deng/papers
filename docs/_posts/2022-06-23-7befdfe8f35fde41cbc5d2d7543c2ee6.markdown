Recent emerging machine learning techniques have been applied to solve a wide variety of biological engineering problems. The success of many machine learning models heavily depends on the availability of related labeled data regarding the prediction task. However, due to the high cost of experimental measurements and biochemical data scarcity, obtaining labeled data is typically difficult. The hypothesis in this thesis is that using abundant auxiliary heterogeneous biochemical data for
