We propose an entity-agnostic representation learning method for handling the problem of inefficient parameter storage costs brought by embedding knowledge graphs. Conventional knowledge graph embedding methods map elements in a knowledge graph, including entities and relations, into continuous vector spaces by assigning them one or multiple specific embeddings (ie, vector representations). Thus the number of embedding parameters increases linearly as the growth of Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
