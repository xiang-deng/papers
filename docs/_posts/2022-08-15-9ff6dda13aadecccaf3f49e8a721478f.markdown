The design of complex engineering systems is an often long and articulated process that highly relies on engineers expertise and professional judgment. As such, the typical pitfalls of activities involving the human factor often manifest themselves in terms of lack of completeness or exhaustiveness of the analysis, inconsistencies across design choices or documentation, as well as an implicit degree of subjectivity. An approach is proposed to assist systems engineers in the automatic generation of Cites: The importance of syntactic parsing and inference in semantic role
