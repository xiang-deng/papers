Contextual bandits are widely used in industrial personalization systems. These online learning frameworks learn a treatment assignment policy in the presence of treatment effects that vary with the observed contextual features of the users. While personalization creates a rich user experience that reflect individual interests, there are benefits of a shared experience across a community that enable participation in the zeitgeist. Such benefits are emergent through network effects and are not Cites: Provably optimal algorithms for generalized linear contextual bandits
