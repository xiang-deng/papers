Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) extrapolation aims to predict future unknown events (facts) based on historical information, and has attracted considerable attention due to its great practical significance. Accurate representations (embeddings) of entities and relations form the basis of TKG extrapolation. Recent work has been devoted to improving the rationality of entity representations. However, on the one hand, ignoring relation modeling results in incomplete relation …
