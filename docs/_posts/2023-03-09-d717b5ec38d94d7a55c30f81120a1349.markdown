Subgraph-based graph representation learning (SGRL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool in many prediction tasks on graphs due to its advantages in model expressiveness and generalization ability. Most previous SGRL models face computational issues associated with the high cost of extracting subgraphs for each training or testing query. Recently, SUREL has been proposed as a new framework to accelerate SGRL, which samples random walks offline and joins these walks as Cites: Introduction to statistical relational learning
