We study two model selection settings in stochastic linear bandits (LB). In the first setting, which we refer to as feature selection, the expected reward of the LB problem is in the linear span of at least one of $ M $ feature maps (models). In the second setting, the reward parameter of the LB problem is arbitrarily selected from $ M $ models represented as (possibly) overlapping balls in $\mathbb R^ d $. However, the agent only has access to misspecified models, ie, estimates of the centers and  Cites: Efficientnetv2: Smaller models and faster training
