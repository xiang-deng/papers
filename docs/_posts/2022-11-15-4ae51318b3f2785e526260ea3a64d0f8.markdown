Recent advantages from computational linguists can be leveraged to nudge students with adaptive self-evaluation based on their argumentation skill level. To investigate how individual argumentation self-evaluation will help students write more convincing texts, we designed an intelligent argumentation writing support system called ArgumentFeedback based on nudging theory and evaluated it in a series of three qualitative and quantitative studies with a total of 83 students. We found that Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
