To improve the performance of knowledge graph-based question answering system (KGQA), several approaches have been developed to construct a semantic parser based on entity linking, relation identification and logical/numerical structure identification. However, existing methods arrive at answers only by maximizing the data likelihood only on the sparse or imbalanced explicit relations, ignoring the potentially large number of latent relations. It makes KGQA suffer from a high level of Cites: Qa-gnn: Reasoning with language models and knowledge graphs
