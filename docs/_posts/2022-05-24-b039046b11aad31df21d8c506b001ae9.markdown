Intelligent agents (IAs) that use machine learning for decision-making often lack the explainability about what they are going to do, which makes human-IA collaboration challenging. However, previous methods of explaining IA behavior require IA developers to predefine vocabulary that expresses motion, which is problematic as IA decision-making becomes complex. This paper proposes Manifestor, a method for explaining an IA s future motion with autonomous vocabulary learning. With … Cites: ‪Enabling Robots to Understand Incomplete Natural Language …‬
