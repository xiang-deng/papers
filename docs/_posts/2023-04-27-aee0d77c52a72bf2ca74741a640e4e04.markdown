An explanation is made for the stable M/G/1 queueing system s threshold of Rényian and Tsallisian squared coefficient of variation (SCV) with  long-range interactions  of order, q (0.5< q< 1). The significant contribution of this letter is based on the novelty of the undertaken approach to reveal the impact of the order q, as well as the Lagrangian multiplier τs on the increasability (decreasability) themes of both Rényian and Tsallisian SCVs. The numerical data sets that will demonstrate the …
