Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) outperform conventional silicon solar cells in terms of weight and design flexibility. Therefore, besides standard rooftop installation, DSCs are suitable for new applications, including windows and walls. However, insufficient durability remains a critical issue, and outdoor working over 10 years is yet to be realized. In this study, we developed two approaches to improve the durability. The first involves hydrophobic surface passivation on the TiO2 surfaces by  Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
