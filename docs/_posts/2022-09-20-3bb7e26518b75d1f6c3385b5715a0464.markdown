As manually labelling data can be error-prone and labour-intensive, some recent studies automatically classify documents without any training on labelled data and directly exploit pre-trained language models (PLMs) for many downstream tasks, also known as zero-shot text classification. In the same vein, we propose a novel framework aims at improving zero-short learning and enriching domain specific information required by PLMs with transformer models. To unleash the power of …
