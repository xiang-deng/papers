Although a typical autopilot system far surpasses humans in term of sensing accuracy, performance stability and response agility, such a system is still far behind humans in the wisdom of understanding an unfamiliar environment with creativity, adaptivity and resiliency. Current AD brains are basically expert systems featuring logical computations, which resemble the thinking flow of a left brain working at tactical level. A right brain is needed to upgrade the safety of automated driving  Cites: (comet-) atomic 2020: On symbolic and neural commonsense
