Breast ultrasound (BUS) image segmentation is challenging and critical for BUS computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Many BUS segmentation approaches have been studied in the last two decades, but the performances of most approaches have been assessed using relatively small private datasets with different quantitative metrics, which results in a discrepancy in performance comparison. Therefore, there is a pressing need for building a benchmark to compare existing methods using a Cites: Unlabeled data improves adversarial robustness
