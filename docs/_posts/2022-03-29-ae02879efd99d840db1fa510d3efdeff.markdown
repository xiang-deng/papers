Research in unsupervised text generation has been gaining attention over the years. One recent approach is local search towards a heuristically defined objective, which specifies language fluency, semantic meanings, and other task-specific attributes. Search in the sentence space is realized by word-level edit operations including insertion, replacement, and deletion. However, such objective function is manually designed with multiple components. Although previous work has shown maximizing Cites: Data-to-text generation with content selection and planning
