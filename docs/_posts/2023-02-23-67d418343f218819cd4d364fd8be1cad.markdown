While humans can extract information from unstructured text with high precision and recall, this is often too time-consuming to be practical. Automated approaches, on the other hand, produce nearly-immediate results, but may not be reliable enough for high-stakes applications where precision is essential. In this work, we consider the benefits and drawbacks of various human-only, human-machine, and machine-only information extraction approaches. We argue for the utility of a human-in-the-loop  Cites: Benchmarking zero-shot text classification: Datasets, evaluation
