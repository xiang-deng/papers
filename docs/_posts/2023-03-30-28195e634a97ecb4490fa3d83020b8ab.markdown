The cosensitization process is an effective way to improve the performance of dyesensitized solar cells (DSSCs), especially for tandem cells that employ the complementary light harvest ranges of different dyes. Herein, various cosensitized DSSCs were prepared using D35, XY1b and Y123 dyes and employed to construct cobalt tandem DSSCs. Firstly, the performance of single cells with and without scattering layers was studied. The results show that the cosensitized cells using Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
