Graphs have enjoyed immense success as a model for analyzing pairwise interactions, such as friendships on Facebook, where people are encoded as nodes and friendships as edges that link nodes. However, many datasets exhibit higher-order interactions that go beyond the scope of the pairwise graph model, such as product co-purchasing data on Amazon. We lose important information by ignoring this higher-order structure. Currently, few methods for directly analyzing higher-order …
