Abstract VQA (Visual Question Answering) model tends to make incorrect inferences for questions that require reasoning over world knowledge. Recent study has shown that training VQA models with questions that provide lower-level perceptual information along with reasoning questions improves performance. Inspired by this, we propose a novel VQA model that generates questions to actively obtain auxiliary perceptual information useful for correct reasoning. Our model consists of a VQA …
