Cyber-physical systems (CPS) fundamentally change the way of how information systems interact with the physical world. They integrate the sensing, computing, and communication capabilities on heterogeneous platforms and infrastructures. Efficient and effective perception of the environment lays the foundation of proper operations in other CPS components (eg, planning and control). Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have unprecedentedly changed the way of how cyber systems Cites: Physical representation-based predicate optimization for a visual
