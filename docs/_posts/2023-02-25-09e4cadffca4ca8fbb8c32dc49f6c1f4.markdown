We introduce a new framework, Directional Stimulus Prompting, that uses a tuneable language model (LM) to provide guidance for the black-box frozen large language model (LLM) on downstream tasks. Unlike prior work that manually or automatically finds the optimal prompt for each task, we train a policy LM to generate discrete tokens as``directional stimulus of each input, which is a hint/cue such as keywords of an article for summarization. The directional stimulus is then combined with the Cites: Scaling instruction-finetuned language models
