Few-shot knowledge graph completion (FSKGC) refers to predicting new facts for a new relation with only few-shot observed entity pairs (triples) as support set. Existing solutions to FSKGC mainly conduct the matching process over entity pair representations. Although effective, a major concern of these models is that the entity interactions are not fully explored, based on the observation that they usually generate the pair representation before the matching stage. Such a design inherently  Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
