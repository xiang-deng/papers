Regular detection of defects in drainage pipelines is crucial. However, some problems associated with pipeline defect detection, such as data scarcity and defect counting difficulty, need to be addressed. Therefore, a Transformeroptimized generation, detection, and counting method for drainagepipeline defects was established in this paper. First, a generation network called TransGANCla was developed for data augmentation. A classification network was trained to improve the  Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
