Regular detection of defects in drainage pipelines is crucial. However, some problems associated with pipeline defect detection, such as data scarcity and defect counting difficulty, need to be addressed. Therefore, a Transformer‐optimized generation, detection, and counting method for drainage‐pipeline defects was established in this paper. First, a generation network called Trans‐GAN‐Cla was developed for data augmentation. A classification network was trained to improve the …
