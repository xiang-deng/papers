Explainable and interpretable unsupervised machine learning helps understand the underlying structure of data. We introduce an ensemble analysis of machine learning models to consolidate their interpretation. Its application shows that restricted Boltzmann machines compress consistently into a few bits the information stored in a sequence of five amino acids at the start or end of $\alpha $-helices or $\beta $-sheets. The weights learned by the machines reveal unexpected properties of the …
