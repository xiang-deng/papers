Segmentation is a core computer vision competency, with applications spanning a broad range of scientifically and economically valuable domains. To date, however, the prohibitive cost of annotation has limited the deployment of flexible segmentation models. In this work, we propose Zero-shot Unsupervised Transfer Instance Segmentation (ZUTIS), a framework that aims to meet this challenge. The key strengths of ZUTIS are:(i) no requirement for instance-level or pixel-level  Cites: Simple copy-paste is a strong data augmentation method for
