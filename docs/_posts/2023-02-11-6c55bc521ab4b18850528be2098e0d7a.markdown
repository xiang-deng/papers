With the everincreasing volume of scientific literature, there is a strong need to develop methods that allow rigorous information identification. In this contribution, a stateoftheart natural language processing (NLP) model was used to select perovskite materials for electrocatalytic applications from literature. This was accomplished by obtaining word embeddings for perovskite materials from the NLP model and subsequently designing downstream tasks to discover perovskitebased  Cites: Linguistic regularities in continuous space word representations
