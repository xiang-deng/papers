The goal of Aspect-level Sentiment Classification (ASC) is to identify the sentiment polarity towards a specific aspect of a given sentence. Mainstream methods design complicated models and require a large scale of annotated training samples, and even perform finetuning based on pre-trained language models. Therefore, those supervised methods may be impractical in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of labeled training corpora, aka low-resource settings. To this end, we …
