Conversational text-to-SQL is designed to translate multi-turn natural language questions into their corresponding SQL queries. Most state-of-the-art conversational text-to-SQL methods are incompatible with generative pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as T5. In this paper, we present a two-stage unified MultI-task Generation frAmework (MIGA) that leverages PLMs ability to tackle conversational text-to-SQL. In the pre-training stage, MIGA first decomposes the main task into  Cites: Structure-Grounded Pretraining for Text-to-SQL
