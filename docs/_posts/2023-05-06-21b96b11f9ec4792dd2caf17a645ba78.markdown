The overwhelming success of transformers is a real conundrum stimulating a compelling question: are these machines replicating some traditional linguistic models or discovering radically new theories? In this paper, we propose a novel standpoint to investigate this important question. Using typological similarities among languages, we aim to layer-wise compare transformers for different languages to observe whether these similarities emerge for particular layers.
