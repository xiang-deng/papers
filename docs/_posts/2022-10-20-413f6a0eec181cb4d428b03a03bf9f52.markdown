Recently, dynamic pruning methods have been actively researched, as they have shown very effective and remarkable performance in reducing computation complexity of deep neural networks. Nevertheless, most dynamic pruning methods fail to achieve actual acceleration due to the extra overheads caused by indexing and weight-copying to implement the dynamic sparse patterns for every input sample. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Pattern-based Pruning Network Cites: Well-read students learn better: On the importance of pre-training
