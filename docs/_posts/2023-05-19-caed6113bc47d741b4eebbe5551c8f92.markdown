How can AI enhance creative coding experiences for families? This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) in helping families with creative coding using Scratch. Based on our previous user study involving a prototype AI assistant, we devised three evaluation scenarios to determine if LLMs could help families comprehend game code, debug programs, and generate new ideas for future projects. We utilized 22 Scratch projects for each scenario and generated  Cites: StoryBuddy: A Human-AI Collaborative Chatbot for Parent-Child
