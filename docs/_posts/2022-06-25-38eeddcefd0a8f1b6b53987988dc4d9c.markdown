The research advances concerning the typical architectures of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as well as their optimizations are analyzed and elaborated in detail in this paper. This paper proposes a typical approach to classifying CNNs architecture based on modules in order to accommodate more new network architectures with multiple characteristics that make them difficult to rely on the original classification method. Through the pros and cons analysis of diverse network …
