The lack of interpretability in artificial intelligence models (ie, deep learning, machine learning, and rules-based) is an obstacle to their widespread adoption in the healthcare domain. The absence of understandability and transparency frequently leads to (i) inadequate accountability and (ii) a consequent reduction in the quality of the predictive results of the models. On the other hand, the existence of interpretability in the predictions of AI models will facilitate the understanding and Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
