We introduce efficient deep learning-based methods for legal document processing including Legal Document Retrieval and Legal Question Answering tasks in the Automated Legal Question Answering Competition (ALQAC 2022). In this competition, we achieve 1\textsuperscript {st} place in the first task and 3\textsuperscript {rd} place in the second task. Our method is based on the XLM-RoBERTa model that is pre-trained from a large amount of unlabeled corpus before  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
