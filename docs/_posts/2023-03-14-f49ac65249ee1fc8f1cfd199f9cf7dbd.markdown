The proliferation of false and erroneous information on the Internet has posed a challenge to the accurate exchange of information. To address this issue, a semisupervised system based on self-embedding has been proposed. This system verifies information before it is shared, allowing only reliable and accurate content to be disseminated and protecting individuals from the negative effects of false information. In this article, we present a news article retrieval model based on active  Cites: A language-independent neural network for event detection
