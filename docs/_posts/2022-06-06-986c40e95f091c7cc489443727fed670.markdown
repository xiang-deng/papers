Building autonomous artificial agents able to grow open-ended repertoires of skills is one of the fundamental goals of AI. To that end, a promising developmental approach recommends the design of intrinsically motivated agents that learn new skills by generating and pursuing their own goals-autotelic agents. However, existing algorithms still show serious limitations in terms of goal diversity, exploration, generalization or skill composition. This perspective calls for the immersion of
