While large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3, appear to be robust and general, their reasoning ability is not at a level to compete with the best models trained for specific natural language reasoning problems. In this work, we observe that a large language model could serve as a highly effective few-shot semantic parser that turns natural language sentences into a logical form that can be used as input to answer set programs, a logic-based declarative knowledge representation  Cites: Learning reasoning strategies in end-to-end differentiable proving
