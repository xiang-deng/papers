The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a rapidly growing  infodemic of health information online. This has motivated the need for accurate semantic search and retrieval of reliable COVID-19 information across millions of documents, in multiple languages. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel high precision and high recall neural Multistage BiCross encoder approach. It is a sequential three-stage ranking pipeline which uses the Okapi BM25 retrieval Cites: Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering
