The goal of relation classification (RC) is to extract the semantic relations between/among entities in the text. As a fundamental task in natural language processing, it is crucial to ensure the robustness of RC models. Despite the high accuracy current deep neural models have achieved in RC tasks, they are easily affected by spurious correlations. One solution to this problem is to train the model with counterfactually augmented data (CAD) such that it can learn the causation Cites: Polyjuice: Generating Counterfactuals for Explaining, Evaluating
