Abstract Knowledge graph representation learning (KGRL) aims to infer the missing links between target entities based on existing triples. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been introduced recently as one of the latest trendy architectures serves KGRL task using aggregations of neighborhood information. However, current GNN-based methods have fundamental limitations in both modelling the multi-hop distant neighbors and selecting relation-specific neighborhood information from vast …
