In the field of optics, precise control of light with arbitrary spatial resolution has long been a sought-after goal. Freeform nanophotonic devices are critical building blocks for achieving this goal, as they provide access to a design potential that could hardly be achieved by conventional fixed-shape devices. However, finding an optimal device structure in the vast combinatorial design space that scales exponentially with the number of freeform design parameters has been an enormous challenge.
