Developing materials with good properties has both scientific and economic value. For example, information technology relies on the continuous innovation of many materials such as semiconductors, dielectric, magnetic, and optical materials; the goal of carbon neutrality depends on breakthroughs in energy storage and transportation technologies. Today, the design of new materials usually involves the prediction and synthesis of new inorganic compounds. In the last thirty years, the
