While large neural-based conversational models have become increasingly proficient as dialogue agents, recent work has highlighted safety issues with these systems. For example, these systems can be goaded into generating toxic content, which often perpetuates social biases or stereotypes. We investigate a retrieval-based framework for reducing bias and toxicity in responses generated from neural-based chatbots. It uses in-context learning to steer a model towards safer Cites: Evaluating the impact of model scale for compositional
