Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a non-invasive approach to measure the maximum oxygen uptake (V˙ O 2− max), which is an index to assess cardiovascular fitness (CF). However, CPET is not available to all populations and cannot be obtained continuously. Thus, wearable sensors are associated with machine learning (ML) algorithms to investigate CF. Therefore, this study aimed to predict CF by using ML algorithms using data obtained by wearable technologies. For this …
