ABSTRACT Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are designed to help developers build software more effectively. Recommending the right APIs for specific tasks is gaining increasing attention among researchers and developers. However, most of the existing approaches are mainly evaluated for general programming tasks using statically typed programming languages such as Java. Little is known about their practical effectiveness and usefulness for machine learning (ML) programming  Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
