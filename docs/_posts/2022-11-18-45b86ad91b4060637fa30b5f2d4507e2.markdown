Machine reading comprehension (MRC) is a challenging task in the field of artificial intelligence. Most existing MRC works contain a semantic matching module, either explicitly or intrinsically, to determine whether a piece of context answers a question. However, there is scant work which systematically evaluates different paradigms using semantic matching in MRC. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study on semantic matching. We formulate a twostage framework which consists of a  Cites: Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research
