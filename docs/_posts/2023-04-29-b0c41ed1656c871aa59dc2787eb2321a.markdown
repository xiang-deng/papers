This study presents a hybrid keyword extraction method called SkyWords. It implements a novel supervised step based on the skyline operator and the majority voting principle for high-quality candidate keyword selection and an unsupervised step based on contextual semantics for the candidate keyword ranking. To achieve this, firstly, we build a feature vector database using the features of known keywords and then apply the skyline operator to retrieve the dominating feature vectors.
