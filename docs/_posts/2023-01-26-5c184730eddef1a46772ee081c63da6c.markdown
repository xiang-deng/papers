The present work explores computer-assisted simultaneous interpreting (CASI) from a primarily cognitive perspective. Despite concerns over the potentially negative impact of computer-assisted interpreting (CAI) tools on interpreters  cognitive load (CL), this hypothesis has thus far remained untested. Furthermore, previous research has been restricted to the evaluation of the CASI product. Hence, a methodology for the process-oriented evaluation of CASI and the empirical evidence for its cognitive …
