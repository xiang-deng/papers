This thesis focuses on the advancement of probabilistic logic programming (PLP), which combines probability theory for uncertainty and logic programming for relations. The thesis aims to extend PLP to support both discrete and continuous random variables, which is necessary for applications with numeric data. The first contribution is the introduction of context-specific likelihood weighting (CS-LW), a new sampling algorithm that exploits context-specific independencies for …
