This paper presents a classification method to classify different marine floating small targets, which can realize effective classification of different targets in strong clutter background. The design of proposed classiffication method is primarily based on block-whitened time-frequency spectrogram and pre-trained convolution neural network (CNN). Block whitening clutter suppression is used to process target echoes. By converting a strong clutter background to an approximately noise background, the …
