In this work, we propose a robust framework that employs adversarially robust training to safeguard the machine learning models against perturbed testing data. We achieve this by incorporating the worst-case additive adversarial error within a fixed budget for each sample during model estimation. Our main focus is to provide a plug-and-play solution that can be incorporated in the existing machine learning algorithms with minimal changes. To that end, we derive the closed-form ready-to Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
