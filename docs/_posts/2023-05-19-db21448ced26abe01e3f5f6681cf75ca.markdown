Quantum random-access memory (QRAM) is a mechanism to access data (quantum or classical) based on addresses which are themselves a quantum state. QRAM has a long and controversial history, and here we survey and expand arguments and constructions for and against. We use two primary categories of QRAM from the literature:(1) active, which requires external intervention and control for each QRAM query (eg the error-corrected circuit model), and (2) passive, which requires no  Cites: Llm. int8 (): 8-bit matrix multiplication for transformers at scale
