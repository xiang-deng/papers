The deep learning methods based on syntactic dependency tree have achieved great success on Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). However, the accuracy of the dependency parser cannot be determined, which may keep aspect words away from its related opinion words in a dependency tree. Moreover, few models incorporate external affective knowledge for ABSA. Based on this, we propose a novel architecture to tackle the above two limitations, while fills up the gap in …
