Document-level event argument extraction (DEAE) aims to identify the arguments corresponding to the roles of a given event type in a document. However, arguments scattering and arguments and roles overlapping make DEAE face great challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel DEAE model called Role Knowledge Prompting for Document-Level Event Argument Extraction (RKDE), which enhances the interaction between templates and roles through a role knowledge guidance mechanism to  Cites: A language-independent neural network for event detection
