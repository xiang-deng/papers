As data size and computing power increase, the architectures of deep neural networks (DNNs) have been getting more complex and huge, and thus there is a growing need to simplify such complex and huge DNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse Bayesian neural network (BNN) which searches a good DNN with an appropriate complexity. We employ the masking variables at each node which can turn off some nodes according to the posterior distribution to yield a nodewise sparse
