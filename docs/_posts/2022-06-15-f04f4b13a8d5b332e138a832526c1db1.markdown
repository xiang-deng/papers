Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its success in handling the statistical heterogeneity of FL clients via utilizing and deploying distinct local models. However, standardized evaluation and systematical analysis of diverse pFL methods remain a challenge. Firstly, the highly varied datasets, FL simulation settings and pFL implementations impede the fast and fair pFL comparison. Secondly, the effectiveness and robustness of pFL methods are Cites: Well-Read Students Learn Better: On the Importance of Pre
