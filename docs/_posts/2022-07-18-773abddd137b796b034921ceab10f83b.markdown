Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) are two principal subtasks of knowledge-based systems that extract meaningful information from unstructured text. With Recent advances in Deep Learning techniques, new models use Joint Named Entities and Relation Extraction (JNERE) techniques that simultaneously accomplish NER and RE subtasks. These models avoid the drawbacks of using the traditional pipeline method. As contributions of our study to …
