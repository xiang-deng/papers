Knowledge graphs are important in human-centered AI because of their ability to reduce the need for large labelled machine-learning datasets, facilitate transfer learning, and generate explanations. However, knowledge-graph construction has evolved into a complex, semi-automatic process that increasingly relies on opaque deep-learning models and vast collections of heterogeneous data sources to scale. The knowledge-graph lifecycle is not transparent, accountability is limited, and there …
