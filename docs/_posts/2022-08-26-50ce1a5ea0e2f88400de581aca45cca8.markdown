Discovering the semantic relationships among heterogeneous ontologies has been one of the core research topics in Semantic Web. As ontology matching systems inevitably adopt heuristic strategies, wrong mappings are often contained in final alignments. Most methods for mapping revision depend on dealing with logical incoherence. However, erroneous mappings that do not cause incoherence may be left out. Hence, manual validations with domain expertise are needed. Nevertheless Cites: Introduction to statistical relational learning
