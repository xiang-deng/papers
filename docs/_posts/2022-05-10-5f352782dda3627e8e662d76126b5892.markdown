In this paper, we propose a method that incorporates cross-lingual word embedding similarity and degree of co-occurrence in parallel sentences to automate the process of recognizing interlingual homographs. We conduct experiments with multiple word embedding models and different co-occurrence metrics in both Chinese-Japanese and English-Dutch language pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is able to produce accurate and consistent predictions across Cites: Cross-lingual Alignment vs Joint Training: A Comparative Study
