Research into the detection of human activities from wearable sensors is a highly active field, benefiting numerous applications, from ambulatory monitoring of healthcare patients via fitness coaching to streamlining manual work processes. We present an empirical study that compares 4 different commonly used annotation methods utilized in user studies that focus on in-the-wild data. These methods can be grouped in user-driven, in situ annotations-which are performed before or during the …
