Considering that converting linear ordinal ranking (LOR) information into interval utility values can not only improve the computability of LOR information but also explore the degree of preference for different alternatives for decision-makers hidden behind LOR information, this paper proposes a conversion-based LOR aggregation method to aggregate LOR information under risk. Given that the behaviours of decision-makers are influenced by risk, this paper adopts prospect theory to depict  Cites: Unsupervised rank aggregation with distance-based models
