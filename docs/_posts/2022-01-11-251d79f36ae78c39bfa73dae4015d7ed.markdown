This paper presents a CNN-based fully unsupervised method for motion segmentation from optical flow. We assume that the input optical flow can be represented as a piecewise set of parametric motion models, typically, affine or quadratic motion models. The core idea of this work is to leverage the Expectation- Maximization (EM) framework. It enables us to design in a well-founded manner the loss function and the training procedure of our motion segmentation neural network Cites: A framework for contrastive self-supervised learning and designing
