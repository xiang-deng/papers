Domain generation algorithms (DGAs) play an important role in network attacks and can be mainly divided into two types: dictionary-based and character-based. Dictionary-based algorithmically generated domains (AGDs) are similar in composition to normal domains and are harder to detect. Although methods based on meaningful word segmentation and n-gram sequence features exhibit good detection performance for AGDs, they are inadequate for mining meaningful word …
