Identifying and extracting valuable information from textual documents in the form of cohesively and appropriately developed summaries is one of the most challenging tasks in text mining and natural language processing. In this article, we present a sequential Markov model, equipped with Bayesian inference, to estimate the degree of importance of sentences in a document and thereby address the text summarisation problem. The proposed methodology models the extractive sentence  Cites: Neural Extractive Text Summarization with Syntactic Compression
