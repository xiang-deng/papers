As an emerging technology, therapeutic cell manufacturing faces major challenges in three aspects: knowledge gap, regulations, and case-to-case variability. Among all variability sources, donor-to-donor variability is intrinsic to therapeutic cell manufacturing and can be very large. A few recent articles have addressed this variability, but enormous research opportunities remain. In this opinion paper, we focus on the donor-to-donor variability and point out a new sub-field in the data Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
