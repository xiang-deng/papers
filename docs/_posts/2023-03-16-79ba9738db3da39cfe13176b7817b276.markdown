Multi-hop question answering is the question answering that requires understanding and reasoning over multiple documents to find answers. In this work, we focus on improving language model pretraining to achieve better performance on downstream multi-hop question answering. We develop MixLinkBERT, a language model pretrained with multiple types of linked documents. We show that MixLinkBERT outperforms BERT and LinkBERT on HotpotQA.
