Recent studies have increasingly applied machine learning (ML) to aid in performance and material design associated with membrane separation. However, whether the knowledge attained by ML with a limited number of available data is enough to capture and validate the fundamental principles of membrane science remains elusive. Herein, we applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to thoroughly investigate the knowledge learned by ML on the mechanisms of ion  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
