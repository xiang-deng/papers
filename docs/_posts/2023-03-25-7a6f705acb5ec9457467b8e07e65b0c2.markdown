Interpreting and debugging machine learning models is necessary to ensure the robustness of the machine learning models. Explaining mispredictions can help significantly in doing so. While recent works on misprediction explanation have proven promising in generating interpretable explanations for mispredictions, the state-of-the-art techniques blindly deduce misprediction explanation rules from all data features, which may not be scalable depending on the number of features.
