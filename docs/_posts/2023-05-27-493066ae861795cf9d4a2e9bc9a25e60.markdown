Context-aware neural machine translation involves leveraging information beyond sentence-level context to resolve inter-sentential discourse dependencies and improve document-level translation quality, and has given rise to a number of recent techniques. However, despite well-reasoned intuitions, most context-aware translation models show only modest improvements over sentence-level systems. In this work, we investigate several challenges that impede progress within this field  Cites: Modeling Context With Linear Attention for Scalable Document
