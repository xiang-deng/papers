Stance detection (SD) can be considered a special case of textual entailment recognition (TER), a generic natural language task. Modelling SD as TER may offer benefits like more training data and a more general learning scheme. In this paper, we present an initial empirical analysis of this approach. We apply it to a difficult but relevant test case where no existing labelled SD dataset is available, because this is where modelling SD as TER may be especially helpful. We also leverage  Cites: Benchmarking zero-shot text classification: Datasets, evaluation
