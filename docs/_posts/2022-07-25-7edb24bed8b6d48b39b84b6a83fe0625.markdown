Hypergraph learning is largely used to handle dimensional disaster problem of high-dimensional data in view of its flexible ability to model complex data correlations. However, the following three problems limit the performance of unsupervised hypergraph-based dimensionality reduction methods:(1) most of them are unable to obtain consistently good performance for different data sets;(2) noise or outliers in the data can lead to unreliability of the fixed hypergraph; and (3) the simple K Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
