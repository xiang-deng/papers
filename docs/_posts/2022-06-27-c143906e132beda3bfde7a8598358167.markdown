OpenAI Codex is a recent large language model from the GPT-3 family for translating code into natural language and vice versa. Recent explorations of Codex have highlighted that given typical introductory programming exercise problem statements as input, the model can generate code solutions well above the level of an average student. In this article, we explore the natural language generation capabilities of Codex in two different phases of the life of a programming exercise; automatically Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
