Uncovering rationales behind predictions of graph neural networks (GNNs) has received increasing attention over recent years. Instance-level GNN explanation aims to discover critical input elements, like nodes or edges, that the target GNN relies upon for making predictions.% These identified sub-structures can provide interpretations of GNN s behavior. Though various algorithms are proposed, most of them formalize this task by searching the minimal subgraph which can preserve …
