Machine learning (ML) over tabular data has become ubiquitous with applications in many domains. This success has led to the rise of ML platforms, including automated ML (AutoML) platforms to manage the end-to-end ML workflow. The tedious grunt work involved in data preparation (prep) reduces data scientist productivity and slows down the ML development lifecycle, which makes the automation of data prep even more critical. While many works have looked into feature engineering and Cites: Foofah: A programming-by-example system for synthesizing data
