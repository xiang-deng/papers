Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) extracts relational fact tuples in the form of< subject, relation, object> from text. Most existing OpenIE solutions operate at sentence level and extract relational tuples solely from a sentence. However, many sentences exist as a part of paragraph or a document, where coreferencing is common. In this demonstration, we present a system which refines the semantic tuples generated by OpenIE with the aid of a coreference resolution tool.
