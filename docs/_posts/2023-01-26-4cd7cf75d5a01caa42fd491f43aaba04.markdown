Embeddings or vector representations of language and their properties are useful for under-standing how Natural Language Processing technology works. The usefulness of embeddings, however, depends on how contextualized or information-rich such embeddings are. In this work, I apply a novel affine (linear) mapping technique first established in the field of computer vision to embeddings generated from large Transformer-based language models. In particular, I study its use in two …
