Language models (LMs) often generate incoherent outputs: they refer to events and entity states that are incompatible with the state of the world described in their inputs. We introduce SituationSupervision, a family of approaches for improving coherence in LMs by training them to construct and condition on explicit representations of entities and their states. SituationSupervision has two components: an auxiliary situation modeling task that trains models to predict state representations in context …
