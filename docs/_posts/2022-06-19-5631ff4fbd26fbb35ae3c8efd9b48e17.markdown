A ranker plays an indispensable role in the de facto retrieval & rerank pipeline, but its training still lags behind--learning from moderate negatives or/and serving as an auxiliary module for a retriever. In this work, we first identify two major barriers to a robust ranker, ie, inherent label noises caused by a well-trained retriever and non-ideal negatives sampled for a high-capable ranker. Thereby, we propose multiple retrievers as negative generators improve the ranker s robustness, where i) involving  Cites: Sparse, dense, and attentional representations for text retrieval
