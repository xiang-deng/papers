The unique properties of porous metal-organic frameworks are responsible for the increasing research interest in the design and synthesis of this type of materials. A general strategy towards targeted design of metal-organic frameworks possessing desired properties is a choice of optimal linkers, which are usually represented by polytopic organic ligands. Porphyrins are promising building blocks for such frameworks due to their tunable physicochemical properties and wide possibilities of Cites: Theoretical limits of hydrogen storage in metalorganic
