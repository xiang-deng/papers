One of the critical hurdles, and breakthroughs, in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the last two decades has been the development of techniques for text representation that solves the so-called curse of dimensionality, a problem which plagues NLP in general given that the feature set for learning starts as a function of the size of the language in question, upwards of hundreds of thousands of terms typically. As such, much of the research and development in NLP in the last …
