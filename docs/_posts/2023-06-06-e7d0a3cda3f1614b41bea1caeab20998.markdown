Some hazardous gases, like toluene vapor, have caused serious environmental pollution. The adsorption of toluene using metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has been considered a useful mechanism to reduce environmental pollution. High-throughput computation using the grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) approach was used to screen high-performance MOFs from the CoRE MOF database. A total of 802 MOFs are selected with a toluene uptake larger than HKUST-1 (6.34 mmol/g at …
