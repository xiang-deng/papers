Modern machine learning models are opaque, and as a result there is a burgeoning academic subfield on methods that explain these models behavior. However, what is the precise goal of providing such explanations, and how can we demonstrate that explanations achieve this goal? Some research argues that explanations should help teach a student (either human or machine) to simulate the model being explained, and that the quality of explanations can be measured by the simulation Cites: Generalized inner loop meta-learning
