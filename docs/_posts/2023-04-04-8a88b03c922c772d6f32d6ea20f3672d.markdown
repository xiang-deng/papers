The prosperity of knowledge graphs (KG), as well as related downstream applications, have raised the urgent request of knowledge graph completion techniques for fully supporting the KG reasoning tasks, especially under the circumstance of training data scarcity. Though large efforts have been made on solving this challenge via few-shot learning tools, they mainly focus on simply aggregating entity neighbors to represent few-shot references, while the  Cites: Complex embeddings for simple link prediction
