Abstract Machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are increasingly used in energy and engineering systems, but these models must be fair, unbiased, and explainable. In other words, it is crucial to have confidence in AI s trustworthiness. Machine learning techniques, like neural networks, have helped predict important parameters and improve model performance. But for these AI techniques to be useful for making decisions, they need to be audited, accounted for, and easy to  Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
