Curated knowledge bases (KBs) contain billions of facts with millions of entities and thousands of predicates. Question answering (QA) systems are supposed to access this knowledge to answer users factoid questions. Entity linking and relation linking are integral ingredients of many such QA systems, and aim to link mentions in the question to concepts in the KB. The quality of these linking modules is of high importance: a single error in linking can result in a failure for the whole QA system Cites: S-MART: Novel Tree-based Structured Learning Algorithms
