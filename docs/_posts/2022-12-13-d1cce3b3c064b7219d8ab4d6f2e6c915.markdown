The growth of data in volume and complexity needs automatic tools to manage and process information. Semantic Web Technologies are a silver bullet in this context due to their capacity to transform human-readable contents into machine-readable ones. Knowledge graphs and the related ontologies represent essential tools for managing very large knowledge bases. The population process of these knowledge structures is composed of expensive and time-consuming tasks, and we propose a  Cites: Web-scale information extraction in knowitall: (preliminary results)
