Abstract Machine learning (ML) has been recognized by researchers in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry but undermined in practice by (i) complex processes relying on data expertise and (ii) untrustworthy  black box models. As a result, ML results of complex non-linear AEC problems, such as the failure mechanism of reinforced concrete (RC) shear walls, are not comparable with empirical and mechanics-based models. This paper aims to …
