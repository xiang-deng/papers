Learning from noisy labels plays an important role in the deep learning era. Despite numerous studies with promising results, identifying clean labels from a noisily-annotated dataset is still challenging since the conventional noisy label learning problem with single noisy label per instance is not identifiable, ie, it does not theoretically have a unique solution unless one has access to clean labels or introduces additional assumptions. This paper aims to formally investigate such Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
