Intent discovery is a fundamental task in NLP, and it is increasingly relevant for a variety of industrial applications (Quarteroni 2018). The main challenge resides in the need to identify from input utterances novel unseen in-tents. Herein, we propose Z-BERT-A, a two-stage method for intent discovery relying on a Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. 2017; Devlin et al. 2018), fine-tuned with Adapters (Pfeiffer et al. 2020), initially trained for Natural Language Inference (NLI), and later Cites: Adapterhub: A framework for adapting transformers
