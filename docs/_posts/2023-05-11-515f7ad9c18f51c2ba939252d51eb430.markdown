This paper presents Squid, a new conjunctive query synthesis algorithm for searching code with target patterns. Given positive and negative examples along with a natural language description, Squid analyzes the relations derived from the examples by a Datalog-based program analyzer and synthesizes a conjunctive query expressing the search intent. The synthesized query can be further used to search for desired grammatical constructs in the editor.
