In this work we explore confidence elicitation methods for crowdsourcing  soft labels, eg, probability estimates, to reduce the annotation costs for domains with ambiguous data. Machine learning research has shown that such  soft  labels are more informative and can reduce the data requirements when training supervised machine learning models. By reducing the number of required labels, we can reduce the costs of slow annotation processes such as audio annotation. In our experiments Cites: Exact exponent in optimal rates for crowdsourcing
