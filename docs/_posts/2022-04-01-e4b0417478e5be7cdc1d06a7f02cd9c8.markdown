Bioinformatic annotation of protein function is essential but extremely sophisticated, which asks for extensive efforts to develop effective prediction method. However, the existing methods tend to amplify the representativeness of the families with large number of proteins by misclassifying the proteins in the families with small number of proteins. That is to say, the ability of the existing methods to annotate proteins in the rare classes  remains limited. Herein, a new protein function annotation strategy Cites: Structure-based protein function prediction using graph
