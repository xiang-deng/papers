Conventional document retrieval techniques are mainly based on the index-retrieve paradigm. It is challenging to optimize pipelines based on this paradigm in an end-to-end manner. As an alternative, generative retrieval represents documents as identifiers (docid) and retrieves documents by generating docids, enabling end-to-end modeling of document retrieval tasks. However, it is an open question how one should define the document identifiers. Current approaches to the task of defining  Cites: Large dual encoders are generalizable retrievers
