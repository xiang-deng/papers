Developing automatic Math Word Problem (MWP) solvers is a challenging task that demands the ability of understanding and mathematical reasoning over the natural language. Recent neural-based approaches mainly encode the problem text using a language model and decode a mathematical expression over quantities and operators iteratively. Note the problem text of a MWP consists of a context part and a question part, a recent work finds these neural solvers may only perform shallow …
