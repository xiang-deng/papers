Typical financial documents consist of tables, texts, and numbers. Given sufficient training data, large language models (LM) can learn the tabular structures and perform numerical reasoning well in question answering (QA). However, their performances fall significantly when data and computational resources are limited. This study improves this performance drop by infusing explicit tabular structures through a graph neural network (GNN). We proposed a model developed from the Cites: Autoregressive entity retrieval
