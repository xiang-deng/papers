Non-negative tensor decomposition has achieved significant success in machine learning due to its superiority in extracting the non-negative parts-based features and physically meaningful latent components from high-order data. To improve its representation ability, hypergraph has been incorporated into the tensor decomposition model to capture the nonlinear manifold structure of data. However, previous hypergraph regularized tensor decomposition methods rely on the original Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
