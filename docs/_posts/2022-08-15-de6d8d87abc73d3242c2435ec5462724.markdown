Programming Language Processing (PLP) using machine learning has made vast improvements in the past few years. Increasingly more people are interested in exploring this promising field. However, it is challenging for new researchers and developers to find the right components to construct their own machine learning pipelines, given the diverse PLP tasks to be solved, the large number of datasets and models being released, and the set of complex compilers or tools involved.
