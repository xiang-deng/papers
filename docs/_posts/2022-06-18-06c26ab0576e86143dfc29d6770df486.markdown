Current deep learning approaches have shown good in-distribution generalization performance, but struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. This is especially true in the case of tasks involving abstract relations like recognizing rules in sequences, as we find in many intelligence tests. Recent work has explored how forcing relational representations to remain distinct from sensory representations, as it seems to be the case in the brain, can help artificial systems.
