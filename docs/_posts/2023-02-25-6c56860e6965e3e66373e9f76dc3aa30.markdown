The development of annotated datasets over the 21st century has helped us truly realize the power of deep learning. Most of the datasets created for the named-entity-recognition (NER) task are not domain specific. Finance domain presents specific challenges to the NER task and a domain specific dataset would help push the boundaries of finance research. In our work, we develop the first high-quality NER dataset for the finance domain. To set the benchmark for the dataset, we develop and  Cites: Stanza: A python natural language processing toolkit for many
