Unsupervised graph embedding aims to extract highly discriminative node representations that facilitate the subsequent analysis. Converging evidence shows that a multiview graph provides a more comprehensive relationship between nodes than a single-view graph to capture the intrinsic topology. However, little attention has been paid to excavating discriminative representations of each node from multiview heterogeneous networks in an unsupervised manner. To that end, we Cites: Glove: Global vectors for word representation
