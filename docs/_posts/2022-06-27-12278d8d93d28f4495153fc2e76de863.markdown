Advancements in hypothetical metal-organic framework (hMOF) databases and construction tools have resulted in a rapidly expanding chemical design space for nanoporous materials. The bulk of these hypothetical structures are constructed using structural building units (SBUs) derived from experimental MOF structures, often collected from the CoRE-MOF database. Recent investigations into the state of these deposited experimental structures  chemical accuracy identified an array of  Cites: Theoretical limits of hydrogen storage in metalorganic
