We designed the prediction system for the rolling contact fatigue (RCF) performance of martensitic steel based on the machine learning (ML) algorithm and micro-mechanical simulations. The emphasis here is not only to propose a low-cost micromechanics-based ML prediction system, but also to establish the linkage between microstructure features and RCF responses. In this prediction system, the hierarchical microstructure modeling approach and size-dependent physics-based …
