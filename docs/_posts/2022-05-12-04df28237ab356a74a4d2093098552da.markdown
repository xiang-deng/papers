Blind image quality assessment (BIQA), which is capable of precisely and automatically estimating human perceived image quality with no pristine image for comparison, attracts extensive attention and is of wide applications. Recently, many existing BIQA methods commonly represent image quality with a quantitative value, which is inconsistent with human cognition. Generally, human beings are good at perceiving image quality in terms of semantic description rather than quantitative Cites: Babytalk: Understanding and generating simple image descriptions
