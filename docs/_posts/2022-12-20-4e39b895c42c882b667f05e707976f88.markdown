Text classification, a core component of task-oriented dialogue systems, attracts continuous research from both the research and industry community, and has resulted in tremendous progress. However, existing method does not consider the use of label information, which may weaken the performance of text classification systems in some token-aware scenarios. To address the problem, in this paper, we introduce the use of label information as label embedding for the task of text …
