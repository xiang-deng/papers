Existing deep learning approaches for person re-identification (Re-ID) mostly rely on large-scale and well-annotated training data. However, human-annotated labels are prone to label noise in real-world applications. Previous person Re-ID works mainly focus on random label noise, which doesn t properly reflect the characteristic of label noise in practical human-annotated process. In this work, we find the visual ambiguity noise is more common and reasonable noise assumption in annotation of Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
