Event detection on networks is an important research task in data mining. Most previous approaches usually detect a particular type of event that satisfies the predefined rules in the model, ie, data-driven methods. However, few methods consider the diverse interests of multiple experts during the detection process to discover unexplored events. In this paper, we regard interactive event detection on attributed networks as Multi-users Interaction Anomalous Subgraph Detection Cites: Event detection and co-reference with minimal supervision
