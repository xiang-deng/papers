While many mainstream languages such as Java, Python, and C# increasingly incorporate functional APIs to simplify programming and improve parallelization/ performance, there are no effective techniques that can be used to automatically translate existing imperative code to functional variants using these APIs. Motivated by this problem, this paper presents a transpilation approach based on inductive program synthesis for modernizing existing code. Our method is based on the Cites: Web question answering with neurosymbolic program synthesis
