Research on improving the robustness of neural networks to adversarial noiseimperceptible malicious perturbations of the data-has received significant attention. Neural nets struggle to recognize corrupted images that are easily recognized by humans. The currently uncontested state-of-the-art defence to obtain robust deep neural networks is Adversarial Training (AT), but it consumes significantly more resources compared to standard training and trades off accuracy …
