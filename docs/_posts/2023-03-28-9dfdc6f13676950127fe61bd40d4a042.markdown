New retrieval tasks have always been emerging, thus urging the development of new retrieval models. However, instantiating a retrieval model for each new retrieval task is resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially for a retrieval model that employs a large-scale pre-trained language model. To address this issue, we shift to a novel retrieval paradigm called modular retrieval, which aims to solve new retrieval tasks by instead composing multiple existing retrieval modules. Built upon the …
