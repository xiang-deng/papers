Ionic liquids (ILs) are promising electrolytes or solvents for numerous applications owing to their unique properties. However, it is a challenge to design the ideal IL with the required properties. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) trained by significantly large datasets have shown good performance in drug discovery. However, low generation efficiency and small sparse datasets prevent their application on IL. In this work, we propose a high generation efficiency molecular design model for IL, which Cites: Conditional molecular design with deep generative models
