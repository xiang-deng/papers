This study proposes a novel approach for measuring political polarization using a user-activity-based model. By exploiting data from comments, user activity in this study is defined based on features such as coverage, duration, and enthusiasm. To determine these features, we collect information on the activities of users from South Korean YouTube channels. Notably, the collected data of the model contains approximately 11 M comments from more than 600 K users based on 37 K videos of Cites: Leveraging Tagging to Model User Interests in del. icio. us.
