Distant supervision neural relation extraction is used to classify the relation labels of instance bags with the same head-tail entity. Since there are usually multirelation labels in an entity pair, intensive noise occurs in the instance bag. Recent works mostly focused on developing an attention mechanism to degrade the weights of some sentences whose ground-truth relation labels are different from the instance bag. However, the general weakness is the failure to explore the semantic  Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
