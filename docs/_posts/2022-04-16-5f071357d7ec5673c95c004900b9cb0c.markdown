This paper contributes with a pragmatic evaluation framework for explainable Machine Learning (ML) models for clinical decision support.

Despite the general positive attitude of healthcare professionals (HCPs) towards explanations as a safety and trust mechanism, for a significant set of participants there were negative effects associated with confirmation Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
