Abstract Nowadays, Machine Learning (ML) techniques play an increasingly important role in educational settings such as behavioral academic pattern recognition, educational resources suggestion, competences and skills prediction, or clustering students with similar learning characteristics, among others. Knowledge Tracing (KT) allows modelling the learner s mastery of skills and to predict student s performance by tracking within the Learner Model (LM) the students knowledge Cites: Frustratingly short attention spans in neural language modeling
