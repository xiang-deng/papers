Named entity recognition (NER) is a key component of many natural language processing (NLP) applications. The majority of advanced research, however, has not been widely applied to low-resource languages represented by Malay due to the data-hungry problem. In this paper, we present a system for building a Malay NER dataset (MS-NER) of 20,146 sentences through labelled datasets of homologous languages and iterative optimisation. Additionally, we propose a M ulti-T ask Cites: Unsupervised named-entity extraction from the web: An
