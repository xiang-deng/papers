Table corpora such as VizNet or TURL which contain annotated semantic types per column are important to build machine learning models for the task of automatic semantic type detection. However, there is a huge discrepancy between corpora that are used for training and testing since real-world data lakes contain a huge fraction of numerical data which are not present in existing corpora. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a new corpus that contains a much higher proportion of numerical columns Cites: TURL: Table Understanding through Representation Learning
