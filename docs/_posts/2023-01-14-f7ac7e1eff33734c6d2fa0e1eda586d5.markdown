Traditionally, machine learning research has adopted methods that were designed to learn one or a set of machine learning tasks independently. However, motivated by our brain s learning mechanism to transfer knowledge from past and other related experiences, recent research has developed and studied methods incorporating target task relationships in the learning algorithms. The area of machine learning in which multiple target tasks are solved simultaneously while exploiting their …
