Applications build graphs in an ad-hoc fashion, usually tailored to specific use cases, limiting their reusability. To account for this, we present the Corpus Annotation Graph (CAG) architectural framework based on a create-and-annotate pattern that enables users to build uniformly structured graphs from diverse data sources and extend them with Cites: Multi-task identification of entities, relations, and coreference for
