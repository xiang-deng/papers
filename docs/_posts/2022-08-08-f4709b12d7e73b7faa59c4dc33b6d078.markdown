Rapid fire progression, such as flashover, has been one of the leading causes for firefighter deaths and injuries in residential building environments. Due to long computational time of and the required prior knowledge about the fire scene, existing models cannot be used to predict the potential occurrence of flashover in practical firefighting applications. In this paper, a scene-agnostic model (FlashNet) is proposed to predict flashover based on limited heat detector temperature information Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
