This paper uses information-theoretic tools to analyze the generalization error in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We present novel upper bounds for two notions of generalization errors. The first notion measures the gap between the population risk in the target domain and that in the source domain, and the second measures the gap between the population risk in the target domain and the empirical risk in the source domain. While our bounds for the first kind of error are in line with Cites: Catastrophic fisher explosion: Early phase fisher matrix impacts
