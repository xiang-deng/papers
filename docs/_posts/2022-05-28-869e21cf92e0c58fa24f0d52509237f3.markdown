Several recent works have suggested to represent semantic relations with questions and answers, decomposing textual information into separate interrogative natural language statements. In this paper, we consider three QA-based semantic tasks-namely, QA-SRL, QANom and QADiscourse, each targeting a certain type of predication-and propose to regard them as jointly providing a comprehensive representation of textual information. To promote this goal, we investigate how to Cites: Efficiently Summarizing Text and Graph Encodings of Multi
