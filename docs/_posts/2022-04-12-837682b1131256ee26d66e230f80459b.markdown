Compilation into propositional languages finds a growing number of practical uses, including in constraint programming, diagnosis and machine learning (ML), among others. One concrete example is the use of propositional languages as classifiers, and one natural question is how to explain the predictions made. This paper shows that for classifiers represented with some of the best-known propositional languages, different kinds of explanations can be computed in polynomial time.
