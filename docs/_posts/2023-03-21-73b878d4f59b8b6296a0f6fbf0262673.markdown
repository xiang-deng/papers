Wild radish weeds have always been a persistent problem in agriculture due to their quick and undesirable spread. Therefore, the accurate identification and effective control of wild radish in canola crops at early growth stage play an indispensable role in reducing herbicide rates and enhancing agricultural productivity. In this paper, an energy efficient and lightweight AkidaNet model is developed to accurately identify broad-leaf weeds and crops with similar morphology at four different growth Cites: ESPNetv2: A Light-weight, Power Efficient, and General Purpose
