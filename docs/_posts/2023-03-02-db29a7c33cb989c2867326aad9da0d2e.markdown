Recently, contrastive learning has found impressive success in advancing the state of the art in solving various machine learning tasks. However, the existing generalization analysis is very limited or even not meaningful. In particular, the existing generalization error bounds depend linearly on the number $ k $ of negative examples while it was widely shown in practice that choosing a large $ k $ is necessary to guarantee good generalization of contrastive learning in downstream  Cites: Provable Stochastic Optimization for Global Contrastive Learning
