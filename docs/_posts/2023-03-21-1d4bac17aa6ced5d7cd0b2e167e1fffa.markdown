Contextual models like BERT are highly effective in numerous text-ranking tasks. However, it is still unclear as to whether contextual models understand well-established notions of relevance that are central to IR. In this paper, we use probing, a recent approach used to analyze language models, to investigate the ranking abilities of BERT-based rankers. Most of the probing literature has focussed on linguistic and knowledge-aware capabilities of models or axiomatic analysis of …
