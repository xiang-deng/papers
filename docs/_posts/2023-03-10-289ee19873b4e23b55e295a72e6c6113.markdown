Given a huge, online stream of time-evolving events with multiple attributes, such as online shopping logs:(item, price, brand, time), and local mobility activities:(pick-up and drop-off locations, time), how can we summarize large, dynamic high-order tensor streams? How can we see any hidden patterns, rules, and anomalies? Our answer is to focus on two types of patterns, ie, regimes and components , for which we present CubeScope, an efficient and effective method over high-order tensor Cites: Deep state-space generative model for correlated time-to-event
