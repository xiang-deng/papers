Abstract Information Retrieval (IR) provides access to unstructured data to satisfy user information needs within an extensive collection. In probabilistic IR models, the probability of an N-gram query is estimated by increasing the background probabilities related to lower-order N-grams. Inspired by the N-gram smoothing approach, we propose a distributed transformer-based deep neural ranking model. The proposed model, called DSDNN (Distributed Smoothing Deep Neural Network) …
