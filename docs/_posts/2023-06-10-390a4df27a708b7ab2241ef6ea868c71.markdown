In the last few years, the natural language processing community witnessed advances in neural representations of free-form text with transformer-based language models (LMs). Given the importance of knowledge available in relational tables, recent research efforts extend LMs by developing neural representations for tabular data. In this tutorial, we present these proposals with three main goals. First, we aim at introducing the potentials and limitations of current models to a database  Cites: Database reasoning over text
