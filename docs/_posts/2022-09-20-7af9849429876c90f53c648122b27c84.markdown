Aspect-level sentiment analysis aims to identify the sentiment polarity of one or more aspect terms in a sentence. At present, many researchers have applied dependency trees and graph neural networks (GNNs) to aspect-level sentiment analysis and achieved promising results. However, when a sentence contains multiple aspects, most methods model each aspect independently, ignoring the issue of sentiment connection between aspects. To address this problem, this paper proposes a dual Cites: Aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network
