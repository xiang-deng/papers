The existence of label noise imposes significant challenges (eg, poor generalization) on the training process of deep neural networks (DNN). As a remedy, this paper introduces a permutation layer learning approach termed PermLL to dynamically calibrate the training process of the DNN subject to instance-dependent and instance-independent label noise. The proposed method augments the architecture of a conventional DNN by an instance-dependent permutation layer. This layer is  Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
