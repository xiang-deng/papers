Foundation models are used to train a broad system of general data to build adaptations to new bottlenecks. Typically, they contain hundreds of billions of hyperparameters that have been trained with hundreds of gigabytes of data. However, this type of black-box vulnerability places foundation models at risk of data poisoning attacks that are designed to pass on misinformation or purposely introduce machine bias. Moreover, ordinary researchers have not been able to completely Cites: Retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks
