Text representation of social media is an important task for users  sentiment analysis. Utilizing the better representation, we can accurately acquire the real semantic information expressed by online users. However, existing works cannot achieve the best results. In this paper, we construct and implement a sentiment analysis model based on the improved BERT and syntactic dependency. Firstly, by studying the word embeddings of BERT, we have ameliorated the embeddings representation Cites: Target-dependent sentiment classification with long short term
