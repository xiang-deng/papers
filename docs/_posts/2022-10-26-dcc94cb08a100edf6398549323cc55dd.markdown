Understanding rich narratives, such as dialogues and stories, often requires natural language processing systems to access relevant knowledge from commonsense knowledge graphs. However, these systems typically retrieve facts from KGs using simple heuristics that disregard the complex challenges of identifying situationally-relevant commonsense knowledge (eg, contextualization, implicitness, ambiguity). In this work, we propose the new task of commonsense fact linking, where models are Cites: GreaseLM: Graph REASoning Enhanced Language Models for
