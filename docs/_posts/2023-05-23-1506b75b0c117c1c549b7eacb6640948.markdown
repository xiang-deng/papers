Language models trained on large-scale corpora can generate remarkably fluent results in open-domain dialogue. However, for the persona-based dialogue generation task, consistency and coherence are also key factors, which are great challenges for language models. Existing works mainly focus on valuable data filtering, model structure modifying, or objective function designing, while their improvements are limited and hard to generalize to all types of pre-trained language …
