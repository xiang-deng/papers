Data scientists often have to use other presentation tools (eg, Microsoft PowerPoint) to create slides to communicate their analysis obtained using computational notebooks. Much tedious and repetitive work is needed to transfer the routines of notebooks (eg, code, plots) to the presentable contents on slides (eg, bullet points, figures). We propose a human-AI collaborative approach and operationalize it within Slide4N, an interactive AI assistant for data scientists to create slides from Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
