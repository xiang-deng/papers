In this paper machine learning and artificial neural network models are proposed for the classification of external noise sources affecting a given quantum dynamics. For this purpose, we train and then validate support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron and recurrent neural network models with different complexity and accuracy, to solve supervised binary classification problems. As a result, we demonstrate the high efficacy of such tools in classifying noisy quantum dynamics …
