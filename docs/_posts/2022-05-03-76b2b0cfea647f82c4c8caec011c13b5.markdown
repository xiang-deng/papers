Model-agnostic explainable AI tools explain their predictions by means of local feature contributions. We empirically investigate two potential improvements over current approaches. The first one is to always present feature contributions in terms of the contribution to the outcome that is perceived as positive by the user (positive framing). The second one is to add semantic labeling, that explains the directionality of each feature contribution (this feature leads to+ 5% eligibility) Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
