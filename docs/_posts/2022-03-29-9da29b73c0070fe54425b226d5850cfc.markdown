Training an effective image sentiment analysis model using high-quality samples and the implicit cross-modal semantics among heterogeneous features is still challenging. To address this problem, we propose an active sample refinement (ASR) strategy to obtain sufficient high-quality images with definite sentiment semantics. We mine the cluster correlation among the heterogeneous SENet features. Discriminative cross-modal semantics is generated to train an effective but Cites: Social sentiment sensor: a visualization system for topic detection
