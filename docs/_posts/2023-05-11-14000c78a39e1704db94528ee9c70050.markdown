With the explosive growth of textual information, summarization systems have become increasingly important. This work aims at indicating the current state of the art in abstractive text summarization concisely. As part of this, we outline the current paradigm shifts towards pre-trained encoder-decoder models and large autoregressive language models. Additionally, we delve further into the challenges of evaluating summarization systems and the potential of instruction-tuned models …
