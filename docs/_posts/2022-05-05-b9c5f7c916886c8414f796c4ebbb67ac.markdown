This study presents a formulation for generating context-aware natural language by machine from visual representation.

Previous works in this domain faced a problem in modeling an architecture that works in temporal multi-modal data, which led to a low- quality output, such as low lexical diversity, monotonous sentences, and inaccurate Cites: Fine-tuning pretrained language models: Weight initializations
