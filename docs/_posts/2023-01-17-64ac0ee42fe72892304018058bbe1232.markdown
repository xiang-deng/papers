In this article, we propose a joint extraction of entity–relation triplets in natural disaster cases based on word pair relation table filling. For computational accuracy concerns or other reasons, traditional works often do entity recognition and relation extraction separately; it might put less attention over the task connections and triplet global association. We propose the Global Table Attention GRU (GL-TGRU) model as a joint approach that uses sequence information encoding and table information …
