Abstract Multi-hop Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to find the answer entity via a reasoning path consisting of multiple fact triples in the knowledge graph (KG). Most of end-to-end KGQA approaches only pay attention to answering one-hop simple questions and lack scalability and interpretability. Meanwhile, since the high cost for data annotations, the lack of intermediate supervision signals becomes a major challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a policy  Cites: Semantic Parsing via Staged Query Graph Generation: Question
