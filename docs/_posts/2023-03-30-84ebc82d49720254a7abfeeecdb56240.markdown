The rapid progress of AI is fueled by increasingly large and computationally intensive machine learning models and datasets. As a consequence, the amount of compute used in training state-of-the-art models is exponentially increasing (doubling every 10 months between 2015 and 2022), resulting in a large carbon footprint. Federated Learning (FL)-a collaborative machine learning technique for training a centralized model using data of decentralized entities-can also be resource-intensive and have  Cites: The carbon footprint of machine learning training will plateau, then
