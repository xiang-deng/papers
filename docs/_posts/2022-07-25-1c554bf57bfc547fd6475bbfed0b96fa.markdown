Electrocatalysts and photocatalysts are key to a sustainable future, generating clean fuels, reducing the impact of global warming, and providing solutions to environmental pollution. Improved processes for catalyst design and a better understanding of electro/photocatalytic processes are essential for improving catalyst effectiveness. Recent advances in data science and artificial intelligence have great potential to accelerate electrocatalysis and photocatalysis research, particularly the  Cites: " Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any
