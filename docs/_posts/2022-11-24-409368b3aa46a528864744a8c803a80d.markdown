The success of deep learning depends on large-scale and well-curated training data, while data in real-world applications are commonly long-tailed and noisy. Many methods have been proposed to deal with long-tailed data or noisy data, while a few methods are developed to tackle long-tailed noisy data. To solve this, we propose a robust method for learning from long-tailed noisy data with sample selection and balanced loss. Specifically, we separate the noisy training data into clean labeled set  Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
