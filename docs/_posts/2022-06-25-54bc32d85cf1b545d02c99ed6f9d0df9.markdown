Termination is a fundamental liveness property for program verification. A loop bound is an upper bound of the number of loop iterations for a given program. The existence of a loop bound evidences the termination of the program. This paper employs a reinforced black-box learning approach for termination proving, consisting of a loop bound learner and a validation checker. We present efficient data-driven algorithms for inferring various kinds of loop bounds, including simple loop bounds
