Die-casting is a popular manufacturing process that produces precise metal parts with excellent dimensional accuracy and smooth cast surfaces. Recently die-casting process condition data can be acquired to be used as input for machine learning techniques for fault detection. The rapid development of complex and accurate machine learning algorithms, such as tree ensembles and deep learning, allows the accurate detection of faulty products. However, interpreting and explaining black-box …
