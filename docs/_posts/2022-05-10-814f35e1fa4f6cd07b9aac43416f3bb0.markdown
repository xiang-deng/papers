With exascale supercomputers on the horizon, data-driven in situ data reduction is a very important topic that potentially enables post hoc data visualization, reconstruction, and exploration with the goal of minimal information loss. Sophisticated sampling methods provide a fast approximation to the data that can be used as a preview to the simulation output without the need for full data reconstruction. More detailed analysis can then be performed by reconstructing the Cites: Visualization-aware sampling for very large databases
