In this paper, we present a novel approach to knowledge extraction and retrieval using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for material science. Our goal is to automatically mine structured knowledge from millions of research articles in the field of polycrystalline materials and make it easily accessible to the broader community. The proposed method leverages NLP techniques such as entity recognition and document classification to extract relevant information and build an  Cites: A Frustratingly Easy Approach for Entity and Relation Extraction
