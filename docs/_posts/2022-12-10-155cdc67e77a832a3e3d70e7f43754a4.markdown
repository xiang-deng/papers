Generative modeling of human motion has broad applications in computer animation, virtual reality, and robotics. Conventional approaches develop separate models for different motion synthesis tasks, and typically use a model of a small size to avoid overfitting the scarce data available in each setting. It remains an open question whether developing a single unified model is feasible, which may 1) benefit the acquirement of novel skills by combining skills learned from multiple tasks, and 2)  Cites: Diffusion-LM Improves Controllable Text Generation
