In this study, we analyze NLG automatic metrics based on whether human evaluation aspect is used as context or objective to compute the metrics:(i) Task-agnostic and (ii) Humanaligned. Task-agnostic metrics, such as Perplexity, BLEU, BERTScore, are cost-effective and highly adaptable to diverse NLG tasks, yet they have a weak correlation with human. Humanaligned metrics (CTC, CtrlEval, UniEval) improves correlation level by incorporating desirable human-like qualities as training objective  Cites: Understanding the extent to which content quality metrics measure
