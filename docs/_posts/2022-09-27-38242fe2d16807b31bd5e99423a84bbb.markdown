Data augmentation is a simple but effective way to improve the effectiveness and the robustness of pre-trained models. However, they are difficult to adapt to token-level tasks such as named entity recognition (NER) because of the different semantic granularity and more fine-grained labels. Inspired by some mixup augmentations in computer vision, we proposed three sentence-level data augmentations including CMix, CombiMix, TextMosaic, and adapted them to the NER task. Through empirical …
