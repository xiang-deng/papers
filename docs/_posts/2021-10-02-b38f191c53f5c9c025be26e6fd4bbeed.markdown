Meta-learning has gained wide popularity as a training framework that is more data- efficient than traditional machine learning methods. However, its generalization ability in complex task distributions, such as multimodal tasks, has not been thoroughly studied. Recently, some studies on multimodality-based meta-learning have emerged. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the multimodality- based meta-learning landscape in terms of the methodologies and applications.
