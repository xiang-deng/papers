Abstract Knowledge Graphs represent real-world facts and are used in several applications; however, they are often incomplete and have many missing facts. Link prediction is the task of completing these missing facts from existing ones. Embedding models based on Tensor Factorization attain state-of-the-art results in link prediction. Nevertheless, the embeddings they produce can not be easily interpreted. Inspired by previous work on word embeddings, we propose inducing …
