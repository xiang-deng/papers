We consider event extraction in a generative manner with template-based conditional generation. Although there is a rising trend of casting the task of event extraction as a sequence generation problem with prompts, these generation-based methods have several significant challenges, including using suboptimal prompts, static event type information, and the overwhelming number of irrelevant event types. In this paper, we propose a generative template-based method with dynamic prefixes  Cites: Factual Probing Is [MASK]: Learning vs. Learning to Recall
