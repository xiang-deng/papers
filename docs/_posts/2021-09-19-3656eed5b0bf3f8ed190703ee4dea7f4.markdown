The aspect-based sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE), as a complete sentiment analysis task, aims to recognize the aspect term, the opinion expression, and the sentiment polarity in a sentence. Current state-of-the-art ASTE models employ a joint extracting scheme for better task improvements. However, how to better solve the triplet overlap issues in the task, and effectively model the mutual interactions between the triplet structures remain challenging. In this work, we explore a neural Cites: A neural transition-based model for nested mention recognition
