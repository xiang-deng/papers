5G is the 5th generation cellular network protocol. It is the state-of-the-art global wireless standard that enables an advanced kind of network designed to connect virtually everyone and everything with increased speed and reduced latency. Therefore, its development, analysis, and security are critical. However, all approaches to the 5G protocol development and security analysis, eg, property extraction, protocol summarization, and semantic analysis of the protocol Cites: A supervised approach to extractive summarisation of scientific
