The ability to infer pre-and postconditions of an action is vital for comprehending complex instructions, and is essential for applications such as autonomous instruction-guided agents and assistive AI that supports humans to perform physical tasks. In this work, we propose a task dubbed action condition inference, and collecting a high-quality, human annotated dataset of preconditions and postconditions of actions in instructional manuals. We propose a weakly supervised … Cites: ‪ESTER: A Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset for Event …‬
