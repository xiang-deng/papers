Automatic open-domain dialogue generation is an important topic in natural language generation research. Due to the lack of good automatic evaluation methods, it is usually evaluated manually, which makes it difficult to compare different generation models. Automatic evaluation methods of natural language used in the past often required a reference corpus. However, for open-domain dialogue generation, the reference corpus will limit the possibilities of generation. In order to Cites: Well-read students learn better: The impact of student initialization
