Because humans instinctively trust and interact with explainable representations instead of latent features, intrinsically interpretable models (IIMs) aimed at representations with semantic meanings have been extensively studied. Previous IIMs relied heavily on data-driven deep neural networks, which resulted in a tremendous demand for data and complex mappings established between instances and their representations. In this study, inspired by how humans build semantic …
