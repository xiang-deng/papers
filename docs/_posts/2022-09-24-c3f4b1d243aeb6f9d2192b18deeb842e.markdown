The efficient detection of the flat jujube in a complex natural environment has great significance in intelligent agricultural operations. Aiming at the problems of the low detection efficiency of field flat jujubes and complex target detection algorithms that are difficult to deploy on low-cost equipment, an improved lightweight algorithm based on You Only Look Once (YOLOv5) is proposed. First, the method screens for the multiscale detection structure that is suitable for the flat jujube by adjusting the …
