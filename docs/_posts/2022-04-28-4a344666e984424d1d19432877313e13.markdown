Abstract Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been used to handle a wide range of computer vision problems, including image classification and object detection. Image classification refers to automatically classifying a huge number of images and various techniques have been developed for accomplishing this goal. The focus of this article is to enhance image classification accuracy implemented on CNN models by using the concept of transfer learning and progressive resizing with Cites: Shortformer: Better language modeling using shorter inputs
