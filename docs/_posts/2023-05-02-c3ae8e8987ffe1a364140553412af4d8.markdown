Explainable AI (XAI) aims to answer ethical and legal questions associated with the deployment of AI models. However, a considerable number of domain-specific reviews highlight the need of a mathematical foundation for the key notions in the field, considering that even the term explanation still lacks a precise definition. These reviews also advocate for a sound and unifying formalism for explainable AI, to avoid the emergence of ill-posed questions, and to help researchers navigate a Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
