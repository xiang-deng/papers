In this paper we describe how we estimated production activity in the manufacturing industry in Japan by analyzing the characteristics of fluctuations in the high-frequency electricity demand data published by major Japanese electric power companies, on the basis that the manufacturing industry consumes electricity when carrying out production activity. We constructed mathematical models to estimate production activity in each area of Japan on the basis of electricity data provided by Cites: Using social media to measure labor market flows
