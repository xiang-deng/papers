The extractive text summarization (ETS) method for finding the salient information from a text automatically uses the exact sentences from the source text. In this article, we answer the question of what quality of a summary we can achieve with ETS methods? To maximize the ROUGE-1 score, we used five approaches:(1) adapted reduced variable neighborhood search (RVNS),(2) Greedy algorithm,(3) VNS initialized by Greedy algorithm results,(4) genetic algorithm, and (5) genetic  Cites: Understanding the extent to which content quality metrics measure
