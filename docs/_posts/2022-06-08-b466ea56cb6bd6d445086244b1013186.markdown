Electronic design automation (EDA) technology has achieved remarkable progress over the past decades. However, modern chip design is not completely automatic yet in general and the gap is not easily surmountable. For example, the chip design flow is still largely restricted to individual point tools with limited interplay across tools and design steps. Tools applied at early steps cannot well judge if their solutions may eventually lead to satisfactory designs, inevitably leading to over-pessimistic design Cites: A graph placement methodology for fast chip design
