Media framing bias can lead to increased political polarization, and thus, the need for automatic mitigation methods is growing. We propose a new task, a neutral summary generation from multiple news headlines of the varying political spectrum, to facilitate balanced and unbiased news reading. In this paper, we first collect a new dataset, obtain some insights about framing bias through a case study, and propose a new effective metric and models for the task. Lastly, we conduct experimental analyses to Cites: Hierarchical transformers for multi-document summarization
