Inferencing unlabeled data from labeled data is an error-prone process. Conventional neural network training is highly sensitive to supervision errors. These two realities make semi-supervised learning (SSL) troublesome. Often, SSL approaches fail to outperform their fully supervised baseline. Proposed is a novel framework for deep SSL, specifically pseudo-labeling, called contrastive credibility propagation (CCP).
