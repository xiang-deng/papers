Extractive document summarization (EDS) is usually seen as a sequence labeling task, which extracts sentences from a document one by one to form a summary. However, extracting sentences separately ignores the relationship between the sentences and documents. One solution is to use sentence position information to enhance sentence representation, but this will cause the sentence-leading bias problem, especially in news datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel sentence Cites: Discourse-Aware Neural Extractive Text Summarization
