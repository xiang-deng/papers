Although technology valuation has benefited considerably from recent advances in machine learning technology, the results of prior studies in this field are of limited use in practice because they rely solely on black box models whose internal mechanisms are hidden. We develop an analytical framework for successful expertmachine collaborations for technology valuation using interpretable machine learning that makes a model s behaviors and predictions understandable to humans.
