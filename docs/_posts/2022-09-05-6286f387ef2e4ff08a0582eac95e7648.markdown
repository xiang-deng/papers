For Sentiment classification a suitable embedding to train a machine learning model is needed. A lot of research has been done on generating embeddings that are capable of storing the context of words, but they are inefficient for sentiment extraction as they cannot differentiate words used in the same situation but contrasting sentiment polarity. To address this issue, a lot of researchers have proposed different embedding models, but most of them are word embeddings  Cites: Sentiment embeddings with applications to sentiment analysis
