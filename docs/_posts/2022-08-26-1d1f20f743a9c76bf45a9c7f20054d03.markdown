Emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE) is a recently proposed task that aims to extract the potential clause pairs of emotions and its corresponding causes in a document. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for the ECPE task. We cast the task as a two-turn machine reading comprehension (MRC) task, ie, the extraction of emotions and causes is transformed to the task of identifying answer clauses from the input document specific to a query. This two-turn MRC formalization brings several key Cites: Neural Reading Comprehension and Beyond
