Learning with noisy labels is a vital topic for practical deep learning as models should be robust to noisy open-world datasets in the wild. The state-of-the-art noisy label learning approach JoCoR fails when faced with a large ratio of noisy labels. Moreover, selecting small-loss samples can also cause error accumulation as once the noisy samples are mistakenly selected as small-loss samples, they are more likely to be selected again. In this paper, we try to deal with error accumulation in …
