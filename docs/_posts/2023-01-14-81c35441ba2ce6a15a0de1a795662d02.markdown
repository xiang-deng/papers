Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with limited supervision has been a popular research topic as it can significantly alleviate the annotation burden. Self-training has been successfully applied in semi-supervised learning tasks, but one drawback of self-training is that it is vulnerable to the label noise from incorrect pseudo labels. Inspired by the fact that samples with similar labels tend to share similar representations, we develop a neighborhood-based sample selection approach to …
