Motivation Understanding the mechanisms underlying T cell receptor (TCR) binding is of fundamental importance to understanding adaptive immune responses. A better understanding of the biochemical rules governing TCR binding can be used, eg to guide the design of more powerful and safer T cell-based therapies. Advances in repertoire sequencing technologies have made available millions of TCR sequences. Data abundance has, in turn, fueled the development of many  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
