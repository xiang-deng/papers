Spelling correction is a particularly important problem in clinical natural language processing because of the abundant occurrence of misspellings in medical records. However, the scarcity of labeled datasets in a clinical context makes it hard to build a machine learning system for such clinical spelling correction. In this work, we present a probabilistic model of correcting misspellings based on a simple conditional independence assumption, which leads to a modular decomposition into a language Cites: BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
