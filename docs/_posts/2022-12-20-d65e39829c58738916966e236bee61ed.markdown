Counterfactual explanations (CEs) are a powerful means for understanding how decisions made by algorithms can be changed. Researchers have proposed a number of desiderata that CEs should meet to be practically useful, such as requiring minimal effort to enact, or complying with causal models. In this paper, we consider the interplay between the desiderata of robustness (ie, that enacting CEs remains feasible and cost-effective even if adverse events take place) and sparsity (ie, that Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
