As a result, they either suffer from conflicts among causal relations predicted separately or require a set of additional constraints to resolve such conflicts. We propose to study this task in a more realistic setting, where event-level causality identification can be made. The advantage is two folds: 1) with modeling different mentions of an event as a single …
