Understanding how, why and when energy consumption changes provides a tool for decision makers throughout the power networks. Thus, energy forecasting provides a great service. This research proposes a probabilistic approach to capture the five inherent dimensions of a forecast: three dimensions in space, time and probability. The forecasts are generated through different models based on artificial neural networks as a post-treatment of point forecasts based on shallow artificial neural …
