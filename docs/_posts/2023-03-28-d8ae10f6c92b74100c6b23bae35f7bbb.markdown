Label scarcity is a bottleneck for improving task performance in specialised domains. We propose a novel compositional transfer learning framework (DoT5-domain compositional zero-shot T5) for zero-shot domain transfer. Without access to in-domain labels, DoT5 jointly learns domain knowledge (from MLM of unlabelled in-domain free text) and task knowledge (from task training on more readily available general-domain data) in a multi-task manner. To improve the transferability of task …
