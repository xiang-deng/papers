Object detection is a fundamental computer vision task that simultaneously predicts the category and localization of the targets of interest. Recently one-stage (also termed dense) detectors have gained much attention over two-stage ones due to their simple pipeline and friendly application to end devices. Dense object detectors basically formulate object detection as dense classification and localization (ie, bounding box regression). The classification is usually optimized by Focal Loss and
