Quantum language models have attracted extensive attention in natural language processing tasks. Nevertheless, in this field measurement operators are mostly generated by randomly initialized parameter matrices, which cannot well explain the role of measurement operators in quantum theory. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Based Quantum-like Language Model (MBQLM). Specifically, each word is considered a fundamental event in quantum probability space, which is a …
