One of the most recent applications of machine learning is to translate sign language into natural language. Many studies have attempted to classify sign language based on whether it is gesture or facial expression. These efforts, however, ignore genuine sentences linguistic structure and context. The quality of traditional translation methods is poor, and their underlying models are not salable. They also take a long time to complete. The contribution of this paper is that it suggests utilizing a Cites: Data Augmentation for Sign Language Gloss Translation
