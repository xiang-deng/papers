The popularization of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and charging stations has been threatening the distribution network s reliability and efficiency. The prediction of EV charging demand can benefit the optimization of the operation of Energy-Transportation Nexus and improve social welfare towards a low carbon future. In this paper, a short-term probabilistic charging demand forecast model is proposed to estimate the quantiles of future charging demand of a charging station 15 minutes Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
