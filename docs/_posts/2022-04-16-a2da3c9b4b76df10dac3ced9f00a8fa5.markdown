The microservices architecture enables independent development and maintenance of application components through its fine-grained and modular design. This has enabled rapid adoption of microservices architecture to build latency-sensitive online applications. In such online applications, it is critical to detect and mitigate sources of performance degradation (bottlenecks). However, the modular design of microservices architecture leads to a large graph of interacting microservices whose Cites: Strategies for pre-training graph neural networks
