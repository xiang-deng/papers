Title: Structure-based Models for Neural Information Extraction Information Extraction (IE) is one of the important fields in Natural Language Processing. IE models can be exploited to obtain meaningful information from raw text and provide them in a structured format which can be used for downstream applications such as question answering. An IE system consists of several tasks including entity recognition, relation extraction, and event detection, to name a few. Among all recent advanced …
