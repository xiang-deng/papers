Contextual path retrieval (CPR) refers to the task of finding contextual path (s) between a pair of entities in a knowledge graph which explains the connection between them in a given context. For this novel retrieval task, we propose the Embedding-based Contextual Path Retrieval (ECPR) framework. ECPR is based on a three-component structure which includes a context encoder and path encoder that encode query context and path respectively, and a path ranker that assigns a ranking Cites: Multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning with reward shaping
