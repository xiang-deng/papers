While deep learning has outperformed other methods for various tasks, theoretical frameworks that explain its reason have not been fully established. To address this issue, we investigate the excess risk of two-layer ReLU neural networks in a teacher-student regression model, in which a student network learns an unknown teacher network through its outputs. Especially, we consider the student network that has the same width as the teacher network and is trained in two phases: first by noisy … Cites: ‪Towards understanding hierarchical learning: Benefits of neural …‬
