Training deep learning models in the cloud or on dedicated hardware is expensive. A more cost-efficient option are hyperscale clouds offering spot instances, a cheap but ephemeral alternative to on-demand resources. As spot instance availability can change depending on the time of day, continent, and cloud provider, it could be more cost-efficient to distribute resources over the world. Still, it has not been investigated whether geo-distributed, data-parallel spot deep learning training could be a more …
