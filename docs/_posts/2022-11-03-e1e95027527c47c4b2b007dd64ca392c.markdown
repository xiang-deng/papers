Coupled aspect-opinion extraction aims to identify aspect-opinion pairs in the form of (aspect term, opinion term) or triplets in the form of (aspect term, opinion term, sentiment polarity) from user-generated texts. Compared to the traditional aspect-based sentiment prediction or extraction tasks, coupled aspect-opinion extraction needs to associate aspects with their corresponding opinions and organize opinion-related information into structured outputs.
