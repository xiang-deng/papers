Maximal clique enumeration on uncertain graphs is a fundamental problem in uncertain graph analysis. In this paper, we study a problem of enumerating all maximal (k, n)-cliques on an uncertain graph G, where a vertex set H of G is a maximal (k, n)-clique if (1) H (| H| k) is a clique with probability no less than n, and (2) H is a maximal vertex set satisfying (1). The state-of-the-art algorithms for enumerating all maximal (k, n)-cliques are based on a set enumeration technique Cites: Never-ending learning
