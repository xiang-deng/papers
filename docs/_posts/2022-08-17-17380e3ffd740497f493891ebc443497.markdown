Feature selection plays an impactful role in deep recommender systems, which selects a subset of the most predictive features, so as to boost the recommendation performance and accelerate model optimization. The majority of existing feature selection methods, however, aim to select only a fixed subset of features. This setting cannot fit the dynamic and complex environments of practical recommender systems, where the contribution of a specific feature varies significantly across user-item Cites: Neural input search for large scale recommendation models
