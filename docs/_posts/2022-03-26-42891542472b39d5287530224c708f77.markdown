Mining aligned natural language (NL) and programming language (PL) pairs is a critical task to NL-PL understanding. Existing methods applied specialized hand- crafted features or separately-trained models for each PL. However, they usually suffered from low transferability across multiple PLs, especially for niche PLs with less annotated data. Fortunately, a Stack Overflow answer post is essentially a sequence of text and code blocks and its global textual context can provide PL Cites: Reranking for neural semantic parsing
