Deep learning techniques and algorithms are emerging as a disruptive technology with the potential to transform global economies, environments and societies. They have been applied to planning and management problems of urban water systems in general, however, there is lack of a systematic review of the current state of deep learning applications and an examination of potential directions where deep learning can contribute to solving urban water challenges. Here we provide such a review Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
