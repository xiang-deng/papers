We describe a method for merging multiple spreadsheets into one sheet, and/or exchanging data among the sheets, by expressing each sheet s formulae as an algebraic (equational) theory and each sheet s values as a model of its theory, expressing the overlap between the sheets as theory and model morphisms, and then performing colimit, lifting, and Kan-extension constructions from category theory to compute a canonically universal integrated theory and model, which can then be Cites: Principles of data integration
