Entity Alignment (EA) is a crucial task in knowledge fusion, which aims to link entities with the same real-world identity from different Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Existing methods have achieved satisfactory performance, however, they mainly focus on single modal KG, which is difficult to be effectively applied to multi-modal scenes. In this paper, we propose a Multi-modal Joint entity Alignment Framework (MultiJAF), which can effectively utilize the knowledge of various modalities. Concretely, we first Cites: Exploring and Evaluating Attributes, Values, and Structures for
