Today s state of the art visual navigation agents typically consist of large deep learning architectures trained end to end. Such models offer little to no interpretability about the skills learned by the agent or the actions taken by it in response to its environment. While past works have explored interpreting deep learning models, little attention has been devoted to interpreting embodied AI systems, which often involve reasoning about the structure of the environment, target characteristics and …
