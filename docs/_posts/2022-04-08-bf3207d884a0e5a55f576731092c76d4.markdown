Identifying biosynthetic gene clusters from genomic data is challenging, with many in- silico tools suffering from a high rediscovery rate due to their dependence on rule- based algorithms. Next generation sequencing has provided an abundance of genomic information, and it has been hypothesized that there are many undiscovered biosynthetic gene clusters within this dataset. Here, we aim to develop a machine learning tool, ML-Miner, that infers patterns that describe a biosynthetic Cites: Structure-based protein function prediction using graph
