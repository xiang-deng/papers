Cross-domain text sentiment analysis is a text sentiment classification task that uses the existing source domain annotation data to assist the target domain, which can not only reduce the workload of new domain data annotation, but also significantly improve the utilization of source domain annotation resources. In order to effectively achieve the performance of cross-domain text sentiment classification, this paper proposes a BERT-based aspect-level sentiment analysis algorithm for cross-domain  Cites: Aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network
