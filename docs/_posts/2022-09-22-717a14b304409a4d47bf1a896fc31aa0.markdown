The outbreak of COVID-19 brings almost the biggest explosions of scientific literature ever. Facing such volume literature, it is hard for researches to find desired citation when carrying out COVID-19 related research, especially for junior researchers. This paper presents a novel neural network based method, called citation relational BERT with heterogeneous deep graph convolutional network (CRB-HDGCN), for COVID-19 inline citation recommendation task. The CRB-HDGCN contains two main stages …
