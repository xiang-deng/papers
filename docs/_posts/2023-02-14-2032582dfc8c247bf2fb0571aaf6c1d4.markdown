Traditional methods to recognize named entities are conducted as sequence labelling or span classification. They are usually implemented on a raw input without any cue about possible named entities. This method cannot be aware of entity boundaries and learn semantic dependencies between them. Cognitive neuroscience has revealed that foveating stimuli improves the efficiency of processing in terms of acuity. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a controlled Cites: A neural transition-based model for nested mention recognition
