In the past years, machine learning (ML) has become a popular approach to support self-adaptation. While ML techniques enable dealing with several problems in self- adaptation, such as scalable decision-making, they are also subject to inherent challenges. In this paper, we focus on one such challenge that is particularly important for self-adaptation: ML techniques are designed to deal with a set of predefined tasks associated with an operational domain; they have problems to deal Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
