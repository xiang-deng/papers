Supervised machine learning utilizes large datasets, often with ground truth labels annotated by humans. While some data points are easy to classify, others are hard to classify, which reduces the inter-annotator agreement. This causes noise for the classifier and might affect the user s perception of the classifier s performance. In our research, we investigated whether the classification difficulty of a data point influences how strongly a prediction mistake reduces the perceived accuracy.
