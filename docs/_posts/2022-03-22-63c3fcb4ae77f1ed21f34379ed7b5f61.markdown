Abstract Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) neural network models are able to generate natural sounding conversational responses for open domain dialogue systems. However, these models tend to produce safe, universal responses (eg, I don t know) regardless of the input, which carry little information and can easily lead to the end of a conversation. In this paper, we propose a new Topic-driven Response Generation Model (TRGM). The proposed model leverages topic information to Cites: A knowledge-grounded neural conversation model
