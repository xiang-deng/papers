Abstract Knowledge reasoning helps overcome the incompleteness of knowledge graphs (KGs) and has significantly contributed to the development of large KGs. Rule mining, one of the key tasks of knowledge reasoning, studies the problem of learning interpretable inference patterns over KGs. Existing rule mining methods mainly focus on learning rules that consist of different relations and variables, restricting the form of rules to be closed path. While rules could be diverse and in order to enrich the Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
