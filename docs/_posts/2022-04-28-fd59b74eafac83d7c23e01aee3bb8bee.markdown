We consider neural sign language translation: machine translation from signed to written languages using encoderdecoder neural networks. Translating sign language videos to written language text is especially complex because of the difference in modality between source and target language and, consequently, the required video processing. At the same time, sign languages are low-resource languages, their datasets dwarfed by those available for written languages. Recent Cites: Data Augmentation for Sign Language Gloss Translation
