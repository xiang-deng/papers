With convolution operations, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are good at extracting local features but experience difficulty to capture global representations. With cascaded self-attention modules, vision transformers can capture long-distance feature dependencies but unfortunately deteriorate local feature details. In this paper, we propose a hybrid network structure, termed Conformer, to take both advantages of convolution operations and self-attention mechanisms for enhanced Cites: Coatnet: Marrying convolution and attention for all data sizes
