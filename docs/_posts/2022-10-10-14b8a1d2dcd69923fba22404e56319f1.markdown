Few-shot classification aims to enable the network to acquire the ability of feature extraction and label prediction for the target categories given a few numbers of labeled samples. Current few-shot classification methods focus on the pretraining stage while fine-tuning by experience or not at all. No fine-tuning or insufficient fine-tuning may get low accuracy for the given tasks, while excessive fine-tuning will lead to poor generalization for unseen samples. To solve the above problems, this study Cites: Accuracy on the line: on the strong correlation between out-of
