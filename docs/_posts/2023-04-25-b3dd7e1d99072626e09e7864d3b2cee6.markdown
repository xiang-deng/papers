Labeling short, unstructured texts is generally performed by sequentially identifying codes and assigning them to segments of text based on viewing a small sample of data. In this greedy approach, coders risk overlooking important code ideas and must perform the tedious task of iteratively revising the initial code set, and sometimes response code assignments, as new themes emerge. To address this, we propose CodeML, a machine learning-assisted (ML) coding interface that identifies multiple …
