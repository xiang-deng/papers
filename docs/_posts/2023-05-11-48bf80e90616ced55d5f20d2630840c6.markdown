Event Extraction (EE), aiming to identify and classify event triggers and arguments from event mentions, has benefited from pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, existing PLM-based methods ignore the information of trigger/argument fields, which is crucial for understanding event schemas. To this end, we propose a Probabilistic reCoupling model enhanced Event extraction framework (ProCE). Specifically, we first model the syntactic-related event fields as probabilistic biases, to …
