Machine unlearning aims to erase the impact of specific training samples upon deleted requests from a trained model. Re-training the model on the retained data after deletion is an effective but not efficient way due to the huge number of model parameters and re-training samples. To speed up, a natural way is to reduce such parameters and samples. However, such a strategy typically leads to a loss in model performance, which poses the challenge that increasing the unlearning efficiency  Cites: K-adapter: Infusing knowledge into pre-trained models with adapters
