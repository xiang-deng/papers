Positional reasoning is the process of ordering unsorted parts contained in a set into a consistent structure. We present Positional Diffusion, a plug-and-play graph formulation with Diffusion Probabilistic Models to address positional reasoning. We use the forward process to map elements positions in a set to random positions in a continuous space. Positional Diffusion learns to reverse the noising process and recover the original positions through an Attention-based Graph Neural Network.
