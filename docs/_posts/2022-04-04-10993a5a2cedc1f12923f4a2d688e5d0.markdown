Networks can be used to model complex real-world systems from many domains, including computational biology. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network (PPIN), in which nodes are proteins and edges are PPIs, is a popular type of biological network. While PPIN data are becoming widely available thanks to biotechnological advancements, functions of many proteins remain unknown. As such, many computational techniques have been developed to analyze PPINs in order to gain Cites: Structure-based protein function prediction using graph
