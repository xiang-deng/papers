Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and mapping & scheduling optimization methods are being used to find efficient implementations of computationally-intense language models such as BERT. This requires measuring real hardware inference latency: good design decisions simply cannot be made with proxy metrics such as FLOPs or the number of parameters. However, the time required to perform on-device latency measurements is prohibitive (eg, a few days to …
