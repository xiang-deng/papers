Unsupervised Relation Extraction (RE) aims to identify relations between entities in text, without having access to labeled data during training. This setting is particularly relevant for domain specific RE where no annotated dataset is available and for open-domain RE where the types of relations are a priori unknown. Although recent approaches achieve promising results, they heavily depend on hyperparameters whose tuning would most often require labeled data.
