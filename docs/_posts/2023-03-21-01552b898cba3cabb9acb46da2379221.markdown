In large-scale complex knowledge graphs (KGs) for knowledge reasoning, most existing methods ignore the hierarchical features of KGs, limiting their efficiency in recommender systems, information retrieval, and intelligent Q&A systems by their discrete nature. Based on the translationbased knowledge graph embedding method, this paper proposes a hierarchical embedding method for large-scale complex KGs, which encodes the semantics of entity representations through …
