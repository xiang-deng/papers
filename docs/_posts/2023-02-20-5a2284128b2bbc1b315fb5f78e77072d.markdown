Although eager-mode frameworks are more convenient, they are less efficient today as operations are dispatched to the hardware one at a time. This execution model precludes, for example, operation fusion, which is essential for executing ML workloads efficiently. In this paper we present Torchy, a tracing JIT compiler for PyTorch, one of the mainstream eager-mode frameworks. Torchy achieves similar performance as data-flow frameworks, while providing the same semantics of straight …
