Social networks are an essential component of the Internet of People (IoP) and play an important role in stimulating interactive communication among people. Graph convolutional networks provide methods for social network analysis with its impressive performance in semi-supervised node classification. However, the existing methods are based on the assumption of balanced data distribution and ignore the imbalanced problem of social networks.
