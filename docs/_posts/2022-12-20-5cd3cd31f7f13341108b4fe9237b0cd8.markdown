A methodology is proposed, which addresses the caveat that line-of-sight emission spectroscopy presents in that it cannot provide spatially resolved temperature measurements in nonhomogeneous temperature fields. The aim of this research is to explore the use of data-driven models in measuring temperature distributions in a spatially resolved manner using emission spectroscopy data. Two categories of data-driven methods are analyzed:(i) Feature engineering and classical machine learning Cites: A closer look at deep learning heuristics: Learning rate restarts
