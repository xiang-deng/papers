Event Detection (ED) aims to recognize instances of specified types of event triggers in text. Existing graph neural network-based models have achieved promising progress to alleviate this problem by capturing different orders of syntactic information, but they are limited by two issues. First, the long-range syntactic information between words is not fully exploited. Second, they ignore the semantic information provided by dependency labels which provide linguistic knowledge that  Cites: Is killed more significant than fled? a contextual model for salient
