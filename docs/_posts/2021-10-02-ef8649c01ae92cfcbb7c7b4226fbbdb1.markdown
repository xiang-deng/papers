Auditing trained deep learning (DL) models prior to deployment is vital in preventing unintended consequences. One of the biggest challenges in auditing is in understanding how we can obtain human-interpretable specifications that are directly useful to the end-user. We address this challenge through a sequence of semantically-aligned unit tests, where each unit test verifies whether a predefined specification (eg, accuracy over 95%) is satisfied with respect to controlled and Cites: Certified robustness to adversarial word substitutions
