Uncertainty is a natural character of knowledge, while it is still tough to be encoded into the knowledge graph embedding space that can be employed for machine learning tasks. However, the approximate inference could be performed in the embedding space, if confidence, real-value representation of the uncertainty of knowledge facts, can be learned by neural networks. To tackle this, a simple yet effective confidence predicting method is proposed, and several approximate Cites: Never-ending learning
