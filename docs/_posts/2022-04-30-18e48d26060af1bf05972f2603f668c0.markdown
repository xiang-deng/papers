Knowledge-aware methods have boosted a range of Natural Language Processing applications over the last decades. With the gathered momentum, knowledge recently has been pumped into enormous attention in document summarization research. Previous works proved that knowledge-embedded document summarizers excel at generating superior digests, especially in terms of informativeness, coherence, and fact consistency. This paper pursues to present the first systematic Cites: SciREX: A challenge dataset for document-level information
