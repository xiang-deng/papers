As high-performance computing systems continue to advance, the gap between computing performance and I/O capabilities is widen-ing. This bottleneck limits the storage capabilities of increasingly large-scale simulations, which generate data at never-before-seen granularities while only being able to store a small subset of the raw data. Recently, strategies for data-driven sampling have been pro-posed to intelligently sample the data in a way that achieves high data reduction rates while  Cites: Visualization-aware sampling for very large databases
