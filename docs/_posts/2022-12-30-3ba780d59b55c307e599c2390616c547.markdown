Abstract The problem of Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is a significant issue in Natural Language Processing (NLP). STS recognizes and measures semantic relations between two texts. Since the ability to determine the degree of the semantic relationship between sentence pairs is an integral part of machines that understand and infer natural language, we intend to improve the performance of the neural network systems computing the degree of the semantic relation. We propose a graph  Cites: Deep Unordered Composition Rivals Syntactic Methods for Text
