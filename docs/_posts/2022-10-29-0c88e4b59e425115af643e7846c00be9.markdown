In this paper, we propose a framework called Gating-controlled Forgetting and Learning mechanisms for Deep Knowledge Tracing (GFLDKT for short). In GFLDKT, two gating-controlled mechanisms are designed to model explicitly forgetting and learning behaviors in students learning process. With the designed gating-controlled mechanisms, both the interaction records and students different backgrounds are combined effectively for tracing the dynamic changes of students mastery of Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
