Zero-shot transfer learning for Dialogue State Tracking (DST) helps to handle a variety of task-oriented dialogue domains without the cost of collecting in-domain data. Existing works mainly study common data-or model-level augmentation methods to enhance the generalization but fail to effectively decouple the semantics of samples, limiting the zero-shot performance of DST. In this paper, we present a simple and effective  divide, conquer and combine  solution, which explicitly …
