In recent years, neural networks have achieved impressive performance on dialogue response generation. However, most of these models still suffer from some shortcomings, such as yielding uninformative responses and lacking explainable ability. The paper proposes a Two-Stage Dialogue Response Generation model (TSRG), which specifies a method to generate diverse and informative responses based on an interpretable procedure between stages.
