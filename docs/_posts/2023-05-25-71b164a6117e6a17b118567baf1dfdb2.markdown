Recent progress in large language models has enabled the deployment of many generative NLP applications. At the same time, it has also led to a misleading public discourse that``it s all been solved. Not surprisingly, this has in turn made many NLP researchers--especially those at the beginning of their career--wonder about what NLP research area they should focus on. This document is a compilation of NLP research directions that are rich for exploration, reflecting the views of a diverse  Cites: Quantifying adaptability in pre-trained language models with 500
