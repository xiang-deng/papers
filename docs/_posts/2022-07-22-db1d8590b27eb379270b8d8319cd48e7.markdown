Abstract In the United States, the probability of work zone crashes has increased due to an increase in renovation works by transportation infrastructures. The severity of work zone crashes is associated with multiple contributing factors such as the roadway s geometric design features, temporal variables, environmental conditions, types of vehicles, and driver behaviors.
