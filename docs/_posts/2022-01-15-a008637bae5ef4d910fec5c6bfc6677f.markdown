Self-admitted technical debt (SATD) refers to a specific type of technical debt that is introduced intentionally in the software development and maintenance processes. SATD enables practitioners to take some temporary solutions instead of making comprehensive decisions, which will lead to the high complexity of the software. However, most existing studies relied on manual methods for detecting SATDs. A recent study proposed a method HATD that used a hybrid attention-based method to Cites: Text generation from knowledge graphs with graph transformers
