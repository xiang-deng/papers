We present a framework for ranking images within their class based on the strength of spurious cues present. By measuring the gap in accuracy on the highest and lowest ranked images (we call this spurious gap), we assess spurious feature reliance for $89 $ diverse ImageNet models, finding that even the best models underperform in images with weak spurious presence. However, the effect of spurious cues varies far more dramatically across classes, emphasizing the crucial Cites: Accuracy on the line: on the strong correlation between out-of
