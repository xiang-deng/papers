The purpose of crossdomain opinion classification is to leverage useful information acquired from the source domain to train a classifier for opinion classification in the target domain, which has a huge amount of unlabeled data. An opinion classifier trained on a specific domain usually acts poorly, when directly employed to another domain. Annotating the data for all the domains is a laborious and costly process. The majority of available approaches are centered on identifying invariant features Cites: Document modeling with gated recurrent neural network for
