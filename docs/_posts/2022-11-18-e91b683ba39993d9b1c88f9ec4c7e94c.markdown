Language models (LMs) are becoming the foundation for almost all major language technologies, but their capabilities, limitations, and risks are not well understood. We present Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) to improve the transparency of language models. First, we taxonomize the vast space of potential scenarios (ie use cases) and metrics (ie desiderata) that are of interest for LMs. Then we select a broad subset based on coverage and feasibility, noting what s missing or  Cites: Transcending scaling laws with 0.1% extra compute
