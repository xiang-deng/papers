Water pollution is a global problem. In developing countries like India, water pollution is growing exponentially due to faster unsustainable industrial developments and poor waste-water management. Hence, it is essential to predict the future levels of pollutants from the historical water quality data of the reservoir with the help of appropriate water quality modeling and forecasting. Subsequently, these forecasting results can be utilized to plan and execute the water quality management steps in …
