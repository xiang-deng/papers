Source code representation learning is the basis of applying artificial intelligence to many software engineering tasks such as code clone detection, algorithm classification, and code summarization. Recently, many works have tried to improve the performance of source code representation from various perspectives, eg, introducing the structural information of programs into latent representation. However, when dealing with rapidly expanded unlabeled cross-language source Cites: StructVAE: Tree-structured Latent Variable Models for Semi
