Conversational search has seen increased recent attention in both the IR and NLP communities. It seeks to clarify and solve a user s search need through multi-turn natural language interactions. However, most existing systems are trained and demonstrated with recorded or artificial conversation logs. Eventually, conversational search systems should be trained, evaluated, and deployed in an open-ended setting with unseen conversation trajectories. A key challenge is that training and  Cites: BoolQ: Exploring the Surprising Difficulty of Natural Yes/No
