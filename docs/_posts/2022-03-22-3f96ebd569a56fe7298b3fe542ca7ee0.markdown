Large-scale pre-training has shown remarkable performance in building open- domain dialogue systems. However, previous works mainly focus on showing and evaluating the conversational performance of the released dialogue model, ignoring the discussion of some key factors towards a powerful human-like chatbot, especially in Chinese scenarios. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate these under-explored factors, including data quality control, model architecture Cites: Retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive nlp tasks
