As an ownership verification technique for deep neural networks, the white-box neural network watermark is being challenged by the functionality equivalence attack. By leveraging the structural symmetry within a deep neural network and manipulating the parameters accordingly, an adversary can invalidate almost all white-box watermarks without affecting the network s performance. This paper introduces the linear functionality equivalence attack, which can adapt to different …
