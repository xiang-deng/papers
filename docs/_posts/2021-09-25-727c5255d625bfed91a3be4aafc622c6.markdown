Streaming recognition of multi-talker conversations has so far been evaluated only for 2-speaker single-turn sessions. In this paper, we investigate it for multi-turn meetings containing multiple speakers using the Streaming Unmixing and Recognition Transducer (SURT) model, and show that naively extending the single- turn model to this harder setting incurs a performance penalty. As a solution, we propose the dual-path (DP) modeling strategy first used for time-domain speech Cites: Blockwise Self-Attention for Long Document Understanding
