Transformer-based models for question answering (QA) over tables and texts confront a long hybrid sequence over tabular and textual elements, causing long-range reasoning problems. To handle long-range reasoning, we extensively employ a fusion-in-decoder (FiD) and exponential moving average (EMA), proposing a {underline {M} oving {underline {A} verage Equipped {underline {F} usion-{underline {i} n-{underline {D} ecoder ({textbf {MAFiD}). With FiD as the backbone architecture Cites: TABBIE: Pretrained Representations of Tabular Data
