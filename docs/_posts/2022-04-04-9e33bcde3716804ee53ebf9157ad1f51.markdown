In computer vision, it has achieved great success in adapting large-scale pretrained vision models (eg, Vision Transformer) to downstream tasks via fine-tuning. Common approaches for fine-tuning either update all model parameters or leverage linear probes. In this paper, we aim to study parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for Vision Transformers on vision tasks. We formulate efficient fine-tuning as a subspace training problem and perform a comprehensive benchmarking over different efficient Cites: Knowledge guided text retrieval and reading for open domain
