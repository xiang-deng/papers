In this paper, we study a large-scale multi-agent minimax optimization problem, which models many interesting applications in statistical learning and game theory, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The overall objective is a sum of agents  private local objective functions. We first analyze an important special case, empirical minimax problem, where the overall objective approximates a true population minimax risk by statistical samples. We provide generalization bounds for
