A method for constructing and training a Decentralized Migration Diagram Neutral Network (DMDNN) model for a production process, including: determining a production task input management node, distributed management nodes and a granularity of each of the distributed management nodes, and constructing a production system network; constructing network calculation nodes on each of the distributed management nodes; constructing and training a DMDNN model; and Cites: Hierarchical device placement with reinforcement learning
