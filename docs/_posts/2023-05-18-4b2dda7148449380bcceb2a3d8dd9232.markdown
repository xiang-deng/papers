Identifying which vulnerabilities need to be prioritized is a long-term challenge in IT security, especially as the number of vulnerabilities grows. Faced with a large number of vulnerability reports, there is an urgent need for automated tools or models to assess the potential severity and exploitability of vulnerabilities. This will help security experts screen vulnerabilities that should be focused on. In this study, we aim to predict vulnerability severity and exploitability characteristics using only  Cites: True few-shot learning with language models
