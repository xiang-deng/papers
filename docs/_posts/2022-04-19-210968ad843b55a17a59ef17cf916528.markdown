Graph neural network (GNN)-based deep learning (DL) models have been widely implemented to predict the experimental aqueous solvation free energy, while its prediction accuracy has reached a plateau partly due to the scarcity of available experimental data. In order to tackle this challenge, we first build a large and diverse calculated data set Frag20-Aqsol-100K of aqueous solvation free energy with reasonable computational cost and accuracy via electronic structure calculations Cites: Strategies for pre-training graph neural networks
