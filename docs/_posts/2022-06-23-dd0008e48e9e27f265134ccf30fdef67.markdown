The goal of this dissertation is to develop models, algorithms, and interaction protocols to improve the efficacy and quality of Human-Autonomy Interaction (HAI) in the domain of assistive robotics. In this domain, the most common control paradigm is that of manual teleoperation using control interfaces such as joysticks, switch-based head arrays, and sip-and-puff. However, manual teleoperation can become physically and cognitively burdensome to the human due to the limitations of the
