Unsupervised graph representation learning methods based on contrastive learning have drawn increasing attention and achieved promising performance. Most of these methods only model instance-level feature similarity while ignoring the underlying semantic structure of the whole data. In this paper, we propose a Graph Prototypical Contrastive Learning (GPCL) framework for unsupervised graph representation learning. Besides modeling instance-level feature similarity, GPCL explores the Cites: Strategies for pre-training graph neural networks
