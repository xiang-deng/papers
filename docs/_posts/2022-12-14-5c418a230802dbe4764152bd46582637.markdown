Instead of mining coherent topics from a given text corpus in a completely unsupervised manner, seed-guided topic discovery methods leverage user-provided seed words to extract distinctive and coherent topics so that the mined topics can better cater to the user s interest. To model the semantic correlation between words and seeds for discovering topic-indicative terms, existing seed-guided approaches utilize different types of context signals, such as document-level word co …
