We present SegNeXt, a simple convolutional network architecture for semantic segmentation. Recent transformer-based models have dominated the field of semantic segmentation due to the efficiency of self-attention in encoding spatial information. In this paper, we show that convolutional attention is a more efficient and effective way to encode contextual information than the self-attention mechanism in transformers. By re-examining the characteristics owned by successful segmentation  Cites: Rethinking pre-training and self-training
