From the latter half of the last decade, there has been a growing interest in developing algorithms for automatically solving mathematical word problems (MWP). It is a challenging and unique task that demands blending surface level text pattern recognition with mathematical reasoning. In spite of extensive research, we are still miles away from building robust representations of elementary math word problems and effective solutions for the general task. In this paper, we critically examine the Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
