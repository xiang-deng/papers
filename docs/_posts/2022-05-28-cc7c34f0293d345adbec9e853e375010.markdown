Semantic role labeling (SRL) focuses on recognizing the predicate-argument structure of a sentence and plays a critical role in many natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and question answering. Practically all available methods do not perform full SRL, since they rely on pre-identified predicates, and most of them follow a pipeline strategy, using specific models for undertaking one or several SRL subtasks. In addition, previous approaches have a strong dependence … Cites: ‪A structural probe for finding syntax in word representations‬
