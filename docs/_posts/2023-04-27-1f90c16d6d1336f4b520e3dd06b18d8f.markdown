Uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) are used to characterize the inherent uncertainty of knowledge and have a richer semantic structure than deterministic knowledge graphs. The research on the embedding of UKG has only recently begun, Uncertain Knowledge Graph Embedding (UKGE) model has a certain effect on solving this problem. However, there are still unresolved issues. On the one hand, when reasoning the confidence of unseen relation facts, the introduced probabilistic Cites: Never-ending learning
