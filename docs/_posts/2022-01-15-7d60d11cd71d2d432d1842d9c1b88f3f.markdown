Clinically, Taylor spatial frame (TSF) is usually used to correct femoral deformity. The first step in correction is to analyze skeletal deformities and measure the center of rotation of angulation (CORA). Since the above work needs to be done manually, the doctor s workload is heavy. Therefore, an automatic femoral deformity analysis system was proposed. Firstly, the Hough forest and constrained local models were trained on the femur image set. Then, the position and size of the femur in the X-ray Cites: Segmentation of the proximal femur from MR images using deep
