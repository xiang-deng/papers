The rapid development of data and artificial intelligence technology has introduced new opportunities and challenges to aeronautical information intelligence. However, there are many obstacles in the sharing, reasoning and reusing aeronautical data due to the disunity of norms, the opacity of sharing and semantic ambiguity. To a large extent, as a basic method for processing, storing and deducing aeronautical data in the future, NER provides a new idea for the natural language processing of  Cites: Generalized Data Augmentation for Low-Resource Translation
