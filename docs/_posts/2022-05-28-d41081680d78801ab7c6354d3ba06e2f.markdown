Text-to-SQL, the task of translating the natural language utterance into SQL, has attracted much attention recently. Under the cross-domain setting, the traditional semantic parse model is difficult to adapt to the invisible database schema. The key to being able to better handle cross-domain issues lies in the encoding method for modeling the natural language utterance and the database schema and establishing alignment between them. We propose a Graph Alignment for cross-domain Text-to  Cites: Spider: A Large-Scale Human-Labeled Dataset for Complex and
