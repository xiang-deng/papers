The lack of insight into deep learning systems hinders their systematic design. In science and engineering, modeling is a methodology used to understand complex systems whose internal processes are opaque. Modeling replaces a complex system with a simpler surrogate that is more amenable to interpretation. Drawing inspiration from this, we construct a class of surrogate models for neural networks using Gaussian processes.
