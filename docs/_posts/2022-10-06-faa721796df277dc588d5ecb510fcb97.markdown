Disk storage continues to be an important medium for data recording in software engineering, and recovering data from a failed storage disk can be expensive and time-consuming. Unfortunately, while physical damage instances are well documented, existing studies of data loss are limited, often only predicting times between failures. We present an empirical measurement of patterns of heat damage on indicative, low-cost commodity hard drives. Because damaged hard drives …
