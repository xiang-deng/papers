[Context and motivation] Incompleteness in natural-language requirements is a challenging problem.[Question/problem] A common technique for detecting incompleteness in requirements is checking the requirements against external sources. With the emergence of language models such as BERT, an interesting question is whether language models are useful external sources for finding potential incompleteness in requirements.[Principal ideas/results] We mask words in …
