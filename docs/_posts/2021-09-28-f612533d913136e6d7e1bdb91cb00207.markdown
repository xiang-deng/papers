Recently, knowledge graph embedding approaches which aim to learn latent semantic representations for entities and relations in the knowledge graph, have become an active research topic. In this paper, we focus on hyperbolic knowledge graph embedding with logical pattern learning, based on the following observations:(i) the hyperbolic embedding methods have shown promising performance for knowledge graphs, which always exhibit hierarchical patterns;(ii) the Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
