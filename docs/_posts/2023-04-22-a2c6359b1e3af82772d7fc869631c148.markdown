Unexpected failures in the electrical power transmission line can occur for several different, unpredictable reasons. Power failures on transmission lines can destroy the present power grid if faults aren t quickly detected and corrected. For consistent performance, it is essential to have a system in place for identifying and categorizing power system faults. Several academics have developed automated approaches for fault identification and classification; however, typical fault detection techniques …
