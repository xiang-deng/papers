Deep neural networks (DNNs) are currently being deployed as machine learning technology in a wide range of important real-world applications. DNNs consist of a huge number of parameters that require millions of floating-point operations (FLOPs) to be executed both in learning and prediction modes. A more effective method is to implement DNNs in a cloud computing system equipped with centralized servers and data storage sub-systems with high-speed and high-performance computing …
