We propose a method for formulating CCG as a recursive composition in a continuous vector space. Recent CCG supertagging and parsing models generally demonstrate high performance, yet rely on black-box neural architectures to implicitly model phrase structure dependencies. Instead, we leverage the method of holographic embeddings (Nickel et al., 2016) as a compositional operator to explicitly model the dependencies between words and phrase structures in the  Cites: Top-down tree long short-term memory networks
