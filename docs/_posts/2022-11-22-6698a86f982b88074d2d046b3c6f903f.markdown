Attention-based models have been widely used in aspect-level sentiment analysis owing to their contextual semantic-alignment capabilities. However, these models lack a mechanism that can incorporate syntactic tendencies. Thus, attention-based neural networks are less accurate when dealing with complex syntactic relationships and long-span syntactically dependent utterances. To solve this problem, a neural network model combining a conditional random field and a graph convolutional Cites: Aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network
