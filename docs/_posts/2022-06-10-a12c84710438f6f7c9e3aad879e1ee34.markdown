Target-specific sentiment analysis is an emerging topic in the field of text mining but current approaches to deriving the polarity of a sentence suffer from two main drawbacks: on one hand, we lack of a large and well-curated corpus, and on the other hand, current solutions based on deep learning are particularly vulnerable to the attack of adversarial samples. A novel target-specific sentiment classification method is proposed. Firstly, the method of masking target entities is applied to
