We introduce an approach called PLENARY (exPlaining bLack-box modEls in Natural lAnguage thRough fuzzY linguistic summaries), which is an explainable classifier based on a data-driven predictive model. Neural learning is exploited to derive a predictive model based on two levels of labels associated with the data. Then, model explanations are derived through the popular SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) tool and conveyed in a linguistic form via fuzzy linguistic …
