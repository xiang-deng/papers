Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in recommender systems and online advertising. The most critical step in this task is to perform feature interaction. Factorization machines are proposed to complete the second-order interaction of features to improve the prediction accuracy, but they are not competent for high-order feature interactions. In recent years, many state-of-the-art models employ shallow neural networks to capture high-order feature interactions to improve prediction Cites: Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with
