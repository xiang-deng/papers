Abstract Service recovery is still one of the most important methods that can be used to improve the reliability of their modern distribution system. After the error location has been located and isolated, a proper SR program needs to be established in order to refill areas that are now out of service. In order to find a solution that is both effective and quick in today s power supply systems, it is proposed to use two different heuristic approaches. In order to facilitate recovery in distribution systems
