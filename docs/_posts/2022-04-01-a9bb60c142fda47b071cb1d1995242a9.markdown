Automating video-based data and machine learning pipelines poses several challenges including metadata generation for efficient storage and retrieval and isolation of key-frames for scene understanding tasks. In this work, we present two semi-supervised approaches that automate this process of manual frame sifting in video streams by automatically classifying scenes for content and filtering frames for fine-tuning scene understanding tasks. The first rule-based method starts from a pre Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
