Remote sensing image analysis has drawn more attentions in the field of computer vision. At present, the methods commonly used in remote sensing image analysis are mainly at a low level semantically. The scene graph is an abstraction of objects and their relationships, which is a high level image understanding task. To fully comprehend the meanings of remote sensing images, in this paper, we propose a novel Segmentation-based model to generate Remote sensing image Scene Graphs …
