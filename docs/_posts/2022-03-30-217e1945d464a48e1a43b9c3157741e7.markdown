Recently, a shift has been made in the field of Outcome-Oriented Predictive Process Monitoring (OOPPM) to use models from the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence paradigm, however the evaluation still occurs mainly through performancebased metrics not accounting for the implications and lack of actionability of the explanations. In this paper, we define explainability by the interpretability of the explanations (through the widely-used XAI properties parsimony and functional Cites:   Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
