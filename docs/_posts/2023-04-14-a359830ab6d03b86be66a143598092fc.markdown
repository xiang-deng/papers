Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has made remarkable progress but usually requires delicate and fragile reward engineering. Modeling other agents (MOA) is an effective method for compensating for the absence of efficient reward signals. However, existing MOA methods often assume that only one agent can model other non-learning agents. In this study, we propose continuous mutual modeling (CMM), which constantly models other agents that also learn appropriate  Cites: Opponent modeling in deep reinforcement learning
