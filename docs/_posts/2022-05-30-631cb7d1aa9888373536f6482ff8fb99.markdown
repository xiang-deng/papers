Two-stream convolutional neural networks have been widely applied to action recognition. However, two-stream networks are usually adopted to capture spatial information and temporal information separately, which normally ignore the strong complementarity and correlation between spatial and temporal information in videos. To solve this problem, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Learning Two-stream network (STILT) for action recognition. Our proposed two-stream (ie, a spatial … Cites: ‪Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading‬
