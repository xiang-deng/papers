Various recent experimental results show that large language models (LLM) exhibit emergent abilities that are not present in small models. System performance is greatly improved after passing a certain critical threshold of scale. In this letter, we provide a simple explanation for such a phase transition phenomenon. For this, we model an LLM as a sequence-to-sequence random function. Instead of using instant generation at each step, we use a list decoder that keeps a list of candidate …
