The essence of named entity recognition is to mine entities with specific meanings in the text, which is the basis for some downstream tasks in the field of natural language processing. Currently, deep learning-based methods have further improved the accuracy of named entity recognition, and most methods are based on word-level and character-level embeddings. However, these methods ignore the effectiveness of global context for entity recognition, so this paper proposes to use an attention Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
