Abstract Prompt-Design on Pre-trained large Language Models (prompt-design&PLM) has become an emerging paradigm for a range of NLP tasks. Although an increased effort has been put into reformulating many classic NLP problems as prompt-based learning, less explored areas include knowledge base construction from PLMs. The ISWC-2022 challenge on Knowledge Base Construction from Pre-trained Language Models (KBC-LM) provides 12 pre-defined relations each of which Cites: BERTese: Learning to Speak to BERT
