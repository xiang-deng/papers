Retrieval augmentation has shown promising improvements in different tasks. However, whether such augmentation can assist a large language model based re-ranker remains unclear. We investigate how to augment T5-based re-rankers using high-quality information retrieved from two external corpora--a commercial web search engine and Wikipedia. We empirically demonstrate how retrieval augmentation can substantially improve the effectiveness of T5-based re-rankers for  Cites: LaMDA: Language Models for Dialog Applications
