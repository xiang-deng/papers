Computer vision systems today are primarily N-purpose systems, designed and trained for a predefined set of tasks. Adapting such systems to new tasks is challenging and often requires non-trivial modifications to the network architecture (eg adding new output heads) or training process (eg adding new losses). To reduce the time and expertise required to develop new applications, we would like to create general purpose vision systems that can learn and perform a range of tasks without Cites: Cross-task generalization via natural language crowdsourcing
