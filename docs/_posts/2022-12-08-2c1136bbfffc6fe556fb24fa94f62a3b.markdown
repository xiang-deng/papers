Automata-based representations play an important role in control and planning in sequential decision-making, but obtaining high-level task knowledge for building automata is often difficult. Although large-scale generative language models (GLMs) can help automatically distill task knowledge, the textual outputs from GLMs are not directly utilizable in sequential decision-making. We resolve this problem by proposing a novel algorithm named GLM2FSA, which obtains high-level task Cites: Symbolic knowledge distillation: from general language models to
