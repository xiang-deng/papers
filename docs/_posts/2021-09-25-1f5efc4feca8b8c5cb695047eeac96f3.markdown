This paper introduces a simple and effective form of data augmentation for recommender systems. A paraphrase similarity model is applied to widely available textual data, such as reviews and product descriptions, yielding new semantic relations that are added to the user-item graph. This increases the density of the graph without needing further labeled data. The data augmentation is evaluated on a variety of recommendation algorithms, using Euclidean, hyperbolic, and complex Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
