Batteries are vital energy storage carriers in industry and in our daily life. There is continued interest in the developments of batteries with excellent service performance and safety. Traditional trial-and-error experimental approaches have the limitations of high-cost and low-efficiency. Atomistic computational simulations are relatively expensive and take long time to screen massive materials. The rapid development of machine learning (ML) has brought innovations in many fields and Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
