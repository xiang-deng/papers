Research on neural networks has largely focused on understanding a single model trained on a single dataset. However, relatively little is known about the relationships between different models, especially those trained or tested on different datasets. We address this by studying how the weight space and underlying loss landscape of different models are interconnected. Specifically, we demonstrate that fine-tuned models that were optimized for high performance, reside in well-defined regions in  Cites: BoolQ: Exploring the surprising difficulty of natural yes/no questions
