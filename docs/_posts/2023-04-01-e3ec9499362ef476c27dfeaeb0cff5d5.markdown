In the lightweight convolutional neural network model, the pointwise convolutional structure occupies most of the parameters and computation amount of the model. Therefore, improving the pointwise convolution structure is the best choice to optimize the lightweight model. Aiming at the problem that the pointwise convolution in MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2 consumes too many computation resources, we designed the novel Ghost-PE and Ghost-PC blocks. First, in order to optimize the …
