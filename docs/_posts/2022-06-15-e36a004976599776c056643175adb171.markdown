We propose a novel parameterized skill-learning algorithm that aims to learn transferable parameterized skills and synthesize them into a new action space that supports efficient learning in long-horizon tasks. We first propose novel learning objectives--trajectory-centric diversity and smoothness--that allow an agent to meta-learn reusable parameterized skills. Our agent can use these learned skills to construct a temporally-extended parameterized-action Markov decision process, for …
