Recently, there is a revival of interest in low-rank matrix completion-based unsupervised learning through the lens of dual-graph regularization, which has significantly improved the performance of multidisciplinary machine learning tasks such as recommendation systems, genotype imputation and image inpainting. While the dual-graph regularization contributes a major part of the success, computational costly hyper-parameter tunning is usually involved.
