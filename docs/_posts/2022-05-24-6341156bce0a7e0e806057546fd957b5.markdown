Incorporating information from other languages can improve the results of tasks in low-resource languages. A powerful method of building functional natural language processing systems for low-resource languages is to combine multilingual pre-trained representations with cross-lingual transfer learning. In general, however, shared representations are learned separately, either across tasks or across languages. This paper proposes a meta-learning approach for inferring natural … Cites: ‪MetaXL: Meta Representation Transformation for Low-resource …‬
