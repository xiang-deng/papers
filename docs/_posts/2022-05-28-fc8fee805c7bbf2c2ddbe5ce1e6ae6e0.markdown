Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) enable machines to view the world as humans and become increasing prevalent for IoT applications. Instead of streaming the raw data to the cloud and executing CNN inference remotely, it would be very attractive to use local IoT devices to process as it enables IoT applications with independent decision-making ability. Since a single IoT device can hardly match the requirements of the CNN inference, especially for time-sensitive and high-accuracy … Cites: ‪Roberta: A robustly optimized bert pretraining approach‬
