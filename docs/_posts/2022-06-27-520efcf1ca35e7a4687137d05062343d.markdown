Contextual ranking models based on BERT are now well established for a wide range of passage and document ranking tasks. However, the robustness of BERT-based ranking models under adversarial inputs is under-explored. In this paper, we argue that BERT-rankers are not immune to adversarial attacks targeting retrieved documents given a query. Firstly, we propose algorithms for adversarial perturbation of both highly relevant and non-relevant documents using gradient-based  Cites: Universal adversarial triggers for attacking and analyzing NLP
