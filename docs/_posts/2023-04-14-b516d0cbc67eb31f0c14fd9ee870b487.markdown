Recently, PLMs (pre-trained language models) and syntax-based GCNs (graph convolutional neural networks) have been widely and deeply applied in aspectbased sentiment analysis, effectively promoting the development of this field. However, these methods rarely make use of external knowledge, such as knowledge of high-quality sentiment lexicons, which can be a powerful complement to these methods if the prior knowledge can be effectively used. In this paper, to use external knowledge …
