Transformer models have achieved impressive results in various AI scenarios, ranging from vision to natural language processing. However, their computational complexity and their vast number of parameters hinder their implementations on resource-constrained platforms. Furthermore, while loosely-coupled hardware accelerators have been proposed in the literature, data transfer costs limit their speed-up potential. We address this challenge along two axes. First, we introduce Cites: Well-Read Students Learn Better: On the Importance of Pre
