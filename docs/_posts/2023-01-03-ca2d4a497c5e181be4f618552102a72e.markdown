The importance of studying double-diffusive fluid flows along with the significance of non-Newtonian fluids have been well recognized in the fluid dynamics field for scientific and practical purposes. However, and given the ever-rising complexity of such non-linear flows, the conventional simulation methods are confronted with problems related to accuracy and required computation time and resources. As a result, the Machine Learning approach qualifies as a promising solution to said Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
