This paper describes our results for the three tasks at ChEMU 2022: Task 1a (named entity recognition), Task 1b (event extraction), and Task 1c (anaphora resolution). We adopted a hybrid approach using deep learning models and a small set of post-processing rules for these tasks. For Tasks 1b and 1c, we adopted a pipeline approach for relation extraction, which combined mention detection with relation classification. In addition, we proposed post-processing methods for Task 1c that Cites: AllenNLP: A Deep Semantic Natural Language Processing Platform
