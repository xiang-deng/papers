While the modeling of pair-wise relations has been widely studied in multi-agent interacting systems, its ability to capture higher-level and larger-scale group-wise activities is limited. In this paper, we propose a group-aware relational reasoning approach (named EvolveHypergraph) with explicit inference of the underlying dynamically evolving relational structures, and we demonstrate its effectiveness for multi-agent trajectory prediction. In addition to the edges between a pair of nodes (ie Cites: Introduction to statistical relational learning
