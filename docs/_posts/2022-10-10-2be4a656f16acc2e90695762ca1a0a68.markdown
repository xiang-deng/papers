We apply qualitative analysis on 3,004 Python files used to implement 103 supervised learning-based software projects. We identify a list of 54 log-related coding patterns that map to 6 attacks related to supervised learning algorithms. Using Log Assistant to conduct Postmortems for Supervised Learning (LOPSUL), we quantify the frequency of the identified log-related coding patterns with 278 open source software projects that use supervised learning. We observe log-related Cites: Thieves on Sesame Street! Model Extraction of BERT-based APIs
