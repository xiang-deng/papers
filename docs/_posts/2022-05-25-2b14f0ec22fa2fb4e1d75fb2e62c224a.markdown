In this paper, we propose semantic supervision (SemSup)-a unified paradigm for training classifiers that generalize over output spaces. In contrast to standard classification, which treats classes as discrete symbols, SemSup represents them as dense vector features obtained from descriptions of classes (eg,  The cat is a small carnivorous mammal ). This allows the output space to be unbounded (in the space of descriptions) and enables models to generalize both over unseen inputs and … Cites: ‪Well-read students learn better: On the importance of pre-training …‬
