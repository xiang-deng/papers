Dataset biases are notoriously detrimental to model robustness and generalization. The identify-emphasize paradigm appears to be effective in dealing with unknown biases. However, we discover that it is still plagued by two challenges: A, the quality of the identified bias-conflicting samples is far from satisfactory; B, the emphasizing strategies only produce suboptimal performance. In this paper, for challenge A, we propose an effective bias-conflicting scoring method (ECS) to boost the identification  Cites: Learning to model and ignore dataset bias with mixed capacity
