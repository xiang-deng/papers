Knowledge graphs are large, graph-structured databases used in many use-case scenarios such as Intelligent Environments. Many Artificial Intelligent latent feature models are used to infer new facts in Knowledge Graphs. Despite their success, the lack of interpretability remains a challenge to overcome. This paper applies influence functions to obtain the most significant facts when predicting new knowledge and allows users to understand these models. However, Influence Functions do not scale Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
