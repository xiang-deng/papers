This thesis studies the information that an expression and its context contribute to ambiguity resolution, focusing on the syntactic, lexical, and referential levels, and on the English language. I adopt computational linguistics, in particular deep learning methods, as my research framework, by introducing methodologies to 1) analyze deep learning models, and 2) use them for linguistic analysis. In a subset of studies, I investigate how neural language modelstrained from unlabeled text corpora Cites: Composition in distributional models of semantics
