In this discussion paper, we survey recent research surrounding robustness of machine learning models. As learning algorithms become increasingly more popular in data-driven control systems, their robustness to data uncertainty must be ensured in order to maintain reliable safety-critical operations. We begin by reviewing common formalisms for such robustness, and then move on to discuss popular and state-of-the-art techniques for training robust machine learning models as well as Cites: Semidefinite relaxations for certifying robustness to adversarial
