We introduce a task consisting in matching a proof to a given mathematical statement. The task fits well within current research on Mathematical Information Retrieval and, more generally, mathematical article analysis (Mathematical Sciences, 2014). We present a dataset for the task (the MATCH dataset) consisting of over 180k statement-proof pairs extracted from modern mathematical research articles. 1 We find this dataset highly representative of our task, as it consists of relatively new  Cites: Naturalproofs: Mathematical theorem proving in natural language
