Recent advances in neural network language models have shown that it is possible to derive expressive meaning representations by leveraging linguistic associations in large-scale natural language data. These potentially Gestalt representations have enabled state-of-the-art performance for many practical applications. It would appear that we are on a pathway to empirically deriving a robust and expressive computable semantics. A key question that arises is how far can language data alone enable Cites: Beyond the Imitation Game: Quantifying and extrapolating the
