Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with numerical node features and graph structure as inputs have demonstrated superior performance on various supervised learning tasks with graph data. However the numerical node features utilized by GNNs are commonly extracted from raw data which is of text or tabular (numeric/categorical) type in most real-world applications. The best models for such data types in most standard supervised learning settings with IID (non-graph) data are not simple neural Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
