An in-vehicle intrusion detection system (IV-IDS) is one of the protection mechanisms used to detect cyber attacks on electric or autonomous vehicles where anomaly-based IDS solution have better potential at detecting the attacks especially zero-day attacks. Generally, the IV-IDS generate false alarms (falsely detecting normal data as attacks) because of the difficulty to differentiate between normal and attack data. It can lead to undesirable situations, such as increased laxness towards the system, or
