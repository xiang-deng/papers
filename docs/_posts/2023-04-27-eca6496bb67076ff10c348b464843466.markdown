Unsupervised person re-identification aims to distinguish different pedestrians from discriminative representations on the basis of unlabeled data. Currently, most unsupervised Re-ID approaches explore visual representations to generate pseudo-labels for model s training, which may suffer from background noise and semantic loss. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a High-level Semantic Property driven Multi-task Feature Learning Network (HSP-MFL) to firstly introduce three high Cites: VL-Adapter: Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for Vision-and
