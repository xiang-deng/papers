Modeling from data usually has two distinct facets: building sound explanatory models or creating powerful predictive models for a system or phenomenon.

In spite of this relationship, most recent data-modeling work fits into the allin-one machine learning methodology, with the basic assumption that all  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
