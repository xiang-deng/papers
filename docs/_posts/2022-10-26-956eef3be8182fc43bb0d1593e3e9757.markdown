Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in artificial intelligence (AI) thanks to refined deep network structures, powerful computing devices, and large-scale labeled datasets. However, researchers have mainly invested in the optimization of models and computational devices, leading to the fact that good models and powerful computing devices are currently readily available, while datasets are still stuck at the initial stage of large-scale but low quality.
