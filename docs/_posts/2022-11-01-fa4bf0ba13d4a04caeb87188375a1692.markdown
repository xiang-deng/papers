Generalized variables make it possible to reveal the nuances of the structure of porous materials and divide samples into their series with similar properties (Titelman, L. AMPC 2021, vol. 11, No. 11). Adsorbents for gas storage have a unique set of variables that can be combined: textural and mechanical properties of the adsorbent, preparation conditions, pressure and temperature of gas during storage and delivery. Taking gas pressure and mechanical strength as forces, textural …
