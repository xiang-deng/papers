Text-to-SQL task maps natural language utterances to structured queries that can be issued to a database. State-of-the-art (SOTA) systems rely on finetuning large, pre-trained language models in conjunction with constrained decoding applying a SQL parser. On the well established Spider dataset, we begin with Oracle studies: specifically, choosing an Oracle hypothesis from a SOTA model s 10-best list, yields a $7.7\% $ absolute improvement in both exact match (EM) and execution (EX) Cites: Unifiedskg: Unifying and multi-tasking structured knowledge
