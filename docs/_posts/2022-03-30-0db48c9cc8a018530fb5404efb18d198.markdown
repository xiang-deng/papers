Abstract Internet of Things (IoT) devices have flocked the whole world through the Internet. With increasing mission-critical IoT data traffic, attacks on IoT networks have also increased. Many newly crafted attacks on IoT communication require equally intelligent intrusion detection methods to form the first step of countering the attacks. Our work contributes to intrusion detection in IoT networks, by putting state-of-the-art Deep learning methods into service.
