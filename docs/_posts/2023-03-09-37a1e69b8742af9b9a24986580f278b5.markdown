We examine the state-of-the-art neural network (NN) approach and its flexible implementations in combustion reaction model uncertainty quantification (UQ), optimization, and uncertainty minimization (UM). The work is motivated by addressing the problem of limited scalability of the traditional polynomial response surface methodology in handling large size of rate parameters and target data sets. Features of the NN training, accuracy, and trade-offs in several key aspects of the NN …
