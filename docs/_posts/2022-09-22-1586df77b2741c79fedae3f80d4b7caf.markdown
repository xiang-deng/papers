In 2011, we proposed PathSim to systematically define and compute similarity between nodes in a heterogeneous information network (HIN), where nodes and links are from different types. In the PathSim paper, we for the first time introduced HIN with general network schema and proposed the concept of meta-paths to systematically define new relation types between nodes. In this paper, we summarize the impact of PathSim paper in both academia and industry. We start from the Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
