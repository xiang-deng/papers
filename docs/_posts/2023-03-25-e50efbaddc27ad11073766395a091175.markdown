Most of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) models currently used in energy forecasting are traditional and deterministic. Recently, a novel deep learning paradigm, called  transformer , has been developed, which adopts the mechanism of self-attention. Transformers are designed to better process and predict sequential data sets (ie, historical time records) as well as to track any relationship in the sequential data. So far, a few transformer-based applications have been established, but no industry …
