Benefiting from language flexibility and compositionality, humans naturally intend to use language to command an embodied agent for complex tasks such as navigation and object manipulation. In this work, we aim to fill the blank of the last mile of embodied agents--object manipulation by following human guidance, eg,  move the red mug next to the box while keeping it upright.  To this end, we introduce an Automatic Manipulation Solver (AMSolver) simulator and build a Vision-and …
