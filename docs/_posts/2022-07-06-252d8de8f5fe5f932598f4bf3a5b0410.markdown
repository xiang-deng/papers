Accurate pavement performance forecasting is critical in supporting transportation agencies  predictive maintenance strategies: programs that prolong pavement service life while using fewer resources. However, because of the complex nature of pavement deterioration, high accuracy for long-term and project-level pavement performance forecasting is challenging to traditional models. Therefore, researchers have taken advantage of machine learning (ML) technology to create more  Cites: Empirical evaluation of gated recurrent neural networks on
