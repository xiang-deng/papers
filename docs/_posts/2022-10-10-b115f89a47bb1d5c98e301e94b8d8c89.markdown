Modern AI-assisted approaches have revolutionized our abilities to better understand the properties of concrete and composite materials. However, current machine learning models such as supervised learning (SL) models usually require a large amount of training data to feed the model. Here, we introduce self-supervised learning (SSL) to address the issue of lacking labeled data in concrete material characterization. We propose a generalized SSL-based framework with domain Cites: Emergent linguistic structure in artificial neural networks trained by
