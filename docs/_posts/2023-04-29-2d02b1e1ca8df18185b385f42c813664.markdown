Evidence-aware fake news detection aims to conduct reasoning between news and evidence, which is retrieved based on news content, to find uniformity or inconsistency. However, we find evidence-aware detection models suffer from biases, ie, spurious correlations between news/evidence contents and true/fake news labels, and are hard to be generalized to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) situations. To deal with this, we propose a novel Dual Adversarial Learning (DAL) approach  Cites: Fine-grained fact verification with kernel graph attention network
