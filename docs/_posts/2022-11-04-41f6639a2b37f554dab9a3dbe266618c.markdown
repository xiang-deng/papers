Multi-vector retrieval models improve over single-vector dual encoders on many information retrieval tasks. In this paper, we cast the multi-vector retrieval problem as sparse alignment between query and document tokens. We propose AligneR, a novel multi-vector retrieval model that learns sparsified pairwise alignments between query and document tokens (egdog vs.puppy ) and per-token unary saliences reflecting their relative importance for retrieval. We show that controlling the sparsity Cites: Unsupervised dense information retrieval with contrastive learning
