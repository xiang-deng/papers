This paper presents a portable toolkit, SwitchNet, for extracting relations from textual input. We summarize four data protocols for relation extraction tasks, including relation classification, relation extraction, triple extraction, and distant supervision relation extraction. This neural architecture is modular, so it can take as input data at different stages of the information extraction process (simple text, text and entities or entity pairs as relation candidates) and compute the rest of the process (named entity Cites: Graph convolution over pruned dependency trees improves
