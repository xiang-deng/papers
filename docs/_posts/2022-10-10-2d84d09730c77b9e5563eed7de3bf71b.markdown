Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained task that detects the sentiment polarities of particular aspect words in a sentence. With the rise of graph convolution networks (GCNs), current ABSA models mostly use graph-based methods. These methods construct a dependency tree for each sentence, and regard each word as a unique node. To be more specific, they conduct classification using aspect representations instead of sentence representations, and update them with  Cites: RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach
