In supervised computer vision tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated superiority over alternative methods. However, training and validating these models requires large-scale labeled datasets, which are generated using specific expert knowledge and are expensive. With the limitation of a limited labeling budget, active learning is a promising approach for generating labeled datasets. The conventional methods used for active learning only consider a pool of unlabeled  Cites: Selection via proxy: Efficient data selection for deep learning
