Programming-by-Examples (PBE) involves synthesizing an intended program from a small set of user-provided input-output examples. A key PBE strategy has been to restrict the search to a carefully designed small domain-specific language (DSL) with effectively-invertible (EI) operators at the top and effectively-enumerable (EE) operators at the bottom. This facilitates an effective combination of top-down synthesis strategy (which backpropagates outputs over various paths in the DSL  Cites: Spreadsheetcoder: Formula prediction from semi-structured context
