Transformer, a new type of neural network based on the self-attention mechanism, has revolutionized the field of natural language processing. Since Transformer has a more powerful representation ability than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), researchers are trying to apply it to computer vision tasks. In the past, most of the review papers summarized Transformers in the field of computer vision and natural language processing, respectively, which isolates the relationship between the two Cites: SpanBERT: Improving Pre-training by Representing and Predicting
