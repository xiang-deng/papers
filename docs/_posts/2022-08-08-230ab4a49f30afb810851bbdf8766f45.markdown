This paper investigates a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach for autonomous driving. Since interpretability is essential for such a high-stake domain, in contrast to previous deep RL work, we exploit a recent neuro-symbolic model called differentiable logic machine to learn an interpretable controller in the form of a first-order logic program. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on two classical decision-making scenarios in autonomous driving: lane Cites: Neural logic machines
