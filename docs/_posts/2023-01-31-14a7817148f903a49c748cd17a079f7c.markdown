The deeper the deep learning (DL) models are, the more computational complexity in need of the vast amount of data training requires to get better performance with accurate results. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have obtained tremendous attention from many researchers with their impressive generation of synthetic instance data via a few source data by alleviating the problems of data scarcity, insufficient data diversity, and producing only limited plausible alternative data using …
