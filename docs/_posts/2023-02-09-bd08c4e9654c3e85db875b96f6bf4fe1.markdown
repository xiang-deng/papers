Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) have been extensively applied to real-world tasks, such as recommendation systems, social networks, and citation networks. While existing HIN representation learning methods can effectively learn the semantic and structural features in the network, little awareness was given to the distribution discrepancy of subgraphs within a single HIN. However, we find that ignoring such distribution discrepancy among subgraphs from multiple sources …
