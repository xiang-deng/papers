People are becoming accustomed to posting images and captions on social media platforms to express their opinions. Hence, Visual-Caption Sentiment Recognition (VCSR) has been a subject of growing attention recently. Thus, the correlation between visual and caption modalities is crucial for VCSR. However, most recent VCSR strategies concatenate features from the visual and caption modalities with the help of pre-trained deep learning models containing millions of trainable parameters Cites: Document modeling with gated recurrent neural network for
