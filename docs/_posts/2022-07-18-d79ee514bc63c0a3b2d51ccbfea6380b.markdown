Industry 4.0 process fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is built on the foundations of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for sensing and artificial intelligence for recognizing patterns. Despite the performance and application of various learning-based algorithms in multiple sectors, their black-box nature makes industrial experts skeptical. So, this paper proposes an eXplainable Fault Detection, Diagnosis, and Correction (XFDDC) Framework to create best-fit FDD models that are explainable  Cites: " Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any
