Parameter efficient learning methods (PERMs) have recently gained significant attention as they provide an efficient way for pre-trained language models (PLMs) to adapt to a downstream task. However, these conclusions are mostly drawn from in-domain evaluations over the full training set. In this paper, we present comparisons between PERMs and finetuning from three new perspectives:(1) the effect of sample and model size to in-domain evaluations,(2) generalization to unseen domains and …
