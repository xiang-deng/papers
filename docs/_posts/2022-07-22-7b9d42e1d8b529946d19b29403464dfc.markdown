Macro placement is the problem of placing memory blocks on a chip canvas. It can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem over sequence pairs, a representation which describes the relative positions of macros. Solving this problem is particularly challenging since the objective function is expensive to evaluate. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to macro placement using Bayesian optimization (BO) over sequence pairs. BO is a machine learning technique that uses  Cites: Azade Nazi, Jiwoo Pak, Andy Tong, Kavya Srinivasa, William Hang
