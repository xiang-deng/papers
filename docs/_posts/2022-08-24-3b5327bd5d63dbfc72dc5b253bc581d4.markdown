A non-destructive and rapid moisture content detection method of sand gravel material is required in loose material dams. The near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of sand materials is closely related to its moisture content. Recently, there is a growing need for fully using spectral information when establishing calibration models for sand gravel moisture content detection. To address these issues, a hybrid one dimensional-convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and attention-based Cites: Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder
