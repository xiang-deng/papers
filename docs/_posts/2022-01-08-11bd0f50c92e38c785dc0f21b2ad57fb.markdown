Automatic tree species classification based on remote-sensing images can significantly improve the efficiency of tree species investigation and save considerable cost of human labor. A fully convolutional network (FCN) can automatically extract tree species-related features to achieve higher classification performance. However, this kind of method needs a large quantity of training data. Due to few samples and unbalanced sample distribution of tree species remote Cites: ESPNetv2: A Light-weight, Power Efficient, and General Purpose
