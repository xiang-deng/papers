Foodenergywater (FEW) nexus analyses are critical to sustainable development. Nexus analyses form a unique multiagent decision-making arena that requires using a system engineering approach to simultaneously improve food and water security as well as energy efficiency. To tackle the complexity in decision making within a FEW nexus with respect to dynamic behaviors and interactive logics, we model the FEW nexus as a multiagent system (MAS) under a mixed competitive and Cites: Opponent modeling in deep reinforcement learning
