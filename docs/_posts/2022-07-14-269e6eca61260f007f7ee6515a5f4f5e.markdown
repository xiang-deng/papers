Applying deep learning methods to solve high-dimensional and nonlinear differential equations (DE) has raised much attention recently. A goal of using machine learning in systems of differential equations is to train a surrogate model with prior physics information and generate predictions with stability and accuracy. However, training such models for high-dimensional/nonlinear multi-scale ODE or PDE systems with limited or labeled data is a grant challenge; and the proper design of the architecture …
