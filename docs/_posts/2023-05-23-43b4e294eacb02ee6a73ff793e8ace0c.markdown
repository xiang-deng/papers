We investigate the use of transformer sequence models as dynamics models (TDMs) for control. In a number of experiments in the DeepMind control suite, we find that first, TDMs perform well in a single-environment learning setting when compared to baseline models. Second, TDMs exhibit strong generalization capabilities to unseen environments, both in a few-shot setting, where a generalist model is fine-tuned with small amounts of data from the target environment, and in a zero-shot setting, where Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
