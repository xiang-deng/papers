One of the key challenges of knowledge base question answering (KBQA) is the multi-hop reasoning. Since in different hops, one attends to different parts of question, it is important to dynamically represent the question semantics for each hop. Existing methods, however,(i) infer the dynamic question representation only through coarse-grained attention mechanisms, which may bring information loss,(ii) and have not effectively modeled the sequential logic, which is crucial for the multi  Cites: The web as a knowledge-base for answering complex questions
