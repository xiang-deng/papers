Document distance is a fundamental yet significant research topic in the information retrieval community, and its accuracy dominates the performance of many text retrieval applications. Beyond the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model, the Word Mover s Distance (WMD) semantically defines the distance between documents as the minimum cost (ie measured by word similarities of embeddings) required to transport the words from one document to another, and it has been proven to be superior by k  Cites: Detecting formal thought disorder by deep contextualized word
