Semantic search for candidate retrieval is an important yet neglected problem in retrieval-based Chatbots, which aims to select a bunch of candidate responses efficiently from a large pool. The existing bottleneck is to ensure the model architecture having two points: 1) rich interactions between a query and a response to produce query-relevant responses; 2) ability of separately projecting the query and the response into latent spaces to apply efficiently in semantic search during online Cites: Cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction with graph lstms
