Data anonymization is often a task carried out by humans. Automating it would reduce the cost and time required to complete this task. This paper presents a pipeline to automate the anonymization of audio data in French. We propose a pipeline, which takes audio files with their transcriptions and removes the named entities (NEs) present in the audio. Our pipeline is made up of a forced aligner, which aligns words in an audio transcript with speech and a model that performs named Cites: Findings of the First Shared Task on Machine Translation
