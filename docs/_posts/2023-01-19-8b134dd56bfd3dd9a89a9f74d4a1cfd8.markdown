Large Language Models (LLMs) have been making big waves in the machine learning community within the past few years. The impressive scalability of LLMs due to the advent of deep learning can be seen as a continuation of empiricist lingusitic methods, as opposed to rule-based linguistic methods that are grounded in a nativist perspective. Current LLMs are generally inaccessible to resource-constrained researchers, due to a variety of factors including closed source code. This work …
