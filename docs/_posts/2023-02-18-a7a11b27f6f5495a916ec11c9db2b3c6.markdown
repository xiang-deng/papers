Meta-learning methods have been widely used in few-shot named entity recognition (NER), especially prototype-based methods. However, the Other (O) class is difficult to be represented by a prototype vector because there are generally a large number of samples in the class that have miscellaneous semantics. To solve the problem, we propose MeTNet, which generates prototype vectors for entity types only but not O-class. We design an improved triplet network to map samples and prototype vectors …
