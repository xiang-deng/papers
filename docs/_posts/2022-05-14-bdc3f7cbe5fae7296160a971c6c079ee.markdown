Breast cancer is the most widely recognized malignancy affecting women. The risk of death has been consistently associated with breast cancer. In addition, the cyber- physical system (CPS) is the processing and data transfer of physical processes. This study presents a safe, intrusive, blockchain-based data transfer using the CPS classification model in the health industry to overcome the problem. Considering the challenges in breast tumor classification, this paper accords a Cites: Deep neural networks improve radiologists performance in breast
