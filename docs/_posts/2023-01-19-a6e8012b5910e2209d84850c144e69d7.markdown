Text classification is widely studied in natural language processing (NLP). Deep learning models, including large pre-trained models like BERT and DistilBERT, have achieved impressive results in text classification tasks. However, these models robustness against adversarial attacks remains an area of concern. To address this concern, we propose three data augmentation methods to improve the robustness of such pre-trained models. We evaluated our methods on four text classification Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
