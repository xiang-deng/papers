Many generative foundation models (or GFMs) are trained on publicly available data and use public infrastructure, but 1) may degrade the digital commons that they depend on, and 2) do not have processes in place to return value captured to data producers and stakeholders. Existing conceptions of data rights and protection (focusing largely on individually-owned data and associated privacy concerns) and copyright or licensing-based models offer some instructive priors, but are ill-suited for Cites: Do neural language models overcome reporting bias?
