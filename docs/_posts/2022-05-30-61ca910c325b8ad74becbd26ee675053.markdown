Open relation extraction (ORE) aims to assign semantic relationships between arguments, essential to the automatic construction of knowledge graphs. The previous methods either depend on external NLP tools (eg, PoS-taggers) and language-specific relation formations, or suffer from inherent problems in sequence representations, thus leading to unsatisfactory extraction in diverse languages and domains. To address the above problems, we propose a Query-based Open R Cites: Open information extraction from the web
