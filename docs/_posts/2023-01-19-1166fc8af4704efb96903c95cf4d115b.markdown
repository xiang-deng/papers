Automatically localizing a position based on a few natural language instructions is essential for future robots to communicate and collaborate with humans. To approach this goal, we focus on the text-to-point-cloud cross-modal localization problem. Given a textual query, it aims to identify the described location from city-scale point clouds. The task involves two challenges. 1) In city-scale point clouds, similar ambient instances may exist in several locations.
