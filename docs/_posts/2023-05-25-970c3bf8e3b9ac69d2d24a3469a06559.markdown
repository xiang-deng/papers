Explaining the decisions of neural models is crucial for ensuring their trustworthiness at deployment time. Using Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) to justify a model s predictions has recently gained increasing interest. However, this approach usually demands large datasets of human-written NLEs for the ground-truth answers, which are expensive and potentially infeasible for some applications. For models to generate high-quality NLEs when only a few NLEs are available, the fine-tuning of Cites: CommonsenseQA: A Question Answering Challenge Targeting
