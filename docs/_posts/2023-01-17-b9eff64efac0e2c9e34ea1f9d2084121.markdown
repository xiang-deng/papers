This paper investigates the existence of a representative subset obtained from a large original dataset that can achieve the same performance level obtained using the entire dataset in the context of training neural language models. We employ the likelihood-based scoring method based on two distinct types of pre-trained language models to select a representative subset. We conduct our experiments on widely used 17 natural language processing datasets with 24 evaluation metrics. The  Cites: Detecting formal thought disorder by deep contextualized word
