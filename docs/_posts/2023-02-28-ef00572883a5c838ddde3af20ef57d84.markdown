Most existing state-of-the-art neural network models for math word problems use the Goal-driven Tree-Structured decoder (GTS) to generate expression trees. However, we found that GTS does not provide good predictions for longer expressions, mainly because it does not capture the relationships among the goal vectors of each node in the expression tree and ignores the position order of the nodes before and after the operator. In this paper, we propose a novel Recursive tree-structured neural network  Cites: Electra: Pre-training text encoders as discriminators rather than
