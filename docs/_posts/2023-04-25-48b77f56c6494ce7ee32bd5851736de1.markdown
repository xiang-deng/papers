The recent evolution of NLP has enriched the set of DL-based approaches to include a number of generalpurpose Large Language Models (LLMs). Whereas new models have been proven useful for generic text handling, their applicability to domain-specific NLP tasks still remains doubtful, particularly because of the limited amount of dataset available in certain domains, such as Requirements Engineering. In this study, different pre-trained embeddings were tested in three requirements …
