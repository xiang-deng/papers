Information Extraction, which aims to extract structural relational triple or event from unstructured texts, often suffers from data scarcity issues. With the development of pre-trained language models, many prompt-based approaches to data-efficient information extraction have been proposed and achieved impressive performance. However, existing prompt learning methods for information extraction are still susceptible to several potential limitations:(i) semantic gap between natural …
