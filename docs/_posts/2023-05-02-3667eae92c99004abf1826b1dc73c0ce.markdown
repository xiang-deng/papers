Temporal Knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning aims to predict missing facts based on historical TKG data. Most of the existing methods are incapable of explicitly modeling the long-term time dependencies from history and neglect the adaptive integration of the long-and short-term information. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel method that utilizes a designed Hierarchical Relational Graph Neural Network to learn the Long-and Short-term representations for TKG reasoning, namely HGLS Cites: Compare to the knowledge: Graph neural fake news detection with
