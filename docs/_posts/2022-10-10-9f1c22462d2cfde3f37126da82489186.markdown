Recently, many efforts have been devoted to exploring deep learning approaches for various prediction tasks and remarkable success has been achieved with the advance of computation power and the help of huge amount of high quality labels. Despite the achievements made by the deep learning models in those prediction tasks, the investigation of leveraging auxiliary information is still underexplored. The auxiliary information refers to additional information besides the necessary features …
