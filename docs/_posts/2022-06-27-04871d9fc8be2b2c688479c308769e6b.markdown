This thesis presents a highly compact neural network model optimized for FPGAimplementations, targeting real-time cloud detection from RGB satellite images. Our model uses an encoder and decoder structure without skip connections, and uses piecewise linear activation functions for low-resource hardware implementations. Detecting Clouds from images using deep learning has made a lot of progress with image recognition and computer vision, at the cost of intensive …
