Although text classification performance has been greatly improved with the capability of deep learning based language models, the cost of building labeled training data is still a significant burden. To address this issue, pseudo-labeling based weakly supervised text classification models have attracted significant attention. However, prior works on weakly-supervised classification usually assume that each unlabeled sample belongs to one and only one of the target classes. Such …
