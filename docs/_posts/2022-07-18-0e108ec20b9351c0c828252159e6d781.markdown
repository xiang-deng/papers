The emergence of powerful deep learning systems has largely displaced classical symbolic algebraic models of linguistic representation in computational linguistics. While deep neural networks have achieved impressive results across a wide variety of AI and NLP tasks, they have become increasingly opaque and inaccessible to a clear understanding of how they acquire the generalisations that they extract from the data to which they apply. This is particularly true of BERT, and similar non-directional …
