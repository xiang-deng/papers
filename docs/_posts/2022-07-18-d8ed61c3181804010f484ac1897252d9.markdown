Sentence-level relation classification is a technique for classifying the relation between the head entity and the tail entity in a sentence. Currently, it is popularly used to realize relation classification based on deep learning methods. However, these methods rely heavily on large-scale annotated data, and the role of head and tail entities information is not fully explored. In response to the above problems, we propose a prototypical networks model based on entity convolution for relation Cites: Benefits of Intermediate Annotations in Reading Comprehension
