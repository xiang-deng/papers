Nowadays, data is represented by vectors. Retrieving those vectors, among millions and billions, that are similar to a given query is a ubiquitous problem of relevance for a wide range of applications. In this work, we present new techniques for creating faster and smaller indices to run these searches. To this end, we introduce a novel vector compression method, Locally-adaptive Vector Quantization (LVQ), that simultaneously reduces memory footprint and improves search performance, with …
