The ability of reasoning over evidence has received increasing attention in question answering (QA). Recently, natural language database (NLDB) conducts complex QA in knowledge base with textual evidences rather than structured representations, this task attracts a lot of attention because of the flexibility and richness of textual evidence. However, existing text-based complex question answering datasets fail to provide explicit reasoning process, while it s important for retrieval effectiveness and  Cites: Multi-hop Question Answering via Reasoning Chains
