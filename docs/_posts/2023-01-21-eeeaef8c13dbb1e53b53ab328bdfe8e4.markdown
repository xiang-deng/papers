For real-time target classification, a study was conducted to improve the AI-based target classification performance using RCS measurements that are vulnerable to noise, but can be obtained quickly. To compensate for the shortcomings of the RCS, a 1D CNNGRU network with strengths in feature extraction and time-series processing was considered. The 1D CNNGRU was experimentally changed and designed to fit the RCS characteristics. The performance of the proposed 1D CNN  Cites: Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for
