Black-box prompt tuning uses derivative-free optimization algorithms to learn prompts in low-dimensional subspaces instead of back-propagating through the network of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies have found that black-box prompt tuning lacks versatility across tasks and LLMs, which we believe is related to the inappropriate choice of subspaces. In this paper, we propose Black-box prompt tuning with Subspace Learning (BSL) to improve the versatility of black  Cites: On transferability of prompt tuning for natural language processing
