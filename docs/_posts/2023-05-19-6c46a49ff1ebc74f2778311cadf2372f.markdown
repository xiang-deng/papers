In this study, we investigate using graph neural network (GNN) representations to enhance contextualized representations of pre-trained language models (PLMs) for keyphrase extraction from lengthy documents. We show that augmenting a PLM with graph embeddings provides a more comprehensive semantic understanding of words in a document, particularly for long documents. We construct a co-occurrence graph of the text and embed it using a graph convolutional network (GCN) trained on …
