Text segmentation, a pre-processing step present in most NLP pipelines, is a rich topic that tends to get little attention in most NLP studies. We provide a brief empirical account on whether the choice of a particular segmentation algorithm (BPE, SentencePiece, WordPiece, Unigram, Morfessor) has an effect on the performance on downstream tasks, without transfer learning: natural language inference (SNLI), and sentiment classification (SST2). In contrast to previous studies which have  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
