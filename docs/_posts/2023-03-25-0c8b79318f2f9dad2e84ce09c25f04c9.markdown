Shear strength criterion for rock discontinuities is a greatly important issue to most geoengineering analyses and designs. This paper aims to develop criteria and make a comparative study using statistical, lazy, and ensemble learning methods for fast predicting the shear strength of rock discontinuities. To do so, simple linear regression (SLR), multiple linear regression (MLR), least median squared regression (LMSR), isotonic regression (IR), pace regression (PR), k-nearest neighbors (kNN) …
