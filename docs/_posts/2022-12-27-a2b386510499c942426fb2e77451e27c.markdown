Software vulnerability detection is one of the most challenging tasks faced by reverse engineers. Recently, vulnerability detection has received a lot of attention due to a drastic increase in the volume and complexity of software. Reverse engineering is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process for detecting malware and software vulnerabilities. However, with the advent of deep learning and machine learning, it has become possible for researchers to automate the process of identifying potential Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
