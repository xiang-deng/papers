Recent research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can utilize external tools to improve their contextual processing abilities, moving away from the pure language modeling paradigm and paving the way for Artificial General Intelligence. Despite this, there has been a lack of systematic evaluation to demonstrate the efficacy of LLMs using tools to respond to human instructions. This paper presents API-Bank, the first benchmark tailored for Tool-Augmented LLMs. API-Bank includes …
