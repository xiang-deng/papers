It is well known that a word vector is able to solve analogy tests by vector arithmetic, implying that semantic relations are embedded into the vector space and represented geometrically as a parallelogram. Motivated by Harris  structural linguistic view, this study aims to (1) clarify the distributional structure and semantic properties manifested in the distributed representation of words,(2) mathematically formulate the latent structure of the word co-occurrence matrix which is used to learn …
