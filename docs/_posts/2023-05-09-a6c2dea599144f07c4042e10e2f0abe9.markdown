Abstract Knowledge graphs (KGs) are networks of real-world entities with their relationships and properties and are more and more used as a means for the integration of heterogeneous sources of information in a common model that facilitates the interoperability of different applications and generates a huge quantity of information that can be exploited for machine learning predictions. Many approaches were proposed for the construction of KGs starting from tables extracted …
