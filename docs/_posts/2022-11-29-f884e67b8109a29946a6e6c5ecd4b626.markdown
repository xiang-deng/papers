This chapter explores the application of language models to programming languages and our work in constructing a dataset for the task. More particularly, we focus on the Keras programming language, a popular framework for implementing Deep Learning experiments. Our original model KerasBERT has since been expanded by adding more data and re-training the language model. The original KerasBERT model was trained on two categories of Keras Code Examples and the …
