It s common for current methods in skeleton-based action recognition to mainly consider capturing long-term temporal dependencies as skeleton sequences are typically long (> 128 frames), which forms a challenging problem for previous approaches. In such conditions, short-term dependencies are few formally considered, which are critical for classifying similar actions. Most current approaches are consisted of interleaving spatial-only modules and temporal-only modules Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
