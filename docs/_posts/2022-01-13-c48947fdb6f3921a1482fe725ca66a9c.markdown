As humans, we navigate the world through all our senses, using perceptual input from each one to correct the others.

Given a video, we replace snippets of text and audio with a MASK token; the model learns by choosing the correct masked-out snippet. Our objective learns faster than alternatives, and performs well at scale: we Cites: Mixout: Effective regularization to finetune large-scale pretrained
