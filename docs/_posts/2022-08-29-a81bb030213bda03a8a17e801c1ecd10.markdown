Multi-scenario recommendation is dedicated to retrieve relevant items for users in multiple scenarios, which is ubiquitous in industrial recommendation systems. These scenarios enjoy portions of overlaps in users and items, while the distribution of different scenarios is different. The key point of multi-scenario modeling is to efficiently maximize the use of whole-scenario information and granularly generate adaptive representations both for users and items among multiple scenarios. we  Cites: Don t stop pretraining: adapt language models to domains and tasks
