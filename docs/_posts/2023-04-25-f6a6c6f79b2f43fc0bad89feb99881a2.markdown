Scientific understanding is a fundamental goal of science, allowing us to explain the world. There is currently no good way to measure the scientific understanding of agents, whether these be humans or Artificial Intelligence systems. Without a clear benchmark, it is challenging to evaluate and compare different levels of and approaches to scientific understanding. In this Roadmap, we propose a framework to create a benchmark for scientific understanding, utilizing tools from philosophy of  Cites: Beyond the imitation game: Quantifying and extrapolating the
