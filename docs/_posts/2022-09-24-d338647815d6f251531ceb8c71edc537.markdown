The reinforcement learning (RL) research area is very active, with an important number of new contributions; especially considering the emergent field of deep RL (DRL). However a number of scientific and technical challenges still need to be resolved, amongst which we can mention the ability to abstract actions or the difficulty to explore the environment in sparse-reward settings which can be addressed by intrinsic motivation (IM). We propose to survey these research works Cites: Explore, discover and learn: Unsupervised discovery of state
