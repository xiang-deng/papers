Abstract Domain adaptation (DA) have achieved phased results in fault transfer diagnosis. However, there is still no unified framework that not only minimize geometrical shift but also minimize distribution shift of source and target data. Besides, existing DA approaches only exploit shared features between domains, which will degenerate when the two domains have a big shift, since a common subspace may not exist. In this paper, a novel joint distinct subspace learning and …
