A cross domain multistream classification is a challenging problem calling for fast domain adaptations to handle different but related streams in never-ending and rapidly changing environments. Notwithstanding that existing multistream classifiers assume no labeled samples in the target stream, they still incur expensive labeling costs since they require fully labeled samples of the source stream. This article aims to attack the problem of extreme label shortage in the cross domain multistream Cites: Understanding self-training for gradual domain adaptation
