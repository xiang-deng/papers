Pairwise re-ranking models predict which of two documents is more relevant to a query and then aggregate a final ranking from such preferences. This is often more effective than pointwise re-ranking models that directly predict a relevance value for each document. However, the high inference overhead of pairwise models limits their practical application: usually, for a set of $ k $ documents to be re-ranked, preferences for all $ k^ 2-k $ comparison pairs excluding self-comparisons are …
