As in many other research areas, the use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques is growing in software engineering. However, these techniques are not yet widespread in the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) field. In this paper, we explore the use of DL to extract useful text embeddings out of software models. We propose a novel approach to embedding software models by means of transformer architectures trained on large datasets. Our approach combines intermediate representations and Cites: Knowledge enhanced contextual word representations
