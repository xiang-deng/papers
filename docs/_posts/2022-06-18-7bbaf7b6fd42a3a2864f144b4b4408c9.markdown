Text preprocessing is not only an essential step to prepare the corpus for modeling but also a key area that directly affects the natural language processing (NLP) application results. For instance, precise tokenization increases the accuracy of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and retaining multiword expressions improves reasoning and machine translation. The text corpus needs to be appropriately preprocessed before it is ready to serve as the input to computer models. The preprocessing …
