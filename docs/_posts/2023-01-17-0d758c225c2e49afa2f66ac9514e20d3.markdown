Current neural network solutions in scientific document processing employ models pretrained on domain-specific corpi, which are usually limited in model size, as pretraining can be costly and limited by training resources. We introduce a framework that uses data augmentation from such domain-specific pretrained models to transfer domain specific knowledge to larger general pretrained models and improve performance on downstream tasks. Our method improves the …
