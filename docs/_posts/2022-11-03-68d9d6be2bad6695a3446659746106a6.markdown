Self-supervised models trained with a contrastive loss such as CLIP have shown to be very powerful in zero-shot classification settings. However, to be used as a zero-shot classifier these models require the user to provide new captions over a fixed set of labels at test time. In many settings, it is hard or impossible to know if a new query caption is compatible with the source captions used to train the model. We address these limitations by framing the zero-shot classification task as an outlier detection …
