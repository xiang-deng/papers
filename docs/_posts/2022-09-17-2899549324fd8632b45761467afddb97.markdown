Sparse document representations have been widely used to retrieve relevant documents via exact lexical matching. Owing to the pre-computed inverted index, it supports fast ad-hoc search but incurs the vocabulary mismatch problem. Although recent neural ranking models using pre-trained language models can address this problem, they usually require expensive query inference costs, implying the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. Tackling the trade-off, we propose a novel uni  Cites: Salient Phrase Aware Dense Retrieval: Can a Dense Retriever
