Legal judgment Prediction (LJP), aiming to predict a judgment based on fact descriptions, serves as legal assistance to mitigate the great work burden of limited legal practitioners. Most existing methods apply various large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) finetuned in LJP tasks to obtain consistent improvements. However, we discover the fact that the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model makes judgment predictions according to wrong (or non-casual) information, which not only weakens  Cites: Efficiently Summarizing Text and Graph Encodings of Multi
