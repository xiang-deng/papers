This paper suggests a strategy to obtain extractive long-form answers from Annual Reports. Perceiving most previous usage, BERT has been used to get short answers with either a phrase or a sentence. Annual reports are simply not sufficient and most queries require a more well-rounded answer. In this paper, TF-IDF, FinBERT, and BERT are used to build extractive long answers from annual reportswhich is a very large context. The BERT model that is used in the pipeline is pre-trained on  Cites: Model Agnostic Answer Reranking System for Adversarial
