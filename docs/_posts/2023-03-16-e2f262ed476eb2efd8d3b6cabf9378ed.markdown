Currently, with the rapid development of deep learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in various computer vision tasks. However, in the pursuit of performance, advanced DNN models have become more complex, which has led to a large memory footprint and high computation demands. As a result, the models are difficult to apply in real time. To address these issues, model compression has become a focus of research. Furthermore, model compression …
