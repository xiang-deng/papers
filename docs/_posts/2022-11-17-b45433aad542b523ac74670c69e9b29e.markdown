Abstract Native Language Identification is a prominent paralinguistic study with applications ranging from biometric analysis to speaker adaptation. Former studies on this task have benefited from alternative acoustic feature representations and pre-trained neural networks. In this work, we explore the Native Language Identification performance of contextual acoustic (wav2vec 2.0) and linguistic (BERT) embeddings as state-of-the-art feature representations and combine them with acoustic features  Cites: Algorithm selection and model adaptation for ESL correction tasks
