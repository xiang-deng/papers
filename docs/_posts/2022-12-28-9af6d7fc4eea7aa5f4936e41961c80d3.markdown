Machine reading comprehension (MRC) aims to train machines to comprehend a given context and then answer a series of questions according to their understanding of the context. It is the cornerstone of conversational reading comprehension and question answering tasks. Recently, researches of MRC have experienced considerable development with more and more semantic features being incorporated into end-to-end neural network models, such as pre-trained word Cites: Coqa: A conversational question answering challenge
