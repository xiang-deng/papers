How do generative linguistic knowledge and knowledge of item-specific usage preferences jointly contribute to language processing? We investigated this using the test case of binomial expression ordering preferences (eg bread and butter vs. butter and bread), which are driven both by a) generative constraints referencing phonological, semantic, or other lexical properties of the elements in a binomial, eg a short-beforelong constraint; and b) item-specific experience in which an order is Cites: Emergent linguistic structure in artificial neural networks trained by
