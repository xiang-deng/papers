Few-shot abstractive summarization has become a challenging task in natural language generation. To support it, we designed a novel soft prompts architecture coupled with a prompt pre-training plus fine-tuning paradigm that is effective and tunes only extremely light parameters. The soft prompts include continuous input embeddings across an encoder and a decoder to fit the structure of the generation models. Importantly, a novel inner-prompt placed in the text is introduced to capture Cites: Few-shot learning for opinion summarization
