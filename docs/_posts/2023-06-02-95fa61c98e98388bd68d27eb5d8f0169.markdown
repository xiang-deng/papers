Large language models (LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of natural language tasks from just a handful of in-context examples. However, for generating strings from highly structured languages (eg, semantic parsing to complex domain-specific languages), it is challenging for the LLM to generalize from just a few exemplars. We explore $\textbf {grammar prompting} $ as a simple approach for enabling LLMs to use external knowledge and domain-specific constraints  Cites: Toolformer: Language models can teach themselves to use tools
