An approach to improve question-answering performance is to retrieve accompanying information that contains factual evidence matching the question. These retrieved documents are then fed into a reader that generates an answer. A commonly applied retriever is dense passage retrieval. In this retriever, the output of a transformer neural network is used to query a knowledge database for matching documents. Inspired by the observation that different layers of a transformer network Cites: Break It Down: A Question Understanding Benchmark
