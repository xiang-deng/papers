Abstract Graph Neural Networks (GNN) show good performance in relational data classification. However, their contribution to concept learning and the validation of their output from an application domain s and user s perspective have not been thoroughly studied. We argue that combining symbolic learning methods, such as Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), with statistical machine learning methods, especially GNNs, is an essential forward-looking step to perform powerful and …
