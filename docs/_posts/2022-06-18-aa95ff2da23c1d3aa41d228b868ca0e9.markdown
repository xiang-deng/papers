Feature representations derived from models pre-trained on large-scale datasets have shown their generalizability on a variety of audio analysis tasks. Despite this generalizability, however, task-specific features can outperform if sufficient training data is available, as specific task-relevant properties can be learned. Furthermore, the complex pre-trained models bring considerable computational burdens during inference. We propose to leverage both detailed task-specific features from …
