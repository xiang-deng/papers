Contextually aware intelligent agents are often required to understand the users and their surroundings in real-time. Our goal is to build Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that can assist children in their learning process. Within such complex frameworks, Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) are crucial building blocks to handle efficient task- oriented communication with children in game-based learning settings. We are working towards a multimodal dialogue system for younger kids learning basic math Cites: Composed variational natural language generation for few-shot
