Abstract Knowledge graphs usually consist of billions of triplet facts describing the real world. Although most of the existing knowledge graphs are huge in scale, they are still far from completion. As a result, varieties of knowledge graph embedding approaches have emerged, which have been proven to be an effective and efficient solution for knowledge graph completion. In this paper, we devise a novel knowledge graph embedding model named InterERP, which aims to improve model Cites: Semantic parsing via staged query graph generation: Question
