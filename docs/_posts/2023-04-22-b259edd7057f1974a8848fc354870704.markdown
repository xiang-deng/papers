Robots can use auditory, visual, or haptic interfaces to convey information to human users. The way these interfaces select signals is typically pre-defined by the designer: for instance, a haptic wristband might vibrate when the robot is moving and squeeze when the robot stops. But different people interpret the same signals in different ways, so that what makes sense to one person might be confusing or unintuitive to another. In this paper we introduce a unified algorithmic formalism for …
