Scene text recognition (STR) is a task of identifying text from natural scene text images. Recently, based on the advantages of self-supervised contrastive learning, some studies incorporate contrastive learning strategies for STR task. However, these studies mainly focus on data argumentation of images from a visual perspective, ignoring the fact that scene text often contains large noise and has the characteristics of diversity. For addressing this issue, in this paper, we propose a text Cites: A framework for contrastive self-supervised learning and designing
