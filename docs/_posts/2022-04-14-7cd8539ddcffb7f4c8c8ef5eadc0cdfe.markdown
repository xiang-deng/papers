In the design of object detection algorithms, the label Assignment and positive/negative sample identification are very important, affecting the convergence speed and object detection performance. Nowadays, positive/negative sample identification mainly focuses on one-to-many label assignment of Ground-Truth and Bounding Box, and few researchers have paid attention to the label assignment of end-to-end object detection models. In this paper, aiming at end-to-end object Cites: Learning from noisy anchors for one-stage object detection
