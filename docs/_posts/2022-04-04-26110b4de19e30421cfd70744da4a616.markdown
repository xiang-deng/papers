We explore the plain, non-hierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT) as a backbone network for object detection. This design enables the original ViT architecture to be fine-tuned for object detection without needing to redesign a hierarchical backbone for pre-training. With minimal adaptations for fine-tuning, our plain-backbone detector can achieve competitive results. Surprisingly, we observe:(i) it is sufficient to build a simple feature pyramid from a single-scale feature map (without the common FPN Cites: Electra: Pre-training text encoders as discriminators rather than
