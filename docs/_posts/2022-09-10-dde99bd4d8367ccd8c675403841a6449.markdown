Most existing semi-supervised graph-based clustering methods exploit the supervisory information by either refining the affinity matrix or directly constraining the low-dimensional representations of data points. The affinity matrix represents the graph structure and is vital to the performance of semi-supervised graph-based clustering. However, existing methods adopt a static affinity matrix to learn the low-dimensional representations of data points and do not optimize the affinity matrix  Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
