Day ahead forecasting of residential load (DAFRL) plays a key role in power system. To facilitate precise DAFRL, a neural memory network-based forecasting model was proposed. Firstly, the residential users with similar electricity power consumption mode are to be classified via the K-Means clustering. Thereafter, load data is de-noised with wavelet. A Neural Memory Network (NMN) model is developed to perform combination forecasting of residential users in the end.
