Millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing has emerged as a promising technology for human activity recognition (HAR), providing enhanced privacy and non-invasive monitoring in healthcare applications. In this paper, we propose a robust deeplearning approach to HAR using mmWave sensing, focusing on improving performance and adaptability across various frequency bands and datasets. Our custom model incorporates ConvNeXt as the base model, with a final classification  Cites: Symbolic discovery of optimization algorithms
