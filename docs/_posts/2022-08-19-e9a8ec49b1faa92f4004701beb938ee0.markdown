eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a new trend of machine learning. Machine learning models are used to predict or decide something, and they derive output based on a large volume of data set. Here, the problem is that it is hard to know why such prediction was derived, especially when using deep learning models. It makes the models unreliable in the case of reliability-critical applications. So, it is required to explain how they derived such output. It is a reliability-critical application for self Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
