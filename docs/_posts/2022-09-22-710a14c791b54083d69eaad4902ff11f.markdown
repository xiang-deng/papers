Spam consists of unwanted messages that are often containers of malicious code and/or links pointing to shady sites or objects that pose real dangers to a company s machines, software, or data. Spam detection is therefore a primary security objective. Nevertheless, the detection tools available on the market are few in number and their efficiency is often limited. In this paper, we propose a spam detection tool based on deep-learning. Our tool uses bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory networks while  Cites: Glove: Global vectors for word representation
