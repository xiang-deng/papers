Recently, semantic parsing using hierarchical representations for dialog systems has captured substantial attention. Task-Oriented Parse (TOP), a tree representation with intents and slots as labels of nested tree nodes, has been proposed for parsing user utterances. Previous TOP parsing methods are limited on tackling unseen dynamic slot values (eg, new songs and locations added), which is an urgent matter for real dialog systems. To mitigate this issue, we first propose a novel span-splitting  Cites: Span-based semantic parsing for compositional generalization
