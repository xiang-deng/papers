Abstract Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) has recently received a lot of attention and many innovative methods have been proposed in this area, but few have been developed for temporal KGQA. Most of the existing temporal KGQA methods focus on semantic or temporal level matching and lack the ability to reason about time constraints. In this paper we propose a subgraph-based model for answering complex questions over temporal knowledge graphs (TKG), inspired by … Cites: ‪Semantic parsing on freebase from question-answer pairs‬
