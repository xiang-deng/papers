In the era of information explosion, named entity recognition (NER) has attracted widespread attention in the field of natural language processing, as it is fundamental to information extraction. Recently, methods of NER based on representation learning, eg, character embedding and word embedding, have demonstrated promising recognition results. However, existing models only consider partial features derived from words or characters while failing to integrate semantic and  Cites: Multi-task identification of entities, relations, and coreference for
