Most metal–organic frameworks are composed of a single organic linker bridging between two different metal clusters. On the other hand,“double-linker” MOFs, which can be formed by bridging two different metal clusters with two organic ligands, are comparatively rare. In this work, we devise an algorithm that can computationally generate these double-linker MOFs and use our strategy to build a large database of hypothetical double-linker MOFs. These MOFs tend to have large pore volumes …
