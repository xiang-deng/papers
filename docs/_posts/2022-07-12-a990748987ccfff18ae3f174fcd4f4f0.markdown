Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been widely applied in recommendations. One reason is that their amortized inferences are beneficial for overcoming the data sparsity. However, in explainable recommendation that generates natural language explanations, they are still rarely explored. Thus, we aim to extend VAE to explainable recommendation. In this task, we find that VAE can generate acceptable explanations for users with few relevant training samples, however, it tends to  Cites: Plug and play autoencoders for conditional text generation
