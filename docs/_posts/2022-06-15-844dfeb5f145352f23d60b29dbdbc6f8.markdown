We consider the problem of extracting a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from a trained recurrent neural network (RNN). We present a novel algorithm that uses exact learning and abstract interpretation to perform efficient extraction of a minimal DFA describing the state dynamics of a given RNN. We use Angluin s\(\hbox {L}^{*}\) algorithm as a learner and the given RNN as an oracle, refining the abstraction of the RNN only as much as necessary for answering equivalence queries. Our technique …
