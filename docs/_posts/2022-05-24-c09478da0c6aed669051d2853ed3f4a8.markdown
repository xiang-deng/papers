Lacking disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) for knee osteoarthritis (KOA), Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is often considered an important clinical outcome. Thus, it is important to determine the most relevant factors that are associated with the risk of TKA. The present study aims to develop a model based on a combination of X-ray trabecular bone texture (TBT) analysis, and clinical and radiological information to predict TKA risk in patients with or at risk of developing … Cites: ‪Prediction of total knee replacement and diagnosis of osteoarthritis …‬
