Multi-source Domain Generalization (DG) measures a classifier s ability to generalize to new distributions of data it was not trained on, given several training domains. While several multi-source DG methods have been proposed, they incur additional complexity during training by using domain labels. Recent work has shown that a well-tuned Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) training procedure, that is simply minimizing the empirical risk on the source domains, can outperform most existing …
