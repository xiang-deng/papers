Process monitoring is important for ensuring operational reliability and preventing occupational accidents. In recent years, data-driven methods such as machine learning and deep learning have been preferred for fault detection and diagnosis. In particular, unsupervised learning algorithms, such as auto-encoders, exhibit good detection performance, even for unlabeled data from complex processes. However, decisions generated from deep-neural-network-based models are difficult to interpret  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
