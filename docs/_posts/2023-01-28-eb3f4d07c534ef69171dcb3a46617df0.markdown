In the field of Automated Planning there is often the need for a set of planning problems from a particular domain, eg, to be used as training data for Machine Learning or as benchmarks in planning competitions. In most cases, these problems are created either by hand or by a domain-specific generator, putting a burden on the human designers. In this paper we propose NeSIG, to the best of our knowledge the first domain-independent method for automatically generating planning problems …
