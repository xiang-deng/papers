Normalization is a vital process for any machine learning task as it controls the properties of data and affects model performance at large. The impact of particular forms of normalization, however, has so far been investigated in limited domain-specific classification tasks and not in a general fashion. Motivated by the lack of such a comprehensive study, in this paper we investigate the performance of lp-constrained softmax loss classifiers across different norm orders, magnitudes, and Cites: Spherical latent spaces for stable variational autoencoders
