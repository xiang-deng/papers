Recently, structured computing has become an interesting topic in the world of artificial intelligence, especially in the field of machine learning, as most researchers focus on the development of graph-based semi-supervised learning models. In this paper, we present a new framework for graph-based semi-supervised learning. We present a powerful method for simultaneous label inference and linear transform estimation. The targeted linear transformation is used to obtain a discriminant …
