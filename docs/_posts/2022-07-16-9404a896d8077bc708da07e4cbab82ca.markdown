Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is an effective framework to model the interdependency for non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT). One of the prominent VAE-based NAT frameworks, LaNMT, achieves great improvements to vanilla models, but still suffers from two main issues which lower down the translation quality:(1) mismatch between training and inference circumstances and (2) inadequacy of latent representations. In this work, we target on addressing these  Cites: Latent-variable non-autoregressive neural machine translation
