Hyperbolic networks have shown prominent improvements over their Euclidean counterparts in several areas involving hierarchical datasets in various domains such as computer vision, graph analysis, and natural language processing. However, their adoption in practice remains restricted due to (i) non-scalability on accelerated deep learning hardware,(ii) vanishing gradients due to the closure of hyperbolic space, and (iii) information loss due to frequent mapping between local  Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
