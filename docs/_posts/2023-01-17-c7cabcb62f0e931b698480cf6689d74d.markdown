With the widespread use of smart contracts in various fields, the research on smart contract vulnerability detection has increased yearly. Most of the previous research work is based on symbol detection and comparison with expert-defined error patterns to analyze the possible vulnerabilities of smart contracts. The accuracy and performance of such methods are generally low. In response to this problem, this paper proposes an efficient smart contract vulnerability detection model VDDL  Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
