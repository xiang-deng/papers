Humans are known to favor other individuals who exist in similar groups as them, exhibiting biased behavior, which is termed it as in-group bias. The groups could be formed on the basis of ethnicity, age, or even a favorite sports team. Taking cues from this behavior, we inspect if deep learning networks also mimic this human behavior, and are affected by in-group and outgroup biases. In this research, the behavior of face recognition models is evaluated to understand if similar to humans, models also Cites: Deep weighted averaging classifiers
