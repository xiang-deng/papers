Meta-learning is critical for a variety of practical ML systems--like personalized recommendations systems--that are required to generalize to new tasks despite a small number of task-specific training points. Existing meta-learning techniques use two complementary approaches of either learning a low-dimensional representation of points for all tasks, or task-specific fine-tuning of a global model trained using all the tasks. In this work, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that combines Cites: Pre-train, prompt, and predict: A systematic survey of prompting
