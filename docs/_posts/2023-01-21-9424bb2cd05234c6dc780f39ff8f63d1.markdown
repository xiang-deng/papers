Industry practitioners always face the problem of choosing the appropriate model for deployment under different considerations, such as to maximize a metric that is crucial for production, or to reduce the total cost given financial concerns. In this work, we focus on the text classification task and present a quantitative analysis for this challenge. Using classification accuracy as the main metric, we evaluate the classifiers performances for a variety of models, including large language models  Cites: Green AI
