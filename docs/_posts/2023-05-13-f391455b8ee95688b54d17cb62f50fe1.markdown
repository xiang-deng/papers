In recent research, problems with biased datasets or domain shift have presented challenges to the practical applications of deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose a simple method using adversarial learning combined with contrastive learning and domain adaptation to solve the domain-shift problem. Because domain shift is caused by differences in the distribution of data across domains, different approaches have been proposed to resolve this by rendering the data distributions  Cites: Connect, not collapse: Explaining contrastive learning for
