Speaker diarization is a key component of systems that support multiparty interactions of co-located users, such as meeting facilitation robots. The goal is to identify who spoke what, often to provide feedback, moderate participation, and personalize responses by the robot. Current systems use a combination of acoustic (eg pitch differences) and visual features (eg gaze) to perform diarization, but involve the use of additional sensors or require overhead signal processing efforts  Cites: Experience grounds language
