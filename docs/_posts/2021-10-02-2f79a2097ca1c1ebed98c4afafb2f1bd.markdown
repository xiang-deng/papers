Textual Question Answering (QA) aims to provide precise answers to user s questions in natural language using unstructured data. One of the most popular approaches to this goal is machine reading comprehension (MRC). In recent years, many novel datasets and evaluation metrics based on classical MRC tasks have been proposed for broader textual QA tasks. In this paper, we survey 47 recent textual QA benchmark datasets and propose a new taxonomy from an application Cites: Latent retrieval for weakly supervised open domain question
