Breast tumors are from the common infections among women around the world. Classifying the various types of breast tumors contribute to treating breast tumors more efficiently. However, this classification task is often hindered by dense tissue patterns captured in mammograms. The present study has been proposed a dense tissue pattern characterization framework using deep neural network. A total of 322 mammograms belonging to the mini-MIAS dataset and 4880 mammograms from Cites: Breast density classification with deep convolutional neural networks
