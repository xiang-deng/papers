We propose a new paradigm for universal information extraction (IE) that is compatible with any schema format and applicable to a list of IE tasks, such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, event extraction and sentiment analysis. Our approach converts the text-based IE tasks as the token-pair problem, which uniformly disassembles all extraction targets into joint span detection, classification and association problems with a unified extractive framework, namely UniEX.
