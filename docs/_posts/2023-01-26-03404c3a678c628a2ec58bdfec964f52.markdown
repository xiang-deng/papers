Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is an NLP task that classify fine-grained sentiment towards one specific aspect from the same text. While attention mechanism has achieved great success, attaching aspects to abstract sentiment remains challenging. In this paper, we propose dual attention mechanism, a novel method to re-weight the distribution of attention between stack BERT layers, in prompt learning way with pretrained language model BERT. Specifically, after …
