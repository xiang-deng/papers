To prevent people from contracting COVID-19 and mitigate its spread, it is crucial to timely distribute complete, accurate, and up-to- date information about the pandemic to the public. In this article, we propose a spatial-temporally bursty-aware method called STBA for real-time detection of COVID- 19 events from Twitter. STBA has three consecutive stages. In the first stage, STBA Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
