Smart grid system can obtain users  daily load data, and by clustering, we can get users  load profiles to divide them into industrial, commercial and residential types. Load data has the characteristic of changing periodically. Within a period, the load profiles are relatively stable. However, load profiles often changes significantly according to reasons like holidays and season changing. When conducting a continuous clustering task for consecutive days, traditional clustering algorithms …
