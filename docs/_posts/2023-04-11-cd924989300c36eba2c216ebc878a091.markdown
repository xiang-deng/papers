Ontology matching is crucial to data integration for across-silo data sharing and has been mainly addressed with heuristic and machine learning (ML) methods. While heuristic methods are often inflexible and hard to extend to new domains, ML methods rely on substantial and hard to obtain amounts of labeled training data. To overcome these limitations, we propose VersaMatch, a flexible, weakly-supervised ontology matching system. VersaMatch employs various weak supervision sources  Cites: On the importance of adaptive data collection for extremely
