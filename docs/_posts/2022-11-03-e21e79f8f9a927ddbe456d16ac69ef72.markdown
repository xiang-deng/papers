We show that uncertainty sampling is sufficient to achieve exploration versus exploitation in graph-based active learning, as long as the measure of uncertainty properly aligns with the underlying model and the model properly reflects uncertainty in unexplored regions. In particular, we use a recently developed algorithm, Poisson ReWeighted Laplace Learning (PWLL) for the classifier and we introduce an acquisition function designed to measure uncertainty in this graph-based classifier …
