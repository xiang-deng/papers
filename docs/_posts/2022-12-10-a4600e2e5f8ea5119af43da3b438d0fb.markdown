Recent self-supervised models have demonstrated equal or better performance than supervised methods, opening for AI systems to learn visual representations from practically unlimited data. However, these methods are typically classification-based and thus ineffective for learning high-resolution feature maps that preserve precise spatial information. This work introduces superpixels to improve self-supervised learning of dense semantically rich visual concept embeddings. Decomposing …
