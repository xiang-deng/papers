Accessing longer-wavelength photons is a critical research direction in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Currently, dye-sensitized solar cells are exceptional at generating high photovoltages with shorter wavelength photons, but few examples exist of DSSCs using photons in the shortwave infrared region (> 1000 nm). New dye building blocks are critical toward accessing these longer-wavelength photons. With this in mind, five new triphenylamine-based metal-free dyes derived from a donor Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
