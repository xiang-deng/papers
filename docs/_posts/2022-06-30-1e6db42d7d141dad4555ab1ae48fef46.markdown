Automotive industry has witnessed expensive, dangerous, and potentially fatal recalls over the years. With the rollout of new electric vehicles (EV), additional complexity is brought into the manufacturing process. Companies must use expensive fault detection systems to identify defects in the assembly process. Knowledge-based approaches for fault detection in manufacturing and assembly systems reflect modern practices in Industry 4.0. In this thesis, we examine the …
