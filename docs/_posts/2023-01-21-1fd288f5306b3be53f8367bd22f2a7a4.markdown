In recent years, the recommendation field has gradually started to combine GNN-like approaches to address the challenges. The Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF) framework has made a preliminary attempt to extract structural knowledge in model-based collaborative filtering based on graph convolution with message passing mechanisms, opening up new research possibilities. However, the NGCF framework does not consider the semantic information in the topology and only Cites: Learning question classifiers: the role of semantic information
