Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods have gained enormous attention from a wide range of AI communities including Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text generation, classification and context induction. Embedding a huge number of inter-relationships in terms of a small number of dimensions, require proper modeling in both cognitive and computational aspects. Recently, numerous objective functions regarding cognitive and computational aspects of natural languages are Cites: Modeling large-scale structured relationships with shared memory
