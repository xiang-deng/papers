Conditional graph generation tasks involve training a model to generate a graph given a set of input conditions. Many previous studies employ autoregressive models to incrementally generate graph components such as nodes and edges. However, as graphs typically lack a natural ordering among their components, converting a graph into a sequence of tokens is not straightforward. While prior works mostly rely on conventional heuristics or graph traversal methods like breadth-first search (BFS) or …
