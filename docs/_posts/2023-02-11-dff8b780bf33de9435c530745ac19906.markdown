Pre-trained language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 can carry fluent, multi-turn conversations out-of-the-box, making them attractive materials for chatbot design. Further, designers can improve LLM chatbot utterances by prepending textual prompts--instructions and examples of desired interactions--to its inputs. However, prompt-based improvements can be brittle; designers face challenges systematically understanding how a prompt strategy might impact the unfolding of subsequent …
