Insecure coding practices are a known, long-standing problem in open-source development, which takes on a new dimension with the current capabilities for mining open-source software repositories through version control systems. Although most insecure practices require a sequence of interlinked behaviour, prior work also determined that simpler, one-liner coding practices can introduce vulnerabilities in the code. Such simple stupid insecure practices (SSIPs) can have severe security Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
