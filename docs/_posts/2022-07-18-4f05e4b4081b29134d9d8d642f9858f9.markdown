Current information retrieval systems are more concerned with helping users look up the information they want, but retrieving it accurately is a difficult task. In this paper, we proposed a Q&A Information Retrieval system for computer textbooks based on the Pattern Matching method, called the PM-IR system, which achieves accurate retrieval of textbook information and intelligent Q&A. Firstly, the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency-Inverse Head Frequency algorithm (TF-IDF-IHF) is Cites: Koko: A system for scalable semantic querying of text
