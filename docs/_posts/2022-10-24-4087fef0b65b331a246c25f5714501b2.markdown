Model-based and learning-based methods are two major types of methodologies to model car following behaviors. Model-based methods describe the car-following behaviors with explicit mathematical equations, while learning-based methods focus on getting a mapping between inputs and outputs. Both types of methods have advantages and weaknesses. Meanwhile, most car-following models are generative and only consider the inputs of the speed, position, and acceleration of the last time  Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
