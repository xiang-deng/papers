Dialog systems must be capable of incorporating new skills via updates over time in order to reflect new use cases or deployment scenarios. Similarly, developers of such ML-driven systems need to be able to add new training data to an already- existing dataset to support these new skills. In intent classification systems, problems can arise if training data for a new skill s intent overlaps semantically with an already- existing intent. We call such cases collisions. This paper introduces the task of intent Cites: Mobilebert: a compact task-agnostic bert for resource-limited devices
