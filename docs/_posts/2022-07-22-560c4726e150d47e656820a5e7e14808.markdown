Abstract Document-level Relation Extraction (Doc-level RE) aims to extract relations among entities from a document, which requires reasoning over multiple sentences. The pronouns are ubiquitous in the document, which can provide reasoning clues for Doc-level RE. However, previous works do not take the pronouns into account.
