Dialogue-based Relation Extraction (DRE) aims to predict the relation type of argument pairs that are mentioned in dialogue. The latest trigger-enhanced methods propose trigger prediction tasks to promote DRE. However, these methods are not able to fully leverage the trigger information and even bring noise to relation extraction. To solve these problems, we propose TLAG, which fully leverages the trigger and label-aware knowledge to guide the relation extraction. First, we design  Cites: Learning recurrent span representations for extractive question
