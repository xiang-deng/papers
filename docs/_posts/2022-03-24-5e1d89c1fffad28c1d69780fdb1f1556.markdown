Methane is one of the most dangerous gases encountered in the mining industry. During mining operations, methane can be broadly classified into three states: mining excavation, stoppage safety check, and abnormal methane concentration, which is usually a precursor to a gas accident, such as a coal and gas outburst. Consequently, it is vital to accurately predict methane concentrations. Herein, we apply three deep learning methodsa recurrent neural network (RNN), long short Cites: Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder
