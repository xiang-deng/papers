The abuse of DeepFake technique has raised enormous public concerns in recent years. Currently, the existing DeepFake datasets suffer some weaknesses of obvious visual artifacts, minimal Asian proportion, backward synthesis methods and short video length. To make up these weaknesses, we have constructed an Asian large-scale challenging DeepFake dataset to enable the training of DeepFake detection models and organized the accompanying video track of the first Fake Media …
