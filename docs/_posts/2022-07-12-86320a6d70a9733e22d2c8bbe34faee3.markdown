Recently, functional brain network analysis via graph neural networks has achieved state-of-the-art results as it can directly extract information from irregular graphs without any approximation. However, current methods remain limited in exploring the high-order structural information of brain networks. To address this issue, we propose a hypergraph attention network for functional brain network classification (FC-HAT). First, we build a dynamic hypergraph generation phase and model each  Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
