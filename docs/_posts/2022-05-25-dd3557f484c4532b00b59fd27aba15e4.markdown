Results. The maximum accuracy achieved during training of the mathematical model of the convolutional neural network for classification into 5 classes (absence of diabetic retinopathy signs and 4 stages in presence of such signs) was only 57.4%[56.9; 57.9]. Training of the mathematical model of the convolutional neural network for binary classification (presence of retinopathy at any stage or its absence) lead to 80.7% accuracy [79.9; 81.2] in recognition of diabetic retinopathy on digital … Cites: ‪Deep learning-enabled medical computer vision‬
