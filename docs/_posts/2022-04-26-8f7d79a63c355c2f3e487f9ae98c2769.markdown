Code comment generation is the task of generating a high-level natural language description for a given code method or function. Although researchers have been studying multiple ways to generate code comments automatically, previous work mainly considers representing a code token in its entirety semantics form only (eg, a language model is used to learn the semantics of a code token), and additional code properties such as the tree structure of a code are included as an auxiliary input to Cites: Learning to represent edits
