Abstract Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict the missing element in a triple based on known triples or facts. Recently, plenty of representation learning methods for KGC have achieved the promising performance, especially ones based on graph neural networks and their variants. Those methods exploit local neighborhood information to update the embedding of target entities. However, the existing works have the following two problems. First, those approaches focus on the …
