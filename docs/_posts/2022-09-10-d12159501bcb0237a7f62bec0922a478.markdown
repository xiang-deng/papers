Controllable text generation has taken a gigantic step forward these days. Yet existing methods are either constrained in a one-off pattern or not efficient enough for receiving multiple conditions at every generation stage. We propose a model-agnostic framework Plug-in Conditional Auto-Encoder for Controllable Text Generation (PCAE) towards flexible and semi-supervised text generation. Our framework is plug-and-play with partial parameters to be fine-tuned in the pre Cites: Gedi: Generative discriminator guided sequence generation
