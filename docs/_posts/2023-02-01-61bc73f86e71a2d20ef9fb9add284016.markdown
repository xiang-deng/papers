The lack of large amounts of labeled data is a significant factor blocking many low-resource languages and domains from catching up with recent advancements in natural language processing. To reduce this dependency on labeled instances, weak supervision (semi-) automatically annotates unlabeled data. These labels can be obtained more quickly and cheaply than manual, gold-standard annotations. They also, however, contain more errors. Handling these noisy labels is often required to …
