The topic of comprehensibility of machine-learned theories has recently drawn increasing attention. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) uses logic programming to derive logic theories from small data based on abduction and induction techniques. Learned theories are represented in the form of rules as declarative descriptions of obtained knowledge. In earlier work, the authors provided the first evidence of a measurable increase in human comprehension based on machine-learned logic … Cites: ‪Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations‬
