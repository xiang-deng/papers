This paper studies the problem of injecting factual knowledge into large pre-trained language models. We train adapter modules on parts of the ConceptNet knowledge graph using the masked language modeling objective and evaluate the success of the method by a series of probing experiments on the LAMA probe. Mean P@ K curves for different configurations indicate that the technique is effective, increasing the performance on subsets of the LAMA probe for large values of k by adding as …
