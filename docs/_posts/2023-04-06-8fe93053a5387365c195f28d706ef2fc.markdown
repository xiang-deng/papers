In this thesis, we first study the two ill-posed natural language processing tasks related to stock prediction, ie stock movement prediction and financial document-level event extraction. While implementing stock prediction and event extraction, we encountered difficulties that could be resolved by utilizing out-of-distribution detection. Consequently, we presented a new approach for out-of-distribution detection, which is the third focus of this thesis. First, we systematically build a …
