In this work, we build recent advances in distributional reinforcement learning to give a state-of-art distributional variant of the model based on the IQN. We achieve this by using the GAN model s generator and discriminator function with the quantile regression to approximate the full quantile value for the state-action return distribution. We demonstrate improved performance on our baseline dataset-57 Atari 2600 games in the ALE. Also, we use our algorithm to show the state-of-art training
