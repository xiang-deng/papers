Recommender systems are able to learn user preferences based on user and item representations via their historical behaviors. To improve representation learning, recent recommendation models start leveraging information from various behavior types exhibited by users. In real-world scenarios, the user behavioral graph is not only multiplex but also dynamic, ie, the graph evolves rapidly over time, with various types of nodes and edges added or deleted, which causes the Neighborhood  Cites: Cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction with graph lstms
