Background. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common degenerative joint disease. In this study, we aimed to identify new biomarkers of KOA to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment. Methods. GSE98918 and GSE51588 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database as training sets, with a total of 74 samples. Gene differences were analyzed by Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, and Disease Ontology enrichment analyses for the …
