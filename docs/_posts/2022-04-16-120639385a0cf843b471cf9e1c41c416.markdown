Machine reading comprehension (MRC) is a crucial and challenging task in natural language processing (NLP). With the development of deep learning, language models have achieved excellent results. However, these models still cannot answer complex questions. Currently, researchers often utilize structured knowledge, such as knowledge bases (KBs), as external knowledge by directly extracting triples to enhance the results of machine reading. Although they can support certain Cites: Improving question answering by commonsense-based pre-training
