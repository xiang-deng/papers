AI virtual assistants are steadily expanding their way into multiple domains such as healthcare, hospitality, and telecommunication. However, such virtual assistants still suffer from a limited level of distinctive characteristics of domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we improve the Named Entity Recognition (NER) ability by facilitating (i) the assistants understanding of both general and domain-specific terms by building new datasets in the automotive domain and using adversarial training and  Cites: Electra: Pre-training text encoders as discriminators rather than
