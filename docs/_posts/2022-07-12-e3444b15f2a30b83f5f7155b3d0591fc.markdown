ABSTRACT BERT-based rankers have been shown very effective as rerankers in information retrieval tasks. In order to extend these models to full-ranking scenarios, the ColBERT model has been recently proposed, which adopts a late interaction mechanism. This mechanism allows for the representation of documents to be precomputed in advance. However, the late-interaction mechanism leads to large index size, as one needs to save a representation for each token of every document …
