Deep neural networks (DNNs) are machine learning algorithms that have revolutionized computer vision due to their remarkable successes in tasks like object classification and segmentation. The success of DNNs as computer vision algorithms has led to the suggestion that DNNs may also be good models of human visual perception. In this article, we review evidence regarding current DNNs as adequate behavioral models of human core object recognition. To this end, we argue that it is Cites: Wilds: A benchmark of in-the-wild distribution shifts
