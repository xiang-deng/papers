Organic neuromorphic device networks can accelerate neural network algorithms and directly integrate with microfluidic systems or living tissues. Proposed devices based on the bio-compatible conductive polymer PEDOT: PSS have shown high switching speeds and low energy demand. However, as electrochemical systems, they are prone to self-discharge through parasitic electrochemical reactions. Therefore, the network s synapses forget their trained conductance states over time  Cites: Lamda: Language models for dialog applications
