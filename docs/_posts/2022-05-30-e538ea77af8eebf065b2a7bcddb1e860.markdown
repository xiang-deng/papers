While a broad range of techniques have been proposed to tackle distribution shift, the simple baseline of training on an $\textit {undersampled} $ dataset often achieves close to state-of-the-art-accuracy across several popular benchmarks. This is rather surprising, since undersampling algorithms discard excess majority group data. To understand this phenomenon, we ask if learning is fundamentally constrained by a lack of minority group samples. We prove that this is indeed the case in the setting of  Cites: Just train twice: Improving group robustness without training group
