Distributed machine learning is primarily motivated by the promise of increased computation power for accelerating training and mitigating privacy concerns. Unlike machine learning on a single device, distributed machine learning requires collaboration and communication among the devices. This creates several new challenges:(1) the heavy communication overhead can be a bottleneck that slows down the training, and (2) the unreliable communication and weaker control over the …
