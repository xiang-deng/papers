Neural Machine Translation (NMT) heavily depends on the context vectors generated via attention network for the target word prediction. Existing works primarily focus on generating context vectors from words or subwords of sentences, limiting NMT models  ability to learn sufficient information about the source sentence representations. These situations are even worse when languages belong to extremely low-resource categories due to rare word problem. To improve the …
