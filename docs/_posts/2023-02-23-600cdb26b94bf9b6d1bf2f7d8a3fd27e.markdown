Semantic segmentation is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision. However, in many applications, a frequent obstacle is the lack of labeled images, due to the high cost of pixel-level labeling. In this scenario, it makes sense to approach the problem from a semi-supervised point of view, where both labeled and unlabeled images are exploited. In recent years this line of research has gained much interest and many approaches have been published in this direction …
