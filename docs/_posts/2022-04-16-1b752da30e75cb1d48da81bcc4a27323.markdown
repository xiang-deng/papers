Semi-supervised learning is the problem of finding clusters in a graph or a point- clould dataset where we are given few initial input labels. Label Spreading (LS) is a standard technique for this problem, which can be interpreted as a random walk diffusion process of the labels on the graph [1]. Recent work in network science has shown that in many graph algorithms a great advantage can be obtained when accounting directly for higher-order interactions modeled as hypergraphs, where, for Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
