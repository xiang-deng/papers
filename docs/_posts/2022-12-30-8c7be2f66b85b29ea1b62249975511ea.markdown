Local additive explanation methods are increasingly used to understand the predictions of complex Machine Learning (ML) models. The most used additive methods, SHAP and LIME, suffer from limitations that are rarely measured in the literature. This paper aims to measure these limitations on a wide range (304) of OpenML datasets using six quantitative metrics, and also evaluate emergent coalitional-based methods to tackle the weaknesses of other methods. We illustrate Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
