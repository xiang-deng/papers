We contribute OpeNTF, an open-source python-based benchmark library to support neural team formation research. Team formation falls under social information retrieval (Social IR), where the right group of experts should be retrieved to solve a task, which is intractable due to the vast pool of feasible candidates with diverse skills. Even though neural networks could successfully address efficiency while maintaining efficacy, they lack standard implementation and experimental details  Cites: OpenMatch: An Open Source Library for Neu-IR Research
