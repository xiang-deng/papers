Link prediction in knowledge hypergraphs is essential for various knowledge-based applications, including question answering and recommendation systems. However, many current approaches simply extend binary relation methods from knowledge graphs to n-ary relations, which does not allow for capturing entity positional and role information in n-ary tuples. To address this issue, we introduce PosKHG, a method that considers entities  positions and roles within n-ary tuples. PosKHG uses an …
