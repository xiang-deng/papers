Existing fully supervised event extraction models achieve advanced performance with large-scale labeled data. However, when new event types emerge and annotations are scarce, it is hard for the supervised models to master the new types with limited annotations. In contrast, humans can learn to understand new event types with only a few examples in the event extraction guideline. In this paper, we work on a challenging yet more realistic setting, the few-example event extraction. It  Cites: CLEVE: Contrastive Pre-training for Event Extraction
