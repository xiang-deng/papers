Forest maps are essential to understand forest dynamics. Due to the increasing availability of remote sensing data and machine learning models like convolutional neural networks, forest maps can these days be created on large scales with high accuracy. Common methods usually predict a map from remote sensing images without deliberately considering intermediate semantic concepts that are relevant to the final map. This makes the mapping process difficult to interpret, especially when Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
