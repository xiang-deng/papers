Recent years have witnessed the co-evolution of deep neural network (DNN) algorithms and the underlying hardware and software design. Despite that system researchers proposed a variety of optimization techniques to improve DNN training efficiency, most techniques are under-utilized in practice. The software/hardware deployments that ML programmers use in practice are widely diverse. Differences in algorithms, hardware features, or even software versions could all shift the  Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
