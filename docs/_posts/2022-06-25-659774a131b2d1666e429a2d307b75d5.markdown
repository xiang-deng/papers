Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) has become a widespread paradigm, making even the most complex machine learning models available for clients via eg a pay-per-query principle. This allows users to avoid time-consuming processes of data collection, hyperparameter tuning, and model training. However, by giving their customers access to the (predictions of their) models, MLaaS providers endanger their intellectual property, such as sensitive training data, optimised
