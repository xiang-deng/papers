BACKGROUND Postoperative delirium is a highly relevant complication of cardiac surgery. It is associated with worse outcomes and considerably increased costs of care. A novel approach of monitoring patients with machine learning enabled prediction software could trigger pre-emptive implementation of mitigation strategies as well as timely intervention. OBJECTIVE This study evaluates the predictive accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) model for anticipating postoperative delirium Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
