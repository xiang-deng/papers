One step in many automated fact-checking pipelines is verified claim retrieval, ie checking whether a claim has been fact-checked before. We approach this task as a semantic textual similarity problem. For this, we examine the extent to which an input claim and a verified claim are similar at semantic, textual, lexical and referential levels using a variety of NLP tools. We rank similar pairs based on these features using a supervised and an unsupervised model. We participate in two subtasks and Cites: SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings
