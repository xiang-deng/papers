Probabilistic seismic demand analysis (PSDA) is the most time-and effort-intensive step in risk-based assessment of the built environment. A typical PSDA requires subjecting the structure to a large number of ground motions and performing nonlinear dynamic analysis, where the analysis dimension and effort substantially increase at large-scale assessments such as community-level evaluations. This study presents a deep learning framework to estimate seismic demand models from …
