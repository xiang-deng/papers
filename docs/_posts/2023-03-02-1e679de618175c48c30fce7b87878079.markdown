Monitoring sustainable development goals requires accurate and timely socioeconomic statistics, while ubiquitous and frequently-updated urban imagery in web like satellite/street view images has emerged as an important source for socioeconomic prediction. Especially, recent studies turn to self-supervised contrastive learning with manually designed similarity metrics for urban imagery representation learning and further socioeconomic prediction, which however suffers …
