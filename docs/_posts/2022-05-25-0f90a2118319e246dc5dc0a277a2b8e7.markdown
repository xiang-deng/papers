This study presents a novel Quaternion-based link prediction method to be used in different recommendation systems. The method performs Quaternion algebra-based computations while making use of expressive and wide-ranged learning properties of the Hamilton products. The proposed key capabilities rely on link prediction to boost performance in top-N recommendation tasks. According to the achieved experimental results, the proposed method allows for highly improved performance Cites: Complex embeddings for simple link prediction
