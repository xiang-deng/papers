The adoption of deep learning models has brought significant performance improvements across several research fields, such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, their black-box nature yields the downside of poor explainability: in particular, several real-world applications requireto varying extentsreliable confidence scores associated to a model s prediction. The relation between a model s accuracy and confidence is typically referred to as calibration. In this work Cites: Calibration of Pre-trained Transformers
