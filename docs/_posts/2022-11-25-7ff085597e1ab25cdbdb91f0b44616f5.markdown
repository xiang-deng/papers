Modern natural language generation paradigms require a good decoding strategy to obtain quality sequences out of the model. Beam search yields high-quality but low diversity outputs; stochastic approaches suffer from high variance and sometimes low quality, but the outputs tend to be more natural and creative. In this work, we propose a deterministic search algorithm balancing both quality and diversity. We first investigate the vanilla best-first search (BFS) algorithm and then propose the  Cites: Quoref: A Reading Comprehension Dataset with Questions
