Despite its continuous growth, probabilistic programming is still a great unknown among scientists, specially those whose research areas involve sampling dis-tributions, statistical modeling or statistical inference. This Master Thesis provides, on one hand, a novel procedure to learn and construct probabilistic programs that serve to model and sample probabilistic distributions. These probabilistic programs are based on grammatical rules through the potential given by evolutionary algorithms …
