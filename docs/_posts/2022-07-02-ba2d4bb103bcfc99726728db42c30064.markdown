Deep neural networks have become the state-of-the-art tool to solve many computer vision problems. However, these algorithms face a lot of computational and optimization challenges. For example, a) the training of deep networks is not only computationally intensive but also requires a lot of manual effort and parameter turning, b) for some particular use-cases, such as adversarial deep networks, it s even challenging to optimize to achieve good or stable performance. In this
