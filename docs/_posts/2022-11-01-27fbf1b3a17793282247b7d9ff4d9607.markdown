Application of computational methods in engineering and science constantly increases, which is also visible in sector of material science, often with promising results. In following paper, authors would like to propose fractal dimension, a mathematical method of quantifying self-similarity and complexity of spatial patterns, as robust method of hardness estimation of low carbon steels. A dataset of microstructure images and corresponding Vickers hardness measurements of …
