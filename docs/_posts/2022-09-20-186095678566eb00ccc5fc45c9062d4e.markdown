Two of the most fundamental challenges in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) at present are:(a) how to establish whether deep learning-based models score highly on NLU benchmarks for the right reasons; and (b) to understand what those reasons would even be. We investigate the behavior of reading comprehension models with respect to two linguistic skills : coreference resolution and comparison. We propose a definition for the reasoning steps expected from a system that would be reading Cites: Coreference Reasoning in Machine Reading Comprehension
