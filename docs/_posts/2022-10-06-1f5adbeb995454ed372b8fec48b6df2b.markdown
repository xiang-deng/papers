In recent years, prompt tuning has set off a research boom in the adaptation of pre-trained models. In this paper, we propose Graph Prompt as an efficient and effective alternative to full fine-tuning for adapting the pre-trianed GNN models to downstream tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the effectiveness of prompt tuning on existing pre-trained GNN models. Specifically, without tuning the parameters of the pre-trained GNN model, we train a task-specific graph prompt that Cites: Prefix-tuning: Optimizing continuous prompts for generation
