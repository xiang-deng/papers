Graph representation learning is a significant challenge in graph signal processing (GSP). The flourishing development of graph neural networks (GNNs) provides effective representations for GSP. To effectively learn from graph signals, we propose a regularized graph neural network based on approximate fractional order gradients (FGNN). The regularized graph neural network propagates the information between neighboring nodes. The approximation strategy for calculating fractional order Cites: Cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction with graph lstms
