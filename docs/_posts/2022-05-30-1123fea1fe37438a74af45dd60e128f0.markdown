Three important criteria of existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are (1) test-set accuracy;(2) out-of-distribution accuracy; and (3) explainability. While these criteria have been studied independently, their relationship is unknown. For example, do CNNs that have a stronger out-of-distribution performance have also stronger explainability? Furthermore, most prior feature-importance studies only evaluate methods on 2-3 common vanilla ImageNet-trained CNNs, leaving it … Cites: ‪ERASER: A benchmark to evaluate rationalized NLP models‬
