The superior performance of supervised relation extraction (RE) methods heavily relies on a large amount of gold standard data. Recent zero-shot relation extraction methods converted the RE task to other NLP tasks and used off-the-shelf models of these NLP tasks to directly perform inference on the test data without using a large amount of RE annotation data. A potentially valuable by-product of these methods is the large-scale silver standard data. However, there is no further investigation on the  Cites: A Frustratingly Easy Approach for Entity and Relation Extraction
