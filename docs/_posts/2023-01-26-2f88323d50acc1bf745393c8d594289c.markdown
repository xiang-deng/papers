The development of deep learning technology provides a new development direction for text retrieval. Researchers have applied deep learning techniques to different information retrieval objects and carried out rich studies on them, such as web pages, scientific literature, and scientific data. This paper selects 40 research papers on related topics in the past 10 years through a step-by-step selection and conducts a review on the dimensions of model input, model structure, and its performance Cites: Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering
