Semi-supervised learning has attracted great attention in machine learning for it makes full use of labeled and unlabeled data for training. Most semi-supervised learning methods are not suitable for regression due to the data labels in regression are real-valued and smooth. In this paper, hypergraph instead of graph is utilized to represent the geometric structure of data. The manifold regularization term is constructed by calculating the hypergraph Laplacian and introduced into the …
