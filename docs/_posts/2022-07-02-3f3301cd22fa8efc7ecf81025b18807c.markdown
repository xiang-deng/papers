Extensive research on machine learning models, which in the majority are black-boxes, created a great need for the development of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods. Complex machine learning (ML) models usually require an external explanation method to understand their decisions. The interpretation of the model predictions are crucial in many fields, ie, predictive maintenance, where it is not only required to evaluate the state of an asset, but also to determine the root causes of the
