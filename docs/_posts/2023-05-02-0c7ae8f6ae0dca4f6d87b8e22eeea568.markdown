Deep learning technology is increasingly applied in safety-critical scenarios while it has recently been found to be susceptible to imperceptible adversarial perturbations, which raises a serious concern regarding the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) based applications. Accordingly, various adversarial attacks and defense approaches have been proposed. However, current studies implement different types of attacks and defenses with certain assumptions. There is still a lack  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
