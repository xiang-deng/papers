Event detection is an important subtask of information extraction, aiming to identify triggers and recognize event types in text. Previous state-of-the-art studies using graph neural networks (GNNs) are mainly applied to obtain long distance features of text and have achieved impressive performance. However, these methods face the issues of over-smoothing and semantic feature destruction, when containing multiple GNN layers. For the reasons, this paper proposes an improved GNN model for event  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
