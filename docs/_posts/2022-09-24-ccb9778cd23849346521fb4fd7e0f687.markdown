Ensemble trees are a popular machine learning model which often yields high prediction performance when analysing structured data. Although individual small decision trees are deemed explainable by nature, an ensemble of large trees is often difficult to understand. In this work, we propose an approach called optimised explanation (OptExplain) that faithfully extracts global explanations of ensemble trees using a combination of logical reasoning, sampling and natureinspired …
