Many fields make use nowadays of machine learning (ML) enhanced applications for cost optimization, scheduling or forecasting, including the energy sector. However, these very ML algorithms consume a significant amount of energy, sometimes going against the whole purpose of their employment. To this day, solutions for an energy-efficient execution of these algorithms have not been addressed adequately. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantage of executing ML algorithms on mobile devices Cites: The Carbon Footprint of Machine Learning Training Will Plateau
