In current deep learning architectures, each of the deeper layers in networks tends to contain hundreds of unorganized neurons which makes it hard for humans to understand how they interact with each other. By organizing the neurons using correlation as the criteria, humans can observe how clusters of neighbouring neurons interact with each other. Research in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to all alleviate the black-box nature of current AI methods and make them Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
