Deep neural networks have greatly facilitated the applications of semantic segmentation. However, most of the existing neural networks bring massive calculations with lots of model parameters for achieving a higher precision, which is unaffordable for resource-constrained edge devices. To achieve an appropriate trade-off between computing efficiency and segmentation accuracy, we proposed an effective lightweight attention-guided network (ELANet) for real-time semantic …
