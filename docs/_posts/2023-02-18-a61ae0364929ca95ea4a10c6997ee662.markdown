Data‐driven epoch, the development of machine learning (ML) in materials and device design is an irreversible trend. Its ability and efficiency to handle nonlinear and game‐playing problems is unmatched by traditional simulation computing software and trial‐error experiments. Perovskite solar cells are complex physicochemical devices (systems) that consist of perovskite materials, transport layer materials, and electrodes. Predicting the physicochemical properties and …
