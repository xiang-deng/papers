Language is critical to establishing long-term cooperative relationships among intelligent agents (including people), particularly when the agents  preferences are in conflict. In such scenarios, an agent uses speech to coordinate and negotiate behavior with its partner (s). While recent work has shown that neural language modeling can produce effective speech agents, such algorithms typically only accept previous text as input. However, in relationships among intelligent agents, not all …
