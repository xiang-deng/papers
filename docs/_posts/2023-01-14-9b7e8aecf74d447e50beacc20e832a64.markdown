The mixing ratio of the raw materials has a significant impact on concrete compressive strength. Although the compressive strength of concrete can be inferred from the mix ratio, it is frequently challenging to determine how each mix ratio parameter affects the results. In this study, an Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is applied to predict the concrete compressive strength and explain the contribution of mix ratio factors on the compressive strength.
