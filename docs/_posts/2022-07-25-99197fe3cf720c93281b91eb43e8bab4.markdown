Retrieval question answering (ReQA) is an essential mechanism to automatically satisfy the users information needs and overcome the problem of information overload. As a promising solution to achieve fast retrieval from large-scale candidate answers, dual-encoder framework has been widely studied to improve its representation quality for text in the recent years. Inspired by that humans usually answer the question using their background knowledge, in this work, we explore the  Cites: Real-time open-domain question answering with dense-sparse
