Recently, the advances in deep learning have lead to a surge in research on semantic parsing and question answering over knowledge graphs (KGQA). Significant improvements in these fields and in natural language processing (NLP) in general have been achieved thanks to the use and better understanding of training neural-networks-based models. Particularly important in training any model for any task is their generalization ability. While the generalization ability of machine … Cites: ‪TaBERT: Pretraining for Joint Understanding of Textual and …‬
