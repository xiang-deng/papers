We introduce FLightNER, a Federated Learning model that extends a state-of-the-art Named-Entity Recognition model using prompt-tuning known as LightNER. FLightNER allows the aggregation of only the trainable parameters of LightNER without model accuracy degradation saving 10 GB per client and enabling more clients to join a federation without extending the central server s memory. We evaluate our approach against two baselines using three diverse datasets with …
