In this paper, we establish novel data-dependent upper bounds on the generalization error through the lens of a variable-size compressibility framework that we introduce newly here. In this framework, the generalization error of an algorithm is linked to a variable-size compression rate of its input data. This is shown to yield bounds that depend on the empirical measure of the given input data at hand, rather than its unknown distribution. Our new generalization bounds that we Cites: Catastrophic fisher explosion: Early phase fisher matrix impacts
