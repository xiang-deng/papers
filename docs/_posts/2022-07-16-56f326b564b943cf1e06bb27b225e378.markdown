Abductive Reasoning is a task of inferring the most plausible hypothesis given a set of observations. In literature, the community has approached to solve this challenge by classifying/generating a likely hypothesis that does not contradict with a past observation and future observation. Some of the most well-known benchmarks that tackle this problem are aNLI and aNLG (pronounced as alpha-NLI and alpha-NLG). In this report, I review over some of the methodologies that were attempted to solve …
