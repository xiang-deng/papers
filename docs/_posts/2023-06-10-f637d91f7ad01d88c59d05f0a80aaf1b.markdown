Explainability of intelligent models has been garnering increasing attention in recent years. Of the various explainability approaches, concept-based techniques are notable for utilizing a set of human-meaningful concepts instead of focusing on individual pixels. However, there is a scarcity of methods that consistently provide both local and global explanations. Moreover, most of the methods have no offer to explain misclassification cases. To address these challenges, our study follows a …
