Recently, prompt-based learning has become a very popular solution in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks by inserting a template into model input, which converts the task into a cloze-style one to smoothing out differences between the Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) and the current task. But in the case of relation classification, it is difficult to map the masked output to the relation labels because of its abundant semantic information, eg org: founded_by . Therefore, a pre Cites: Universal adversarial triggers for attacking and analyzing NLP
