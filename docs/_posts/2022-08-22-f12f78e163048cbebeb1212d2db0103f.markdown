Top-$ k $ error has become a popular metric for large-scale classification benchmarks due to the inevitable semantic ambiguity among classes. Existing literature on top-$ k $ optimization generally focuses on the optimization method of the top-$ k $ objective, while ignoring the limitations of the metric itself. In this paper, we point out that the top-$ k $ objective lacks enough discrimination such that the induced predictions may give a totally irrelevant label a top rank. To fix this issue, we Cites: Generalization Bounds for the Area Under the ROC Curve.
