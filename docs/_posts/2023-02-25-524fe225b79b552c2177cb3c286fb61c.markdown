Large language models trained on massive code corpora can generalize to new tasks without the need for taskspecific fine-tuning. In few-shot learning, these models take as input a prompt, composed of natural language instructions, a few instances of task demonstration, and a query and generate an output. However, the creation of an effective prompt for coderelated tasks in few-shot learning has received little attention. We present a technique for prompt creation that automatically retrieves Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
