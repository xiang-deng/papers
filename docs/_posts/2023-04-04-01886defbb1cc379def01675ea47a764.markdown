The construction of a high-quality multi-view consensus graph is key to graph-based semi-supervised multi-view learning (GSSMvL) methods. However, most existing GSSMvL methods explore sample relationships in the original multi-view feature space, which obtains a contaminated graph that cannot reveal the underlying manifold structure of the samples. Moreover, traditional GSSMvL methods fail to explore the diverse structures of multi-view features, which may lose their Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
