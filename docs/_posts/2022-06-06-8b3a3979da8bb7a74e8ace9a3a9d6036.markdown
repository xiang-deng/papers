An increase in demand for semiconductor ICs, recent advancements in machine learning, and the slowing down of Moore s law have all contributed to the increased interest in using Machine Learning (ML) to enhance Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools and processes. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of available EDA and CAD tools, methods, processes, and techniques for Integrated Circuits (ICs) that use machine learning algorithms.
