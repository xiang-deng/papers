Using off-the-shelf resources from resource-rich languages to transfer knowledge to low-resource languages has received a lot of attention. The requirements of enabling the model to achieve the reliable performance, including the scale of required annotated data and the effective framework, are not well guided. To address the first question, we empirically investigate the cost-effectiveness of several methods for training intent classification and slot-filling models from scratch in Indonesia (ID) …
