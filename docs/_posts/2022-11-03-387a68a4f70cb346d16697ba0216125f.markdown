This work aims to predict retweet popularity of covid19 tweet corpus. Our work fuses unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to create retweet popularity model. In the first phase, we use a Clustered Bert model, which works on clustering the Bert embeddings using clustering algorithms on the textual data to generate novel and meaningful feature set for our model. In the second phase, we use the output of Clustered Bert model as an input to the Supervised Regression models Cites: Open sourcing BERT: State-of-the-art pre-training for natural
