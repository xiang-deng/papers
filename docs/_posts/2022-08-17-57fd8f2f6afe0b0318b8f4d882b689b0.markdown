Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are widely used for handling sequence data. However, their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to interpret the decision-making process. We propose a new method to construct deterministic finite automata to explain RNN. In an automaton, states are abstracted from hidden states produced by the RNN, and the transitions represent input symbols. Thus, users can follow the paths of transitions, called patterns, to understand how a prediction is produced Cites: Inducing regular grammars using recurrent neural networks
