Several advances in deep learning have been successfully applied to the software development process. Of recent interest is the use of neural language models to build tools that can assist in writing code. There is a growing body of work to evaluate these tools and their underlying language models. We aim to contribute to this line of research via a comparative empirical analysis of these tools and language models from a security perspective. For the rest of this paper, we use CGT (Code Generation Cites: A syntactic neural model for general-purpose code generation
