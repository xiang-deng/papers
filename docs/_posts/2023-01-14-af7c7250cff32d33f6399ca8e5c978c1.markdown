Abstract Probabilistic Topic Modeling with hundreds of its models and applications has been an efficient text analysis technique for almost twenty years. This research area has evolved mostly within the frame of the Bayesian learning theory. For a long time, the possibility of learning topic models with a simpler conventional (non-Bayesian) regularization remained underestimated and rarely used. The framework of Additive Regularization for Topic Modeling (ARTM) fills this gap. It dramatically …
