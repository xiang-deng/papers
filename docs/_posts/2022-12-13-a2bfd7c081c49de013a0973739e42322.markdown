Abstract Knowledge Graph Completion, especially its sub-task link prediction attracts the attention of the research community and industry because of its applicability as a premise for developing several potential applications. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) shows promising results to solve this problem. This paper focuses on the neural networks-based approach for KGE, which can extract features from the graphs better than other groups of embedding methods. The ConvE model is the first work  Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
