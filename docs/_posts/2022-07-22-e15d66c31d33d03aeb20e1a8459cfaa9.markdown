The availability of data is the driving force behind most of the state-of-the-art techniques for machine translation tasks. Understandably, this availability of data motivates researchers to propose new techniques and claim about the superiority of their techniques over the existing ones by using suitable evaluation measures. However, the performance of underlying learning algorithms can be greatly influenced by the correctness and the consistency of the corpus. We present our Cites: Learning to generate pseudo-code from source code using
