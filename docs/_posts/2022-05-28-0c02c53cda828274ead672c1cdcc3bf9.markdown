Scientific research communities are embracing AI-based solutions to target tractable scientific tasks and improve research work-flows. However, the development and evaluation of such solutions are scattered across multiple disciplines. We formalize the problem of scientific AI benchmarking, and propose a system called SAIBench in the hope of unifying the efforts and enabling low-friction on-boarding of new disciplines. The system approaches this goal with SAIL, a domain-specific language  Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
