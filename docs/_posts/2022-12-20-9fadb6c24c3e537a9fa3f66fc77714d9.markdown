The technology roadmap is used as an essential tool to establish strategies. Existing expert-based and data-based roadmapping processes consume a lot of resources, are difficult to update, and can be biased towards experts subjectivity. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an automated deep learning model Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based technology roadmapping method. The proposed framework consists of two modules. Module 1 uses the GAN model to train the  Cites: A Fast and Accurate Dependency Parser using Neural Networks
