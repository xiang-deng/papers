Abstract Complex Question Answering (CQA) over Knowledge Base (KB) involves transferring natural language questions to a sequence of actions, which are utilized to fetch entities and relations for final answer. Typically, meta-learning based models regard question types as standards to divide dataset for pseudo-tasks. However, question type, manually labeled in CQA data set, is indispensable as a filter in the support set retrieving phase, which raises two main problems. First, preset question Cites: Semantic parsing on freebase from question-answer pairs
