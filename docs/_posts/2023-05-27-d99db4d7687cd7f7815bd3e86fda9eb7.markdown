Unsupervised clustering is widely used to explore large corpora, but existing formulations neither consider the users goals nor explain clusters meanings. We propose a new task formulation, Goal-Driven Clustering with Explanations (GoalEx), which represents both the goal and the explanations as free-form language descriptions. For example, to categorize the errors made by a summarization system, the input to GoalEx is a corpus of annotator-written comments for system-generated  Cites: Scaling instruction-finetuned language models
