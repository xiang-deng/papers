Using econometric models or regression techniques, we can predict the price of a property based upon certain features. In this paper, we try to predict the sale price of the residential properties using advanced regression techniques and determine what features most affect the sale price. We have employed various feature engineering techniques to be applied to the raw data to make it productive for the machine learning models. An approach is discussed for understanding the black-box machine  Cites: Model-Agnostic Interpretability of Machine Learning
