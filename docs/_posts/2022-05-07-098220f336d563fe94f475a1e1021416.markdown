However, prior work has been predicated on the assumption that any generated facts not appearing explicitly in the source are undesired hallucinations. Methods have been proposed to address this scenario by ultimately improvingfaithfulness to the source document, but in Cites: Retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks
