Solving Markov decision processes (MDPs) efficiently is challenging in many cases, for example, when the state space or action space is large, when the reward function is sparse and delayed, and when there is a distribution of MDPs. Structures in the policy, value function, reward function, or state space can be useful in accelerating the learning process. In this thesis, we exploit structures in MDPs to solve them effectively and efficiently. First, we study problems with concave value function and
