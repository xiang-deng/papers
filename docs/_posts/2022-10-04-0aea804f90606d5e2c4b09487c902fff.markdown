Open-set semi-supervised learning (OSSL) has attracted growing interest, which investigates a more practical scenario where out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are only contained in unlabeled data. Existing OSSL methods like OpenMatch learn an OOD detector to identify outliers, which often update all modal parameters (ie, full fine-tuning) to propagate class information from labeled data to unlabeled ones. Currently, prompt learning has been developed to bridge gaps between pre-training  Cites: LST: Ladder Side-Tuning for Parameter and Memory Efficient
