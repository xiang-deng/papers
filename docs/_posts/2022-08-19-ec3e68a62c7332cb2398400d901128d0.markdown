Evolving fuzzy neural networks are models capable of solving complex problems in a wide variety of contexts. In general, the quality of the data evaluated by a model has a direct impact on the quality of the results. Some procedures can generate uncertainty during data collection, which can be identified by experts to choose more suitable forms of model training. This paper proposes the integration of expert input on labeling uncertainty into evolving fuzzy neural classifiers (EFNC) in an approach Cites: Data integration with uncertainty
