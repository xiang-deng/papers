Previous research on code intelligence usually trains a deep learning model on a fixed dataset in an offline manner. However, in real-world scenarios, new code repositories emerge incessantly, and the carried new knowledge is beneficial for providing up-to-date code intelligence services to developers. In this paper, we aim at the following problem: How to enable code intelligence models to continually learn from ever-increasing data? One major challenge here is catastrophic forgetting Cites: Continual Relation Learning via Episodic Memory Activation and
