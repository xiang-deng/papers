Cross-domain text classification utilizes the labeled source domain to train a well-performing classifier for the unlabeled target domain. It is an important task in natural language processing. Owing to the outstanding performance for representations learning, deep learning models are introduced into cross-domain classification to learn domain invariant representations. However, existing methods assume that features in text are independent, ignoring the correlation between features. To this  Cites: Graph convolution over pruned dependency trees improves
