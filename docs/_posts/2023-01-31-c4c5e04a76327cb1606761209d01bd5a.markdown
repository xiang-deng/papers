This work formulates the machine learning mechanism as a bi-level optimization problem. The inner level optimization loop entails minimizing a properly chosen loss function evaluated on the training data. This is nothing but the well-studied training process in pursuit of optimal model parameters. The outer level optimization loop is less well-studied and involves maximizing a properly chosen performance metric evaluated on the validation data. This is what we call the  iteration process , pursuing …
