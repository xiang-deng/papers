Back translation is one of the most widely used methods for improving the performance of neural machine translation systems. Recent research has sought to enhance the effectiveness of this method by increasing the diversity of the generated translations. We argue that the definitions and metrics used to quantify diversity in previous work have been insufficient. This work puts forward a more nuanced framework for understanding diversity in training data, splitting it into lexical diversity  Cites: Meta-Learning to Compositionally Generalize
