Existing online video processing methods such as online action detection focus on a frame-level understanding for high responsiveness. However, it has a fundamental limitation in that it lacks instance-level understanding of videos, making it difficult to be applied to higher-level vision tasks. The instance-level action detection, known as Temporal Action Localization (TAL), have limitations when applying to the online settings. In this work, we introduce a new task that aims to detect action instances of …
