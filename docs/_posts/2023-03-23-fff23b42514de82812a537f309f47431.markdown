Relational triple extraction is aimed at detecting entity pairs with relations from sentences, which is a key technology for large-scale knowledge graph construction. Recent studies focus on the overlapping triple problem, where multiple relational triples may have overlaps in a sentence. However, these methods disregard the bidirectionality of triple extraction, which may lead to extracting invalid triples. In addition, many relational triples are labeled in datasets of the triple extraction task  Cites: Exploiting syntactico-semantic structures for relation extraction
