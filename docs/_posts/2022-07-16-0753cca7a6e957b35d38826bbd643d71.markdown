Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly used to make critical decisions in real-world applications, yet they have also become more complex, making them harder to understand. To this end, several techniques to explain model predictions have been proposed. However, practitioners struggle to leverage explanations because they often do not know which to use, how to interpret the results, and may have insufficient data science experience to obtain explanations.
