Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing links based on observed triples. However, current KGC models are still limited by the following two aspects.(1) the entity semantics is implicitly learned by neural network and merely depends on existing facts, which mostly suffers from less additional specific knowledge. Although previous studies have noticed that entity type information can effectively improve KGC task, most of them rely on labeled type-specific data.(2) the recent graph-based …
