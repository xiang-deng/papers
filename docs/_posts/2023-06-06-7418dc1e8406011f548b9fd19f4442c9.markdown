Automatic tagging on software information sites is a tag recommendation service. It aims to recommend content-based tags for a software object to help developers make distinctions among software objects. Due to deep correlations between software objects and tags, it is challenging to simultaneously consider the code snippet and text description of a software object. Towards automatic tagging service, we propose a novel CDR4Tag method, Code-mixed Deep Representation learning Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
