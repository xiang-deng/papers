The data needed for machine learning (ML) model training and inference, can reside in different separate sites often termed data silos. For data-intensive ML applications, data silos present a major challenge: the integration and transformation of data, demand a lot of manual work and computational resources. Sometimes, data cannot leave the local store, and the model has to be trained in a decentralized manner. In this work, we propose three matrix-based dataset relationship representations, which  Cites: Data integration: After the teenage years
