In this paper, we discuss representation capability for a systematic understanding of connection structures in deep neural networks. Deep learning is a machine learning method using deep neural networks, and various network structures have been proposed. Skip connections are one of the network structures proposed in the ResNet model and are now a significant architecture. Although skip connections are a straightforward structure and their effectiveness has been shown empirically, the …
