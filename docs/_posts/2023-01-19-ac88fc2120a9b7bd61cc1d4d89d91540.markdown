Horn functions form a subclass of Boolean functions possessing interesting structural and computational properties. These functions play a fundamental role in algebra, artificial intelligence, combinatorics, computer science, database theory, and logic. In the present paper, we introduce the subclass of hypergraph Horn functions that generalizes matroids and equivalence relations. We provide multiple characterizations of hypergraph Horn functions in terms of implicate-duality and the  Cites: Reasoning with models
