In this review, a discussion on renewable sources of energy with clear focus on solar cell applications is presented. Especially, possible future directions for development of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are discussed. Dye-sensitized solar cells have become an important topic of research due to its high importance in energy conversion. Current DSSCs are based on either metal dye sensitizers, metal-free organic dyes or natural dyes. They have been extensively studied due to their low Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
