To promote and further develop RST-style discourse parsing models, we need a strong baseline that can be regarded as a reference for reporting reliable experimental results. This paper explores a strong baseline by integrating existing simple parsing strategies, top-down and bottom-up, with various transformer-based pre-trained language models. The experimental results obtained from two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the parsing performance strongly relies on the  Cites: Discourse-Aware Neural Extractive Text Summarization
