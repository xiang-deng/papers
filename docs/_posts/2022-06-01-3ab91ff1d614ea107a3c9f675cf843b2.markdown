Semi-supervised learning (SSL) can utilize a large amount of unlabeled data for self-training and continuous evolution with only a few annotations. This feature makes SSL a potential candidate for dealing with data from changing and real-time environments, where deep-learning models need to be adapting to evolving and nonstable (non-iid) data streams from the real world, ie, online evolutive scenarios. However, state-of-the-art SSL methods often have complex model design Cites: Meta pseudo labels
