Semantic parsing (SP) is a core component of modern virtual assistants like Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. While sequence-to-sequence-based auto-regressive (AR) approaches are common for conversational semantic parsing, recent studies employ non-autoregressive (NAR) decoders and reduce inference latency while maintaining competitive parsing quality. However, a major drawback of NAR decoders is the difficulty of generating top-k (ie, k-best) outputs with approaches such Cites: Compositional Generalization for Neural Semantic Parsing via
