The Storks paper introduces TRIP, a richannotated commonsense reasoning dataset that enables a multi-tiered evaluation of machines reasoning processes. It also proposed a machine-learning reasoning model that is trained on this dataset. The low performance on the system s verifiability calls for better language-understanding models. We tried to improve the baseline system performance in three ways: automatic data augmentation, loss function change, and adding a new module.
