Language models (LMs) such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) have shown impressive abilities in a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, relying solely on their parameters to encode a wealth of world knowledge requires a prohibitively large number of parameters and hence massive computing, and they often struggle to learn long-rail knowledge (Roberts et al., 2020; Kandpal et al., 2022; Mallen et al., 2022). Moreover, these …
