Over the past few years, deep learning (DL) has been continuously expanding its applications and becoming a driving force for large-scale source code analysis in the big code era. Distribution shift, where the test set follows a different distribution from the training set, has been a longstanding challenge for the reliable deployment of DL models due to the unexpected accuracy degradation. Although recent progress on distribution shift benchmarking has been made in domains such as computer vision
