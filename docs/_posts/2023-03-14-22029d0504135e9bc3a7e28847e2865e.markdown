Abstract Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) aligns existing knowledge bases with unstructured text to extract relation facts, and its automatically generated training data is inevitably noisy. Most existing works identify and reduce the impact of noise by enhancing semantic features. However, they only consider the semantic information in a single instance and ignore the semantic information between different instances. In this work, we propose a Semantic Piecewise Convolutional …
