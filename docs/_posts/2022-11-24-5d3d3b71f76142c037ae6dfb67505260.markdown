Abstract The way Complex Machine Learning (ML) models generate their results is not fully understood, including by very knowledgeable users. If users cannot interpret or trust the predictions generated by the model, they will not use them. Furthermore, the human role is often not properly considered in the development of ML systems. In this article, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of Explain-ML, an Interactive Machine Learning (IML) system for Explainable Machine Learning that …
