In this paper, a novel approach is introduced for building semantic networks from scientific publication abstracts. With a seed statement as input, the approach generates a semantic network using Recursive Object Modeling (ROM), Skip-gram language modelling, and semantic similarity methods. Semantic Scholar API was used to retrieve data for building the ROM-based Semantic Networks (RomNet) following Environment-Based Design (EBD) methodology. The RomNet is then Cites: Stanza: A python natural language processing toolkit for many
