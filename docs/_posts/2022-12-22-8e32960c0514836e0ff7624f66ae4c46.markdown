Answering complex logical queries on incomplete knowledge graphs is a challenging task, and has been widely studied. Embedding-based methods require training on complex queries, and cannot generalize well to out-of-distribution query structures. Recent work frames this task as an end-to-end optimization problem, and it only requires a pretrained link predictor. However, due to the exponentially large combinatorial search space, the optimal solution can only be approximated, limiting …
