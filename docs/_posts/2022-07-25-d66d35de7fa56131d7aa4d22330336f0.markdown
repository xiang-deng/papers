This dissertation focuses on using logic to improve neural model performance and evaluation for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The strong performances of recent neural models are often powered by huge amounts of annotated data in an end-to-end training scheme. Yet, models make highly inconsistent predictions with decisions that conflict with each other and have erroneous output structures. There are many intermediate decisions to make in modern NLP tasks, but annotating them  Cites: An information bottleneck approach for controlling conciseness in
