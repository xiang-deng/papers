Named entity recognition is a task to extract named entities with predefined entity types. Span classification is a popular method to support this task. It has the advantage to solve nested structures and make full use of token features in a span. The problem is that exhaustively enumerating and verifying all entity spans suffer from high computational complexity and data imbalance. Furthermore, spans with a high overlapping ratio share the same contextual features in a sentence, which is …
