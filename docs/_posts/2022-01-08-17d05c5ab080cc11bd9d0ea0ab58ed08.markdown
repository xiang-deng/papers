Electronic medical records (EMRs) include many valuable data about patients, which is, however, unstructured. Therefore, there is a lack of both labeled medical text data in Russian and tools for automatic annotation. As a result, today, it is hardly feasible for researchers to utilize text data of EMRs in training machine learning models in the biomedical domain. We present an unsupervised approach to medical data annotation. Syntactic trees are produced from initial sentences using morphological Cites: Deep biaffine attention for neural dependency parsing
