Our goal is a teachable reasoning system for question-answering (QA), where a user can interact with faithful answer explanations, and correct errors so that the system improves over time. Our approach is three-fold: First, generated chains of reasoning show how answers are implied by the system s own internal beliefs. Second, users can interact with the explanations to identify erroneous model beliefs and provide corrections. Third, we augment the model with a dynamic memory of such Cites: Fast model editing at scale
