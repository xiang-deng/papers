Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on diverse general-purpose artificial intelligence tasks including image understanding and computer vision, natural language processing and speech synthesis, robotics and robust controls. However, training such a network is very time- consuming. It usually takes weeks or even months to train an effective deep network, let alone the exploration of diverse network settings. It is very much desired for these Cites: Deep neural networks improve radiologists performance in breast
