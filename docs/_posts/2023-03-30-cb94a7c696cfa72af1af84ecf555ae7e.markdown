While code-mixing is a common linguistic practice in many parts of the world, collecting high-quality and low-cost code-mixed data remains a challenge for natural language processing (NLP) research. The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent times compels one to ask: can these systems be used for data generation? In this article, we explore prompting LLMs in a zero-shot manner to create code-mixed data for five languages in South East Asia (SEA)--Indonesian  Cites: Scaling instruction-finetuned language models
