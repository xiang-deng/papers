We study the challenge of learning causal reasoning over procedural text to answer What if...  questions when external commonsense knowledge is required. We propose a novel multi-hop graph reasoning model to 1) efficiently extract a commonsense subgraph with the most relevant information from a large knowledge graph; 2) predict the causal answer by reasoning over the representations obtained from the commonsense subgraph and the contextual interactions between the Cites: Graph-based reasoning over heterogeneous external knowledge
