The typical way for relation extraction is fine-tuning large pre-trained language models on task-specific datasets, then selecting the label with the highest probability of the output distribution as the final prediction. However, the usage of the Top-k prediction set for a given sample is commonly overlooked. In this paper, we first reveal that the Top-k prediction set of a given sample contains useful information for predicting the correct label. To effectively utilizes the Top-k prediction set, we  Cites: PTR: Prompt tuning with rules for text classification
