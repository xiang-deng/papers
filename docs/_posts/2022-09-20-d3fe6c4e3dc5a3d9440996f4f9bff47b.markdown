In this paper, we establish a last-iterate convergence rate for the classical extragradient (EG) method to approximate a solution of a nonlinear equation involving co-monotone and Lipschitz continuous operator. This equation covers a class of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems as a special case, which is widely used in practice, especially in recent machine learning applications. Next, we prove a last-iterate convergence rate for the past-extragradient (PEG) method, a  Cites: Stochastic variance reduction methods for policy evaluation
