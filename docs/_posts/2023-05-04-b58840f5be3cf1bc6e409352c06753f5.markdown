Dialogue state tracking (DST) task is a core component of task-oriented dialogue systems. Recently, several open-vocabulary-based models were proposed in multi-domain setting, which relies on copy mechanism and slot gate classification modules. However, as the ontology gets more and more complex, it becomes challenging to fill values to slots with type-specific features fully utilized, apply appropriate operation, and tackle the over-trivial carryover problem which used to be …
