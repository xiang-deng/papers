Protein structural classification (PSC) is a supervised problem of assigning proteins into predefined structural (eg, CATH or SCOPe) classes based on the proteins sequence or 3D structural features. We recently proposed PSC approaches that model protein 3D structures as protein structure networks (PSNs) and analyze PSN based protein features, which performed better than or comparable to stateofthe art sequence or other 3D structurebased PSC approaches. However, existing PSN Cites: Structure-based protein function prediction using graph
