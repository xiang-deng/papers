The problem of Data-to-Text Generation (D2T) is usually solved using a modular approach by breaking the generation process into some variant of planning and realisation phases. Traditional methods have been very good at producing high quality texts but are difficult to build for complex domains and also lack diversity. On the other hand, current neural systems offer scalability and diversity but at the expense of being inaccurate. Case-Based approaches try to mitigate the accuracy Cites: Data-to-text generation with macro planning
