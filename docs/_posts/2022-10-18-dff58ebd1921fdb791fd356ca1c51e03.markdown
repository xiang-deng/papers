Common deep learning methods can effectively extract fault characteristics and make recognition of mechanical faults. Nevertheless, the results are undesirable when sufficient labeled training data are unavailable. Although metric learning methods can conduct fault recognition with limited samples, they cannot get satisfactory results due to the fixed relation metric function of manually selected. To address this problem we proposed a prototype augmented network with metric …
