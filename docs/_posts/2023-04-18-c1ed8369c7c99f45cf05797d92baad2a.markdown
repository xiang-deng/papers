Training deep neural networks (DNNs) is a major workload in datacenters today, resulting in a tremendously fast growth of energy consumption. It is important to reduce the energy consumption while completing the DL training jobs early in data centers. In this paper, we propose PowerFlow, a GPU clusters scheduler that reduces the average Job Completion Time (JCT) under an energy budget. We first present performance models for DL training jobs to predict the throughput and Cites: Carbon emissions and large neural network training
