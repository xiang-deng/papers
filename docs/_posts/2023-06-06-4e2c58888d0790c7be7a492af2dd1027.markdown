Most computer vision research focuses on datasets containing thousands of images of commonplace objects. However, many high-impact datasets, such as those in medicine and the geosciences, contain fine-grain objects that require domain-expert knowledge to recognize and are time-consuming to collect and annotate. As a result, these datasets contain few labeled images, and current machine vision models cannot train intensively on them. Originally introduced to correct large-language …
