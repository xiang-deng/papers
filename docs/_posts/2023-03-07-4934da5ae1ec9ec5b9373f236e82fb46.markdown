Question Generation (QG) is an essential task in natural language processing, which aims to generate grammatical questions for given sentences or paragraphs. This task focuses on understanding the structures and semantics of sentences. This paper proposes a graph-enhanced question generation model based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE). We construct a semantic graph by dependency parsing and then encode the graph by iteration of Gated Graph Neural Networks (GGNN). Then Cites: Asking clarification questions in knowledge-based question
