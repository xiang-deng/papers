The field of text generation suffers from a severe shortage of labeled data due to the extremely expensive and time consuming process involved in manual annotation. A natural approach for coping with this problem is active learning (AL), a well-known machine learning technique for improving annotation efficiency by selectively choosing the most informative examples to label. However, while AL has been well-researched in the context of text classification, its application to text generation Cites: Selective annotation makes language models better few-shot
