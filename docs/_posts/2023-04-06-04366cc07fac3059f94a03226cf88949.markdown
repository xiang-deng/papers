Load prediction plays an important role in ensuring the safe and stable operation of the micro-grid power system. Traditional load prediction is mainly aimed at large power grids which different from the micro-grid. Traditional load prediction method has some defects, such as training sample selection, point prediction error and so on. This paper proposes a load interval prediction model of micro-grid based on Grey Wolf Optimization Least Squares Support Vector Machine (GWO-LSSVM). Firstly …
