Image to caption has attracted extensive research attention recently. However, image to poetry, especially Chinese classical poetry, is much more challenging. Previous works mainly focus on generating coherent poetry without taking the contexts of poetry into account. In this paper, we propose an Images2Poem with the Dual CharRNN model which exploits images to generate Chinese classical poems in different contexts. Specifically, we first extract a few keywords representing elements Cites: Chinese poetry generation with recurrent neural networks
