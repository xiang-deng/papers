To balance the trade-off between contextual information and fine-grained information in identifying specific emotions during a dialogue and combine the interaction of hierarchical feature related information, this paper proposes a hierarchical feature interactive fusion network (named DHF-Net), which not only can retain the integrity of the context sequence information but also can extract more fine-grained information. To obtain a deep semantic information, DHF-Net processes the task of recognizing Cites: Glove: Global vectors for word representation
