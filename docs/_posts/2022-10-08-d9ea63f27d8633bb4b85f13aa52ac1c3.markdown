Adversarial training (AT) is proved to reliably improve network s robustness against adversarial data. However, current AT with a pre-specified perturbation budget has limitations in learning a robust network. Firstly, applying a pre-specified perturbation budget on networks of various model capacities will yield divergent degree of robustness disparity between natural and robust accuracies, which deviates from robust network s desideratum. Secondly, the attack strength of adversarial training Cites: Understanding and mitigating the tradeoff between robustness and
