The Premature Obituary of Programming Page 1 symbolic reasoning, to name just a   few. Note I do not argue with the premise that DL will be used to solve many problems   that are solved today by traditional programming methods16 and that software   engineering will evolve to make such systems robust.In this Viewpoint, I am addressing   the orthogonal question of using DL to synthesize programs themselves. DP models   are built by training on millions of lines of code. This code encapsulates known …
