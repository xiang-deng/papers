Supervised machine learning (SML) provides us with tools to efficiently scrutinize large corpora of communication texts. Yet, setting up such a tool involves plenty of decisions starting with the data needed for training, the selection of an algorithm, and the details of model training. We aim at establishing a firm link between communication research tasks and the corresponding state-of-the-art in natural language processing research by systematically comparing the performance of Cites: Linguistic regularities in continuous space word representations
