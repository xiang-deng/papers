Mathematical reasoning is one of the crucial abilities of general artificial intelligence, which requires machines to master mathematical logic and knowledge from solving problems. However, existing approaches are not transparent (thus not interpretable) in terms of what knowledge has been learned and applied in the reasoning process. In this paper, we propose a general Learning by Applying (LeAp) framework to enhance existing models (backbones) in a principled way by explicit knowledge Cites: Unit dependency graph and its application to arithmetic word
