Due to the complexity and diversity of real-world relationships, recommender systems are better suited to represent complex data using heterogeneous information networks (HINs), called HIN-based recommendations. However, it is a challenge to efficiently obtain the embedding and remove the noise from the dataset. In our work, we innovatively propose a recommendation model called Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network Recommendation with Adaptive  Cites: Rhine: relation structure-aware heterogeneous information
