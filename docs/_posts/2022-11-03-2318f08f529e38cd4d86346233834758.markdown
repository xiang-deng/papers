For an actual recommendation system, it generally involves a variety of heterogeneous interactive relationships, such as the typical user-user (U2U), item-item (I2I), and user-item (U2I) interaction relationships. With the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) in embedding various interactive relations, recommendation technology has made gratifying progress in recent years, which benefits lot from its powerful ability in relation modeling. However, most of the existing GNN-based Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
