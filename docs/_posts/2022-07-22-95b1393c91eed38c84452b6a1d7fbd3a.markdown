In recent years, creating and managing knowledge bases have become crucial to the retail product and enterprise domains. We present an automatic knowledge base construction system that mines data from documents. This system can generate training data during the training process without human intervention. Therefore, it is domain-agnostic trainable using only the target domain text corpus and a pre-defined knowledge base. This system is called OASYS and is the first system built  Cites: Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text
