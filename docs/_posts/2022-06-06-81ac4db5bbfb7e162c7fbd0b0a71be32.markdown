Due to the small size and weak characteristics of small objects, the performance of existing object detection algorithms for small objects is not ideal. In this paper, we propose a small object detection network based on feature information enhancement to improve the detection effect of small objects. In our method, two key modules, information enhancement module and dense atrous convolution module, are proposed to enhance the expression and discrimination ability of feature information Cites: Augmentation for small object detection
