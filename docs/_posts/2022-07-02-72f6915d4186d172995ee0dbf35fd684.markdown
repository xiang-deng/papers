We propose an approach to extract speaker embeddings that are robust to speaking style variations in text-independent speaker verification. Typically, speaker embedding extraction includes training a DNN for speaker classification and using the bottleneck features as speaker representations. Such a network has a pooling layer to transform frame-level to utterance-level features by calculating statistics over all utterance frames, with equal weighting. However, self-attentive embeddings Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
