Relation extraction (RE) is a fundamental NLP task that aims to identify relations between some entities regarding a given text. RE forms the basis for many advanced NLP tasks, such as question answering and text summarization, and thus its quality is critical to the relevant downstream applications. However, evaluating the quality of RE models is non-trivial. On the one hand, obtaining ground truth labels for individual test inputs is tedious and even difficult. On the other hand, there is an …
