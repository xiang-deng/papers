Context: Developers often introduce the self-admitted technical debt (SATD), ie, a compromised solution to satisfy the delivery of the current goals, in code comments but don t eliminate them timely in the following software development and maintenance process. Automatically identifying the SATDs to reduce potential harm to software has attracted the attention of researchers. However, existing approaches only identified SATDs at a coarse-grained level, which impacts developers to locate Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
