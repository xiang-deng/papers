Previous studies reveal that due to the lack of annotated resources, rumors presented in minority languages are hard to be detected.

In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot framework based on prompt learning to detect rumors falling in different domains or Cites: Noisy channel language model prompting for few-shot text
