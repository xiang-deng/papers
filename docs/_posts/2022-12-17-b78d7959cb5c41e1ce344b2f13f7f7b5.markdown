Session-based recommendation (SR) has gained increasing attention in recent years. Quite a great amount of studies have been devoted to designing complex algorithms to improve recommendation performance, where deep learning methods account for the majority. However, most of these methods are black-box ones and ignore to provide moderate explanations to facilitate users  understanding, which thus might lead to lowered user satisfaction and reduced system revenues …
