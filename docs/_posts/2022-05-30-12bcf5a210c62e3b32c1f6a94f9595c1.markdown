Deep learning models have made significant progress in automatic program repair. However, the black-box nature of these methods has restricted their practical applications. To address this challenge, this paper presents an interpretable approach for program repair based on sequence-to-sequence models with causal inference and our method is called CPR, short for causal program repair. Our CPR can generate explanations in the process of decision making, which consists of … Cites: ‪Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural …‬
