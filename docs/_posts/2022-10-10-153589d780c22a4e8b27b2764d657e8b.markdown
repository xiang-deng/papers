Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in programming language understanding. Generally, training a DNN model with competitive performance requires massive and high-quality labeled training data. However, collecting and labeling such data is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To tackle this issue, data augmentation has been a popular solution, which delicately increases the training data size, eg, adversarial example generation. However, few …
