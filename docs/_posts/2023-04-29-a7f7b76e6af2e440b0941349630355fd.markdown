With a preliminary exploration of the capability boundaries of LLM (language Large model), we believe that the current mainstream artificial intelligence generally adopts the technical road of attention mechanism+ deep learning + reinforcement learning , which cannot be applied to those fields that are difficult to a lot of trial and error . So, to achieve AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) that works in any field, we have to change the way we do it. Therefore, we propose a set of machine learning Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
