Recent studies have shown that prompt-based fine-tuning improves the performance of large Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for few-shot text classification. Specifically, this type of method transforms the text classification task into the inherent Masked Language Modeling (MLM) with some natural language prompts and verbalizers to bridge the gap between the pre-training stage and the fine-tuning stage. Yet, it is unclear how the prompting knowledge can be transferred across Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
