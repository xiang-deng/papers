Web tables are valuable resources that can enrich existing knowledge bases. Researchers try to make the predictions of columns and column pairs in web tables into entities and relations of knowledge bases, which are known as the Column Type Annotation (CT) and Relation Extraction (RE) tasks in web table interpretation. Learning useful and accurate column vector representations plays the central role in solving the two tasks. A column s semantics can be determined by three kinds of Cites: TABBIE: Pretrained Representations of Tabular Data
