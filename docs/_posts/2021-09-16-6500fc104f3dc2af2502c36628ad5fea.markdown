Fewshot knowledge graph (KG) reasoning is the main focus in the field of knowledge graph reasoning. In order to expand the application fields of the knowledge graph, a large number of studies are based on a large number of training samples. However, we have learnt that there are actually many missing relationships or entities in the knowledge graph, and in most cases, there are not many training instances when implementing new relationships. To tackle it, in this study, the Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
