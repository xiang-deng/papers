Adaptive attacks are known to defeat most adversarial defenses including state-of-the-art ones, so conventional defenses either reduce the classification accuracy or are completely broken. To overcome this problem, an encryption-inspired adversarial defense with a secret key was proposed motivated by image encryption methods. The adversarial defense with a secret key achieves high classification performance even when adaptive attacks were carried out. The adversarial defense was also … Cites: ‪Certified defenses against adversarial examples‬
