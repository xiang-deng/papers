Recent work has proposed artificial intelligence (AI) models that can learn to decide whether to make a prediction for an instance of a task or to delegate it to a human by considering both parties capabilities. In simulations with synthetically generated or context-independent human predictions, delegation can help improve the performance of human-AI teams--compared to humans or the AI model completing the task alone. However, so far, it remains unclear how humans perform and how  Cites: What can ai do for me? evaluating machine learning
