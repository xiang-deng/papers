We propose a method for arbitrary textual style transfer (TST)--the task of transforming a text into any given style--utilizing general-purpose pre-trained language models. Our method, Prompt-and-Rerank, is based on a mathematical formulation of the TST task, decomposing it into three constituent components: textual similarity, target style strength, and fluency. Specifically, our method first uses zero-shot or few-shot prompting to obtain a set of candidate generations in the target … Cites: ‪Reformulating Unsupervised Style Transfer as Paraphrase …‬
