Many visualization techniques have been created to help explain the behavior of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but they largely consist of static diagrams that convey limited information. Interactive visualizations can provide more rich insights and allow users to more easily explore a model s behavior; however, they are typically not easily reusable and are specific to a particular model. We introduce Visual Feature Search, a novel interactive visualization that is generalizable to any Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
