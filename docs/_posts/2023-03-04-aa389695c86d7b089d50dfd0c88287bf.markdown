Automated Program Repair (APR) techniques have shown more and more promising results in fixing real-world bugs. Despite the effectiveness, APR techniques still face an overfitting problem: a generated patch can be incorrect although it passes all tests. It is time-consuming to manually evaluate the correctness of generated patches that can pass all tests. To address this problem, many approaches have been proposed to automatically assess the correctness of patches generated by APR …
