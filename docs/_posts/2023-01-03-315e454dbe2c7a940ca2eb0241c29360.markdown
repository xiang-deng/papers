The high demand for labeled data that characterizes deep learning is very labor-intensive. Semi-supervised Learning (SSL), acting as one of the breakthroughs, allows for the avoidance of this labeling loss thanks to its small amount of labeled data, alongside extracting information from a large amount of unlabeled data. And there is hope that the same performance for SSL can be achieved when compared to supervised learning methods. Regrettably, the research community has often …
