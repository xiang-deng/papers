In this work, we share our experience on tele-knowledge pre-training for fault analysis. Fault analysis is a vital task for tele-application, which should be timely and properly handled. Fault analysis is also a complex task, that has many sub-tasks. Solving each task requires diverse tele-knowledge. Machine log data and product documents contain part of the tele-knowledge. We create a Tele-KG to organize other tele-knowledge from experts uniformly. With these valuable tele-knowledge Cites: TaBERT: Pretraining for joint understanding of textual and tabular
