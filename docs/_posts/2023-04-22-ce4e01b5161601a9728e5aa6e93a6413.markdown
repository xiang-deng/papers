Knee osteoarthritis is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder that predominantly affects the elderly population and is typified by the gradual deterioration and attrition of articular cartilage in the knee joint. One commonly employed technique to evaluate the extent of knee osteoarthritis is the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, which evaluates joint space narrowing, osteophytes, sclerosis, and bony deformity visible on radiographic images. The purpose of this study is to compare and contrast the Cites: Attention-based cnn for kl grade classification: Data from the
