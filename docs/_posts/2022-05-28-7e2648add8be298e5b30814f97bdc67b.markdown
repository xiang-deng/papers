In this paper, we propose Descriptive Knowledge Graph (DKG)-an open and interpretable form of modeling relationships between entities. In DKGs, relationships between entities are represented by relation descriptions. For instance, the relationship between entities of machine learning and algorithm can be described as  Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.  To construct DKGs, we propose a self … Cites: ‪Open information extraction from the web‬
