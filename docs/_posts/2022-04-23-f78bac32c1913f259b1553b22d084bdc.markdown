Natural language processing can facilitate the analysis of a person s mental state from text they have written. Previous studies have developed models that can predict whether a person is experiencing a mental health condition from social media posts with high accuracy. Yet, these models cannot explain why the person is experiencing a particular mental state. In this work, we present a new method for explaining a person s mental state from text using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). Our MCTS Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
