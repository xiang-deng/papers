py-irt is a Python library for fitting Bayesian item response theory (IRT) models. At present, there is no Python package for fitting large-scale IRT models. py-irt estimates latent traits of subjects and items, making it appropriate for use in IRT tasks as well as in ideal point models. py-irt is built on top of the Pyro and PyTorch frameworks and uses GPU-accelerated training to scale to large data sets. It is the first Python package for large-scale IRT model fitting. py-irt is easy to use for Cites: Comparing test sets with item response theory
