We tackle the problem of learning classification models with very small amounts of labeled data (eg, less than 10% of the dataset) by introducing a novel Single View Co-Training strategy supported by Reinforcement Learning (CoRL). CoRL is a novel semi-supervised learning framework that can be used with a single view (representation). Differently from traditional co-training that requires at least two sufficient and independent data views (eg, modes), our solution is applicable to any Cites: BERT: pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
