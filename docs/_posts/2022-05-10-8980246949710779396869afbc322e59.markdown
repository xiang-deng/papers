This work describes the use of strings as models for the representation of temporal datathat is, events and times, and their linear ordering and temporal inter-relations to form the basis of a framework for reasoning about that data and using it to aid in the creation or validation of semantic temporal annotation. Some of the relevant motivating literature is examined, in particular Allen (1983) s interval algebra and relation set and the TimeML Cites: Discourse representation structure parsing with recurrent neural
