Automated program repair is the task of automatically repairing software bugs. A promising direction in this field is self-supervised learning, a learning paradigm in which repair models are trained without commits representing pairs of bug/fix. In self-supervised neural program repair, those bug/fix pairs are generated in some ways. The main problem is to generate interesting and diverse pairs that maximize the effectiveness of training. As a contribution to this problem, we propose to use back Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
