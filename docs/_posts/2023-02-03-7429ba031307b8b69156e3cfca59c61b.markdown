We introduce a scalable and fast method for solving distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Previous works have demonstrated that DRO outperforms empirical risk on a collection of inconsistent distribution of test data (the property of uncertainty set). However, DRO is hard to be applied for large-scale datasets and large parameterized model, due to the datapoint-level and non-differentiable objective function. In this paper, we formalize the DRO problem with the supremum of Cites: Modeling the Second Player in Distributionally Robust Optimization
