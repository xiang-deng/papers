Using word embeddings has become the default strategy when representing natural language data. Traditional word embeddings learn a fixed real-valued vector representation of each word in a corpus that encodes semantic information. This thesis proposes using subspaces to represent sentences and texts based on such word embeddings. The motivation behind this idea comes from a crucial aspect of these embeddings: Performing arithmetic and distance calculations between two …
