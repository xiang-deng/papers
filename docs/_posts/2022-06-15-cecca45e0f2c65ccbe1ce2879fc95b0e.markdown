In this paper, we introduce Gauchobot, a task-oriented dialogue system developed for the Alexa Prize Taskbot Challenge. We identified two main obstacles to building better conversational AI assistants in real-world applications. The first is great human efforts needed in data annotation and engineering a dialogue system that provides service in a new domain from scratch. The high cost, often ignored by existing research work, has blocked the broad deployment of dialogue systems. The second Cites: Language models as knowledge bases?
