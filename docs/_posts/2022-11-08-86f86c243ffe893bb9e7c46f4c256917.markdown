Many recent studies have shown that representations drawn from neural network language models are extremely effective at predicting brain responses to natural language. But why do these models work so well? One proposed explanation is that language models and brains are similar because they have the same objective: to predict upcoming words before they are perceived. This explanation is attractive because it lends support to the popular theory of predictive coding. We provide  Cites: Fine-tuning pretrained language models: Weight initializations
