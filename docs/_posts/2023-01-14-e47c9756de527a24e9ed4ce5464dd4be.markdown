Shear-wave velocity plays a crucial role in prestack elastic inversion, reservoir sensitive parameter analysis, and in situ stress analysis [1–5]. Limited by cost and current acquisition technology, shear-wave velocity is generally lacking in conventional logging data in most areas, especially in old wells. Therefore, developing a reliable and low-cost prediction method of shear-wave velocity is extremely important. Previously, the empirical formula [6, 7] and the petrophysical …
