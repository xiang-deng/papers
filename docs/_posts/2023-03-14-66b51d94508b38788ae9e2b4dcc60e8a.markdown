The intersection of quality assurance (QA) and machine learning (ML) is a research area that has sparked interest in recent years. In this thesis, the focus is on traditional ML, which includes all types of ML algorithms except deep learning. To this end, we set out to investigate the context of different ML-based systems (MLS) and the QA goals that are applicable to ML. By snowballing three recent literature reviews and surveys, and analysing the collected set of papers, we created a curated list of …
