We study neural data-to-text generation to generate a sentence to describe a target entity based on its attributes. Specifically, we address two problems of the encoder-decoder framework for data-to-text generation: i) how to encode a non-linear input (eg, a set of attributes); and ii) how to order the attributes in the generated description. Existing studies focus on the encoding problem but do not address the ordering problem, ie, they learn the content-planning implicitly.
