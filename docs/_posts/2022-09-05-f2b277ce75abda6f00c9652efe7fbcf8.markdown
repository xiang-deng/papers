Data explosion is becoming a well-known concern as a result of rapid improvements in Internet-related technologies. The ease with which people can share and access information over the Internet has resulted in an abundance of data on any topic. Text summarization powered by deep neural networks can analyse vast volumes of text input and create a short summary on any topic to address the problem of information overload. However, deep neural networks require a lot of labelled data, and Cites: Text summarization with pretrained encoders
