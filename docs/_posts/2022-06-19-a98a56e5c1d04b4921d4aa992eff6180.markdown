Question answering (QA) over knowledge bases provides a user-friendly way of accessing the massive amount of information stored in them. We have experienced tremendous progress in the performance of QA systems, thanks to the recent advancements in representation learning by deep neural models. However, such deep models function as black boxes with an opaque reasoning process, are brittle, and offer very limited control (eg for debugging an erroneous model prediction). It is Cites: Compositional generalization and natural language variation: Can
