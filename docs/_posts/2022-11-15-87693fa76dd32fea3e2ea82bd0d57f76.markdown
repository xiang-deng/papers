Dynamic networks have been extensively explored as they can considerably improve the model s representation power with acceptable computational cost. The common practice in implementing dynamic networks is to convert given static layers into fully dynamic ones where all parameters are dynamic and vary with the input. Recent studies empirically show the trend that the more dynamic layers contribute to ever-increasing performance. However, such a fully dynamic setting 1) may cause …
