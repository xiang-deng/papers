Learning sentence representation is a fundamental task in natural language processing and has been studied extensively. Recently, many works have obtained high-quality sentence representation based on contrastive learning from pre-trained models. However, these works suffer the inconsistency of input forms between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Also, they typically encode a sentence independently and lack feature interaction between sentences. To conquer these  Cites: SLM: Learning a discourse language representation with sentence
