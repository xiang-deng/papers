Procedural planning, which entails decomposing a high-level goal into a sequence of temporally ordered steps, is an important yet intricate task for machines. It involves integrating common-sense knowledge to reason about complex contextualized situations that are often counterfactual, eg scheduling a doctor s appointment without a phone . While current approaches show encouraging results using large language models (LLMs), they are hindered by drawbacks such as costly API calls  Cites: Finetuned language models are zero-shot learners
