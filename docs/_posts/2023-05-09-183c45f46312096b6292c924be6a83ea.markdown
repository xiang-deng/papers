Designing an effective learning method remains a challenge in neural dialogue generation systems as it requires the training objective to well approximate the intrinsic human-preferred dialogue properties. Conventional training approaches such as maximum likelihood estimation focus on modeling general syntactic patterns and may fail to capture intricate conversational characteristics. Contrastive dialogue learning offers an effective training schema by explicitly training a neural dialogue …
