With the rapid growth of cross-modal data, cross-modal retrieval has become a research hotspot in the field of remote sensing, and remote-sensing image–text retrieval (RSITR) has attracted extensive attention for its flexible and efficient way to get the interested information and its available application. However, most of the existing methods cannot adequately extract fine unimodal features and are poor at exploring potential correlations between different modalities, leading to …
