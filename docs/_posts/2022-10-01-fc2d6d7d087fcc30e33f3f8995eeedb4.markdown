Automatic academic paper rating (AAPR) remains a difficult but useful task to automatically predict whether to accept or reject a paper. Having found more task-specific structure features of academic papers, we present a modularized hierarchical attention network (MHAN) to predict paper quality. MHAN uses a three-level hierarchical attention network to shorten the sequence for each level. In the network, the modularized parameter distinguishes the semantics of functional …
