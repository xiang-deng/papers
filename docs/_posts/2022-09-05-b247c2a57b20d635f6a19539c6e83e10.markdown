Class incremental learning from a pre-trained DNN model is gaining lots of popularity. Unfortunately, the pre-trained model also introduces a new attack vector, which enables an adversary to inject a backdoor into it and further compromise the downstream models learned from it. Prior works proposed backdoor attacks against the pre-trained models in the transfer learning scenario. However, they become less effective when the adversary does not have the knowledge of the downstream tasks Cites: Red Alarm for Pre-trained Models: Universal Vulnerability to
