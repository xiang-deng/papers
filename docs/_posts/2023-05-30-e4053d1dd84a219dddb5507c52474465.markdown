Source code summarization is the task of writing natural language descriptions of source code. The primary use of these descriptions is in documentation for programmers. Automatic generation of these descriptions is a high value research target due to the time cost to programmers of writing these descriptions themselves. In recent years, a confluence of software engineering and artificial intelligence research has made inroads into automatic source code summarization through Cites: Autofolding for source code summarization
