Unsupervised extractive summarization aims to extract salient sentences from the document without labeled corpus. Existing methods have achieved promising progress, thanks to the power of large-scale pre-trained language models and high-quality contextualized representations. However, extractive summaries often fail to maintain smooth transitions between sentences and struggle to form a coherent and fluent text due to splicing of sentences. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge Cites: KILT: a benchmark for knowledge intensive language tasks
