Real-time crop canopy nitrogen concentration (CNC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) sensing capability can enable precision agriculture with significant economic and ecological benefits. Canopy spectral response in visible near-infrared (VNIR, 400979 nm) has been widely used to estimate CNC and AGB of canopies but is often confounded by the soil background, crop type, phenological changes and environmental conditions. Machine (ML) and deep learning (DL) have emerged as  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
