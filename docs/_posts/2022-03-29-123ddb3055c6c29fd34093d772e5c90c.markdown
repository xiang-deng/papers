The definition generation task can help language learners by providing explanations for unfamiliar words. This task has attracted much attention in recent years. We propose a novel task of Simple Definition Generation (SDG) to help language learners and low literacy readers. A significant challenge of this task is the lack of learner s dictionaries in many languages, and therefore the lack of data for supervised training. We explore this task and propose a multitasking framework Cites: Sentence simplification with deep reinforcement learning
