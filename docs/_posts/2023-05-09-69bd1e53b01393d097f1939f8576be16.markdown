Using pre-trained language models to obtain code embeddings is a common and effective practice in the field of source code comprehension. However, language models pre-trained on natural language text fail to capture some intrinsic characteristics of code snippets since programming languages are in a quite different form from natural language. In this paper, we present Functionality-aware Code Embeddings (FaCE) in terms of contrastive learning. The key idea of this work is that  Cites: Dawn Drain, Neel Sundaresan, Jian Yin, Daxin Jiang, and Ming
