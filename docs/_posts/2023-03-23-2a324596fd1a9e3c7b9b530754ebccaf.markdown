Leaderboard systems allow researchers to objectively evaluate Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and are typically used to identify models that exhibit superior performance on a given task in a predetermined setting. However, we argue that evaluation on a given test dataset is just one of many performance indications of the model. In this paper, we claim leaderboard competitions should also aim to identify models that exhibit the best performance in a real-world setting. We highlight …
