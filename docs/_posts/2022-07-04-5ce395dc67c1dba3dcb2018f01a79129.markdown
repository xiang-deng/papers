Abstract Domain adaptation on text summarization task is always challenging, which is caused by the lack of annotated data in the target domain. Previous methodologies focused more on introducing knowledge in the target domain and shifted the model to the target domain. However, they mostly studied the adaptation to a single low-resource domain, which restricted practicality. In this paper, we propose MTL-DAS, a unified model for multidomain adaptive text summarization, which stands for …
