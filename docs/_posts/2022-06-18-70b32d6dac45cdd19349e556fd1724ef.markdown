We address the problem of data augmentation for video action recognition. Standard augmentation strategies in video are hand-designed and sample the space of possible augmented data points either at random, without knowing which augmented points will be better, or through heuristics. We propose to learn what makes a good video for action recognition and select only high-quality samples for augmentation. In particular, we choose video compositing of a foreground and a background video as …
