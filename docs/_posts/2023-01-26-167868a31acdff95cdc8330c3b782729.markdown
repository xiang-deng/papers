To use deep learning, one needs to be familiar with various software tools like TensorFlow or Keras, as well as various model architecture and optimization best practices. Despite recent progress in software usability, deep learning remains a highly specialized occupation. To enable people with limited machine learning and programming experience to adopt deep learning, we developed AutoKeras, an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) library that automates the process of model  Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
