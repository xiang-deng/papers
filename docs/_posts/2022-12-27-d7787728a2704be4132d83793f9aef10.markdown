State-of-the-art object detectors are treated as black boxes due to their highly non-linear internal computations. Even with unprecedented advancements in detector performance, the inability to explain how their outputs are generated limits their use in safety-critical applications. Previous work fails to produce explanations for both bounding box and classification decisions, and generally make individual explanations for various detectors. In this paper, we propose an open-source Cites: Is Attention Interpretable?
