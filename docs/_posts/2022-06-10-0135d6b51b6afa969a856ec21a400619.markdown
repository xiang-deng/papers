Entity Linking aims to connect mentioned names in a text to unambiguous entities in a knowledge base. State-of-the-art approaches are deep neural network models based on one or more instances of BERT. With the use of a Candidate Generation step between Mention Detection and Entity Disambiguation, these approaches tend to break the end-to-end capabilities of training deep neural networks. This thesis aims to investigate an end-to-end approach that combines Mention Detection and Cites: Knowledge enhanced contextual word representations
