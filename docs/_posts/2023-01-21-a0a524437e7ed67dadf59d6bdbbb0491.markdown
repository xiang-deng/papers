The gradient-based meta learning and its approximation algorithms have been widely used in the few-shot scenarios. In practice, it is common for the trained meta-model to employ uniform settings for gradient descent steps across different tasks. However, the meta-model may be biased toward some tasks. The convergence issue occurs that some tasks may see convergence in a few steps while others fail to approach the optimum in the whole inner loop. The bias problem may cause the Cites: Taming maml: Efficient unbiased meta-reinforcement learning
