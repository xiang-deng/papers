Robustness and fairness are two equally important issues for machine learning systems. Despite the active research on robustness and fairness of ML recently, these efforts focus on either fairness or robustness, but not both. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we design Fair and Robust Classification (FRoC) models that equip the classification models with both fairness and robustness. Meeting both fairness and robustness constraints is not trivial due to the tension between them. The trade-off  Cites: Adversarial examples for evaluating reading comprehension systems
