The evolution of internet services has raised many information retrieval systems, and the use of intelligent services for the Question Answering (QA) systems has been on ascending. QA system identifies the accurate answers briefly, and the answers are identified through natural language expressions. Developing intelligent techniques for QA has been an abiding issue, and it has been studied for over years. Though, different QA models focus on common-sense and general questions in open fields  Cites: QA Dataset Explosion: A Taxonomy of NLP Resources for
