Abstract Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a challenging classification task. Due to the subjectivity and ambiguity of performers and spectators, compound facial expression is hard to be represented by one-hot label. In this paper, a simple but efficient method, named Real Emotion Seeker (RES), is proposed to recalibrate the annotation of sample to latent expression distribution besides one-hot label. In particular, subjective implicit knowledge is transformed into posterior distribution
