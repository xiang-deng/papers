Dense passage retrieval aims to retrieve the relevant passages of a query from a large corpus based on dense representations (ie, vectors) of the query and the passages. Recent studies have explored improving pre-trained language models to boost dense retrieval performance. This paper proposes CoT-MAE (ConTextual Masked Auto-Encoder), a simple yet effective generative pre-training method for dense passage retrieval. CoT-MAE employs an asymmetric encoder-decoder Cites: Few-shot conversational dense retrieval
