ChatGPT has revolutionized many research and industrial fields. ChatGPT has shown great potential in software engineering to boost various traditional tasks such as program repair, code understanding, and code generation. However, whether automatic program repair (APR) applies to deep learning (DL) programs is still unknown. DL programs, whose decision logic is not explicitly encoded in the source code, have posed unique challenges to APR. While to repair DL programs, an APR …
