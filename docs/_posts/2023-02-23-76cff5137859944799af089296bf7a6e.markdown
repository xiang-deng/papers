Evaluation in Information Retrieval relies on post-hoc empirical procedures, which are time-consuming and expensive operations. To alleviate this, Query Performance Prediction (QPP) models have been developed to estimate the performance of a system without the need for human-made relevance judgements. Such models, usually relying on lexical features from queries and corpora, have been applied to traditional sparse IR methods-with various degrees of success.
