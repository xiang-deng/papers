Data-driven learning uncontroversially plays a role in human language acquisition---how large a role is a matter of much debate. The success of artificial neural networks in NLP in recent years calls for a re-evaluation of our understanding of the possibilities for learning grammar from data alone. This dissertation argues the case for using artificial neural networks to test hypotheses about human language acquisition and presents progress towards this goal from multiple directions …
