While much recent work has demonstrated that hard negative mining can be used to train better bi-encoder models, few have considered it in the context of cross- encoders, which are key ingredients in modern retrieval pipelines due to their high effectiveness. One noteworthy exception comes from Gao et al.[13], who propose to train cross-encoders by adapting the well-known NCE loss and augmenting it with a localized selection of hard negative examples from the first-stage retriever, which Cites: Covidex: Neural ranking models and keyword search infrastructure
