Abstract Machine learning techniques have attracted increasing attention in learning Branch-and-Bound (B&B) variable selection policies, but most of the existing methods lack extensions to heterogeneous problems. Though parameterizing search trees has recently shown a promising alternative for heterogeneous scenarios, it remains challenging to maintain good performance when generalizing to instances comparatively harder to solve than those seen during training. To fill this gap, we Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
