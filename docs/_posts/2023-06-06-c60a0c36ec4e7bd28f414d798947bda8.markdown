Prior research on affective event classification showed that exploiting weakly labeled data for training can improve model performance. In this work, we propose a simpler and more effective approach for generating training data by automatically acquiring and labeling affective events with Multiple View Co-prompting, which leverages two language model prompts that provide independent views of an event. The approach starts with a modest amount of gold data and prompts pre-trained language models  Cites: oLMpics - On what Language Model Pre-training Captures
