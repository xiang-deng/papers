Processing structured data has become an interesting topic in recent years. The development of graph-based semi-supervised learning models has attracted much attention from machine learning researchers. In this paper, we present a novel approach for graph-based semi-supervised learning. We provide an effective method for simultaneous label recovery and linear transformation estimation. The targeted linear transformation is to obtain a discriminant subspace. The most important factor Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
