In this paper, to extract the manifold information from multi-view data and enhance the clustering performance of a multi-view learning method, the multi-view subspace enhanced representation of manifold regularization and low-rank tensor constraint (MSERMLRT) method is introduced. Our model uses a tensor to explore the correlation between views. The tensor is constrained with a low-rank, and the purpose of such processing is to reduce the redundant information of the learned …
