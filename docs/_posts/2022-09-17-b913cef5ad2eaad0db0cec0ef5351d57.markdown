Word-level Quality Estimation (QE) of Machine Translation (MT) aims to find out potential translation errors in the translated sentence without reference. Typically, conventional works on word-level QE are designed to predict the translation quality in terms of the post-editing effort, where the word labels ( OK and BAD ) are automatically generated by comparing words between MT sentences and the post-edited sentences through a Translation Error Rate (TER) toolkit.
