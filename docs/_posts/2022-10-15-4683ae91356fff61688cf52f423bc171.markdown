Understanding binary code is an essential but complex software engineering task for reverse engineering, malware analysis, and compiler optimization. Unlike source code, binary code has limited semantic information, which makes it challenging for human comprehension. At the same time, compiling source to binary code, or transpiling among different programming languages (PLs) can provide a way to introduce external knowledge into binary comprehension. We propose to develop …
