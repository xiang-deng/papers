Proteins are the essential biological macromolecules required to perform nearly all biological processes, and cellular functions. Proteins rarely carry out their tasks in isolation but interact with other proteins (known as protein–protein interaction) present in their surroundings to complete biological activities. The knowledge of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) unravels the cellular behavior and its functionality. The computational methods automate the prediction of PPI and are less expensive … Cites: ‪Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications‬
