Abstract Java Code Generation consists in generating automatically Java code from a Natural Language Text. This NLP task helps in increasing programmers productivity by providing them with immediate solutions to the simplest and most repetitive tasks. Code generation is a challenging task because of the hard syntactic rules and the necessity of a deep understanding of the semantic aspect of the programming language. Many works tried to tackle this task using either RNN-based  Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
