The presence of clouds in satellite imagery may pose hindrances to the accurate and reliable analysis of the objects present on the land. Therefore, automatic cloud detection is a vital pre-processing step before lending the satellite images to any further analysis. This is a challenging task due to the varying thickness and densities of clouds. It is also very difficult to distinguish clouds from certain terrains such as snow and white sandy beaches.
