Two-view knowledge graphs (KGs) jointly represent two components: an ontology view for abstract and commonsense concepts, and an instance view for specific entities that are instantiated from ontological concepts. As such, these KGs contain heterogeneous structures that are hierarchical, from the ontology-view, and cyclical, from the instance-view. Despite these various structures in KGs, most recent works on embedding KGs assume that the entire KG belongs to only one of the two views  Cites: Convolutional 2d knowledge graph embeddings
