Despite the rich existing literature about minimax optimization in continuous settings, only very partial results of this kind have been obtained for combinatorial settings. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing a characterization of submodular minimax optimization, the problem of finding a set (for either the min or the max player) that is effective against every possible response. We show when and under what conditions we can find such sets. We also demonstrate how minimax submodular optimization Cites: Unsupervised dense information retrieval with contrastive learning
