The interest of LSP and companies in neural machine translation solutions is growing worldwide and in Switzerland. One large Swiss insurance company that is turning its attention towards MT is la Mobilire.

This was achieved using automatic metrics (BLEU and TER) and human evaluations. Our results show that a trained Cites: Linguistic regularities in continuous space word representations
