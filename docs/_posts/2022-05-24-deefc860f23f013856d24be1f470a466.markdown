People frequently interact with information retrieval (IR) systems, however, IR models exhibit biases and discrimination towards various demographics. The in-processing fair ranking methods provide a trade-offs between accuracy and fairness through adding a fairness-related regularization term in the loss function. However, there haven t been intuitive objective functions that depend on the click probability and user engagement to directly optimize towards this. In this work, we propose the In  Cites: Well-read students learn better: On the importance of pre-training
