Abstract Numerical Table-Text Question Answering aims to predict the program over heterogeneous tabular and textual information, which has recently attracted strong attention in the NLP research community. Current state-of-the-art methods typically use a Seq2Seq-based model to predict programs, which may suffer from the inherent limitations of error propagation. Also, existing models just combine table-text context information and previously predicted operation when reasoning. This approach may  Cites: Neural symbolic reader: Scalable integration of distributed and
