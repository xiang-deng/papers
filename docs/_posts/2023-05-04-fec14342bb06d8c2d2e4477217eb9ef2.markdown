Contrastive learning has recently established itself as a powerful self-supervised learning framework for extracting rich and versatile data representations. Broadly speaking, contrastive learning relies on a data augmentation scheme to generate two versions of the input data and learns low-dimensional representations by maximizing a normalized temperature-scaled cross entropy loss (NT-Xent) to identify augmented samples corresponding to the same original entity. In this paper, we …
