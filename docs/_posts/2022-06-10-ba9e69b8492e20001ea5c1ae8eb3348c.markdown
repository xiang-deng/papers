The emerging field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to bring transparency to today s powerful but opaque deep learning models. While local XAI methods explain individual predictions in form of attribution maps, thereby identifying where important features occur (but not providing information about what they represent), global explanation techniques visualize what concepts a model has generally learned to encode. Both types of methods thus only provide partial insights  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
