For a target utterance, its emotion is jointly determined by multiple factors, such as conversation topics, emotion labels and intra/inter-speaker influences, in the conversational context of it. Then an important research question arises: can the effects of these contextual factors be sufficiently captured by the current CER models? To answer this question, we carry out an empirical study on …
