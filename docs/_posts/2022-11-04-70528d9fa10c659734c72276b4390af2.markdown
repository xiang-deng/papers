Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have demonstrated significant performance improvements for generating diverse discrete objects $ x $ given a reward function $ R (x) $, indicating the utility of the object and trained independently from the GFlowNet by supervised learning to predict a desirable property $ y $ given $ x $. We hypothesize that this can lead to\textit {incompatibility} between the inductive optimization biases in training $ R $ and in training the GFlowNet, potentially leading …
