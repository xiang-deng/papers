There is a growing need for NLP systems that support low-resource settings, for which task-specific training data may be lacking, while domain-specific corpora is too scarce to build a reliable system. In the past decade, the co-occurrence-based training objectives of methods such as word2vec are first able to offer word-level semantic information for specific domains. Recently, pretrained language model architectures such as BERT have been shown capable of learning monolingual or …
