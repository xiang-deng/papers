The rapid development of social media makes it easy for people to acquire information while also providing a platform for publishing and spreading fake news. Fake news brings plenty of explicit and implicit risks to social stability, making fake news detection an issue that deserves attention. Recent methods based on graph neural networks (GNN) achieve impressive results in fake news detection, but their performance is still limited in practice due to the absence of high-order relations Cites: Compare to the knowledge: Graph neural fake news detection with
