Temperature is a widely used hyperparameter in various tasks involving neural networks, such as classification or metric learning, whose choice can have a direct impact on the model performance. Most of existing works select its value using hyperparameter optimization methods requiring several runs to find the optimal value. We propose to analyze the impact of temperature on classification tasks by describing a dataset as a set of statistics computed on representations on which we  Cites: Softmax q-distribution estimation for structured prediction: A
