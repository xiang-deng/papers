Edge-cloud system is a crucial computing infrastructure for the innovations of modern society. In addition, the high interest in the edge-cloud system leads to various studies for testing to ensure the reliability of the system. However, like traditional software systems, the amount of resources for testing is always limited. Thus, we suggest CodeBERT Based Just-In-Time (JIT) Software Defect Prediction (SDP) model to address the limitation. This method helps practitioners prioritize the limited  Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
