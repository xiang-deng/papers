Being able to create meaningful symbols and proficiently use them for higher cognitive functions such as communication, reasoning, planning, etc., is essential and unique for human intelligence. Current deep neural networks are still far behind human s ability to create symbols for such higher cognitive functions. Here we propose a solution, named SEA-net, to endow neural networks with ability of symbol creation, semantic understanding and communication. SEA-net generates symbols  Cites: On the opportunities and risks of foundation models
