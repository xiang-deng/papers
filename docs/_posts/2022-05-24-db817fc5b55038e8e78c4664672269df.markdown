Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for building an intelligent system, which involves multiple self-operated agents to collectively accomplish a designated task. More importantly, there has been a renewed focus on RL since the introduction of deep learning that essentially makes RL feasible to operate in high-dimensional environments. However, there are many diversified research directions in the current literature, such as multi-agent and multi-objective … Cites: ‪Opponent modeling in deep reinforcement learning‬
