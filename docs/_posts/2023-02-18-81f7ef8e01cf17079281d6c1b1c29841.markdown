We propose a novel graph-based approach for semantic parsing that resolves two problems observed in the literature:(1) seq2seq models fail on compositional generalization tasks;(2) previous work using phrase structure parsers cannot cover all the semantic parses observed in treebanks. We prove that both MAP inference and latent tag anchoring (required for weakly-supervised learning) are NP-hard problems. We propose two optimization algorithms based on constraint smoothing  Cites: Span-based semantic parsing for compositional generalization
