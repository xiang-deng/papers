The instruction learning paradigm--where a model learns to perform new tasks from task descriptions alone--has become popular in general-purpose model research. The capabilities of large transformer models as instruction learners, however, remain poorly understood. We use a controlled synthetic environment to characterize such capabilities. Specifically, we use the task of deciding whether a given string matches a regular expression (viewed as an instruction) to identify properties of tasks Cites: Compositional generalization and natural language variation: Can
