This paper focuses on improving the scalability of NN verification through exploring which NN architectures lead to more scalable verification. We propose a general framework for incorporating verification scalability in the training process by identifying NN properties that improve verification and incentivizing these properties through a verification loss. One natural application of our method is robustness verification, especially using tools based on interval analysis, which have shown Cites: Certified defenses against adversarial examples
