An increasing body of literature shows that predicting gene clusters related to human cancer disease using biological networks is significant in bioinformation, it would help to understand disease mechanisms, and benefit the development of diagnostics and therapeutics. However, due to noise and preprocessing of data, a single network or graph generated from one cancer disease is insufficient to cluster genes. As some cancer diseases are correlated with each other in practice, by integrating several Cites: Spectral clustering and transductive learning with multiple views
