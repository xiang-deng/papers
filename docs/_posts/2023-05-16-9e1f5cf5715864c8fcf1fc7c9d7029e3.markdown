Reinforcement learning (RL) mimics how humans and animals interact with the environment. The setting is somewhat idealized because, in actual tasks, other agents in the environment have their own goals and behave adaptively to the ego agent. To thrive in those environments, the agent needs to influence other agents so their actions become more helpful and less harmful. Research in computational economics distills two ways to influence others directly: by providing tangible goods  Cites: The AI Economist: Taxation policy design via two-level deep
