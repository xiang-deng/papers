What are the best methods of capturing thematic similarity between literary texts? Knowing the answer to this question would be useful for automatic clustering of book genres, or any other thematic grouping. This paper compares a variety of algorithms for unsupervised learning of thematic similarities between texts, which we call computational thematics . These algorithms belong to three steps of analysis: text preprocessing, extraction of text features, and measuring distances between the lists Cites: Is automated topic model evaluation broken? the incoherence of
