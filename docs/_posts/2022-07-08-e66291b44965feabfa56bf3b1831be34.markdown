A de novo molecular design workflow can be used together with technologies such as reinforcement learning to navigate the chemical space. A bottleneck in the workflow that remains to be solved is how to integrate human feedback in the exploration of the chemical space to optimize molecules. A human drug designer still needs to design the goal, expressed as a scoring function for the molecules that captures the designer s implicit knowledge about the optimization task. Little support …
