Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have made remarkable progress in table-to-text generation tasks. However, the topological gap between tabular data and text and the lack of domain-specific knowledge make it difficult for PLMs to produce faithful text, especially in real-world applications with limited resources. In this paper, we mitigate the above challenges by introducing a novel augmentation method: Prompt-based Adapter (PA), which targets table-to-text generation under few-shot Cites: Adapterhub: A framework for adapting transformers
