Domain modeling is a central component in education technologies as it represents the target domain students are supposed to train on and eventually master. Automatically generating domain models can lead to substantial cost and scalability benefits. Automatically extracting key concepts or knowledge components from, for instance, textbooks can enable the development of automatic or semi-automatic processes for creating domain models. We explore in this work the use of transformer Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
