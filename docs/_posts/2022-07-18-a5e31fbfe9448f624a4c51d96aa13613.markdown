Antibodies are versatile molecular binders with an established and growing role as therapeutics. Computational approaches to developing and designing these molecules are being increasingly used to complement traditional lab-based processes. Nowadays, in silico methods fill multiple elements of the discovery stage, such as characterizing antibody–antigen interactions and identifying developability liabilities. Recently, computational methods tackling such problems have begun to …
