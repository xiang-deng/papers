Data augmentation effectively alleviates the over-fitting problem in convolutional neural network-based (CNN-based) models, especially in the limited dataset. However, the inconsistency problem between the augmented sample and its original label is still a critical challenge during the augmentation operation. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation scheme named Interpretability-Mask (IM), which exploits the interpretability of the classifier to obtain the most discriminative regions …
