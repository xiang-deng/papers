Link prediction is an important task in social network analysis and mining because of its various applications. A large number of link prediction methods have been proposed. Among them, the deep learning-based embedding methods exhibit excellent performance, which encodes each node and edge as an embedding vector, enabling easy integration with traditional machine learning algorithms. However, there still remain some unsolved problems for this kind of methods Cites: Introduction to Graph Neural Networks
