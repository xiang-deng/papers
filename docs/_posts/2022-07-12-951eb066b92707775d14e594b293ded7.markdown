Multi-task learning (MTL) paradigm focuses on jointly learning two or more tasks, aiming for significant improvement wrt model s generalizability, performance, and training/inference memory footprint. The aforementioned benefits become ever so indispensable in the case of joint training for vision-related {\bf dense} prediction tasks. In this work, we tackle the MTL problem of two dense tasks,\ie, semantic segmentation and depth estimation, and present a novel attention module called …
