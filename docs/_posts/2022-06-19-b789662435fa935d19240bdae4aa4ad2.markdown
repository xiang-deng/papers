With the rapid progress of deep neural models and the explosion of available data resources, dialogue systems that supports extensive topics and chit-chat conversations are emerging as a research hot-spot for many communities, eg, information retrieval (IR), natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (ML). Building a chit-chat system with retrieval techniques is an essential task and has achieved great success in the past few years. The advance of chit-chat systems
