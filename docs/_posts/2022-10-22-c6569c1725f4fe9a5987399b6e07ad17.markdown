With a growing need for robust and general discourse structures in many downstream tasks and real-world applications, the current lack of high-quality, high-quantity discourse trees poses a severe shortcoming. In order the alleviate this limitation, we propose a new strategy to generate tree structures in a task-agnostic, unsupervised fashion by extending a latent tree induction framework with an auto-encoding objective. The proposed approach can be applied to any tree-structured  Cites: Document modeling with gated recurrent neural network for
