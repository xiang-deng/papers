Abstract Knowledge graphs are organized as triplets to represent facts from the real world and play an important role in various intelligent information systems. Because knowledge graphs are frequently constructed using manual or semi-automatic methods, they often miss connections between entities. Link prediction was created to solve this problem. Many recent state-of-the-art studies, such as those introducing the RotatE and RotatHS models, have advocated for rotation transformations with Cites: Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text
