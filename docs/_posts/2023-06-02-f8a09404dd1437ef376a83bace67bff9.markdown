Entity Matching (EM) involves identifying different data representations referring to the same entity from multiple data sources and is typically formulated as a binary classification problem. It is a challenging problem in data integration due to the heterogeneity of data representations. State-of-the-art solutions have adopted NLP techniques based on pre-trained language models (PrLMs) via the fine-tuning paradigm, however, sequential fine-tuning of overparameterized PrLMs can lead to …
