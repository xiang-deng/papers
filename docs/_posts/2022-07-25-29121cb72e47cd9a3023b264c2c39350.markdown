For document analysis, existing methods often resort to the document representation that either discards the word order information or projects each word into a low-dimensional dense embedding vector. However, confined by the data s sparsity and high-dimensionality, limited effort has been made to explore the semantic structures underlying the document representation that formulates each document as a sequence of one-hot vectors, especially in the probabilistic modeling literature.
