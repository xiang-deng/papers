Text detection from natural scene images is an active research area for computer vision, signal, and image processing because of several real-time applications such as driving vehicles automatically and tracing person behaviors during sports or marathon events. In these situations, there is a high probability of missing text information due to the occlusion of different objects/persons while capturing images. Unlike most of the existing methods, which focus only on text detection by ignoring Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
