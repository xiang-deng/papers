The temporal entity alignment task aims to discover entities with the same meaning but belonging to different temporal knowledge graphs (KGs). Most existing entity alignment studies mainly focus on static entity alignment, while temporal entity alignment has not received enough attention. However, entity alignment containing temporal information is more in line with real-world application scenarios, and applying static entity alignment models directly to temporal KGs usually does not Cites: Visual pivoting for (unsupervised) entity alignment
