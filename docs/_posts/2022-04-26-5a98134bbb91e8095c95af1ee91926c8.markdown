Neural passage retrieval is a new and promising approach in open retrieval question answering. In this work, we stress-test the Dense Passage Retriever (DPR)--a state- of-the-art (SOTA) open domain neural retrieval model--on closed and specialized target domains such as COVID-19, and find that it lags behind standard BM25 in this important real-world setting. To make DPR more robust under domain shift, we explore its fine-tuning with synthetic training examples, which we generate from Cites: Rapidly bootstrapping a question answering dataset for COVID-19
