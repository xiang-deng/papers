Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown great potentials in automatically designing neural network architectures for real-time semantic segmentation. Unlike previous works that utilize a simplified search space with cell-sharing way, we introduce a new search space where a lightweight model can be more effectively searched by replacing the cell-sharing manner with cell-independent one. Based on this, the communication of local to global information is achieved through two well  Cites: ESPNetv2: A Light-weight, Power Efficient, and General Purpose
