It is an open question what semantic representations transformer-based language models can encode and whether they have access to more abstract aspects of semantic meaning. Here, we propose a diagnostic dataset to investigate how well language models understand the degree semantics of adjectives. In the dataset, referred as the Adjective Scale Probe (ASP), we semi-automatically generate 8 tests of Natural Language Inference (NLI) questions to test 8 key capabilities of adjective …
