In this chapter, the data-driven RUL prediction methods for mechanical systems are presented. Since the deep learning algorithm has shown remarkbale advantages on prognosis problems in the current literature, the neural network-based methods are focused on in this chapter. First, the deep separable convolutional neural network-based RUL prediction method is introduced, which establishes a direct mapping relationship between raw monitoring data and RUL by implementing separable  Cites: Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for
