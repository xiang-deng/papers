Expanding digital data sources, including social media, online news articles and blogs, provide an opportunity to understand better the context and intensity of human-nature interactions, such as wildlife exploitation. However, online searches encompassing large taxonomic groups can generate vast datasets, which can be overwhelming to filter for relevant content without the use of automated tools. The variety of machine learning models available to researchers, and the need for Cites: Cold-start active learning through self-supervised language
