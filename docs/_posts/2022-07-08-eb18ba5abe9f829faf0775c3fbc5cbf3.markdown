Text-based simulated environments have proven to be a valid testbed for machine learning approaches. The process of affordance extraction can be used to generate possible actions for interaction within such an environment. In this paper the capabilities and challenges for utilizing external knowledge databases (in particular ConceptNet) in the process of affordance extraction are studied. An algorithm for automated affordance extraction is introduced and evaluated on the Interactive Cites: Never-ending learning
