Most existing methods of Out-of-Domain (OOD) intent classification, which rely on extensive auxiliary OOD corpora or specific training paradigms, are underdeveloped in the underlying principle that the models should have differentiated confidence in In-and Out-of-domain intent. In this work, we demonstrate that calibrated subnetworks can be uncovered by pruning the (poor-calibrated) overparameterized model. Calibrated confidence provided by the subnetwork can better distinguish In-and Out Cites: An investigation of why overparameterization exacerbates
