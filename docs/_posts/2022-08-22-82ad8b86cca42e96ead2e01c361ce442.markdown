Truth inference can help solve some difficult problems of data integration in crowdsourcing. Crowdsourced workers are not experts and their labeling ability varies greatly; therefore, in practical applications, it is difficult to determine whether the labels collected from a crowdsourcing platform are correct. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, called truth inference based on label confidence clustering (TILCC), to improve the quality of integrated labels for the single-choice classification Cites: Learning from the Wisdom of Crowds by Minimax Entropy.
