Purpose This paper aims to propose a method for better discovering topic evolution path and semantic relationship from the perspective of patent entity extraction and semantic representation. On the one hand, this paper identifies entities that have the same semantics but different expressions for accurate topic evolution path discovery. On the other hand, this paper reveals semantic relationships of topic evolution for better understanding what leads to topic evolution. Design/methodology/approach …
