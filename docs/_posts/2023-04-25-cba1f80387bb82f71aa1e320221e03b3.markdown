Contrary to data, knowledge is often abstract. Concrete knowledge can be achieved through the inclusion of semantics in the data models, highlighting the role of data integration. The massive growing number of data, in recent years, has promoted the demand for scaling up data management techniques; materializing data integration, aka, knowledge graph creation falls in that category. In this thesis, we investigate efficient methods and techniques for materializing data integration. We formalize the …
