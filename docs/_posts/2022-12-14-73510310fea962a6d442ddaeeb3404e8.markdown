Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) have been rising in popularity in many industrial applications. However, for TKG-based applications to perform accurately, we need to have a reliable temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) model to capture the semantic meanings of entities and the relationship between entities. This is possible when we have many standardised academic TKGs that are well-connected with popular entities. However, in real-world settings, these wellconnected TKGs are …
