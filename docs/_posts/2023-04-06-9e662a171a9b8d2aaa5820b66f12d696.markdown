Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to automatically identify the sentiment polarity of specific aspect words in a given sentence or document. Existing studies have recognised the value of interactive learning in ABSA and have developed various methods to precisely model aspect words and their contexts through interactive learning. However, these methods mostly take a shallow interactive way to model aspect words and their contexts, which may lead to the lack of complex …
