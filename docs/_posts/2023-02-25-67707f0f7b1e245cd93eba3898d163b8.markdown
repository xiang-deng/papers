Gradient-based explanation methods play an important role in the field of interpreting complex deep neural networks for NLP models. However, the existing work has shown that the gradients of a model are unstable and easily manipulable, which impacts the model s reliability largely. According to our preliminary analyses, we also find the interpretability of gradient-based methods is limited for complex tasks, such as aspect-based sentiment classification (ABSC). In this paper, we propose an\textbf  Cites: AllenNLP Interpret: A Framework for Explaining Predictions of NLP
