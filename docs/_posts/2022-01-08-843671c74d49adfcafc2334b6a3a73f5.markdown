We present strong Transformer-based re-ranking and dense retrieval baselines for the recently released TripClick health ad-hoc retrieval collection. We improve the- originally too noisy-training data with a simple negative sampling policy. We achieve large gains over BM25 in the re-ranking task of TripClick, which were not achieved with the original baselines. Furthermore, we study the impact of different domain- specific pre-trained models on TripClick. Finally, we show that dense retrieval Cites: Rapidly bootstrapping a question answering dataset for COVID-19
