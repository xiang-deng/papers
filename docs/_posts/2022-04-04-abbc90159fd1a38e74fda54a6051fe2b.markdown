Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used for decision making, prompting a surge of interest in interpreting how these complex models work. Recent literature on DNN interpretation has revolved around already-trained models; however, much less research focuses on interpreting how the models evolve as they are trained. Interpreting model evolution is crucial to monitor network training and can aid proactive decisions about necessary interventions. In this work, we present Cites:   Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
