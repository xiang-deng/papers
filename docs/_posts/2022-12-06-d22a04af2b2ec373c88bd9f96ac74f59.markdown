This paper presents a solution for the CCKS 2022 NEC Task: Financial Event Extraction. What is challenging in this task is detecting semantically ambiguous and complex event in short and low-context settings. Our team (CMB AI Lab) propose a ner method for event extraction: first, the dataset is split by the cause-and-effect list, and then a model based on biaffine layer/global pointer is built to predict span boundaries of specific category. The basic pre-trained models we choose are …
