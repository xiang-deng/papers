In this short paper, we describe a new model for learning content-based tweet embeddings that serve to be generically useful as signals for a variety of down-stream predictive tasks. In contrast to prior approaches that only leverage cues from the raw text, we take a holistic approach and propose Twice, a model for learning tweet embeddings that (a) leverages cues beyond the raw text (including media) and (b) attempts to yield representations optimized for overall similarity, a combination of Cites: Whiteningbert: An easy unsupervised sentence embedding
