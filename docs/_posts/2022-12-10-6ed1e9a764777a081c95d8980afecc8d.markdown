Actions play a vital role in how humans interact with the world. Thus, autonomous agents that would assist us in everyday tasks also require the capability to perform Reasoning about Actions & Change (RAC). Recently, there has been growing interest in the study of RAC with visual and linguistic inputs. Graphs are often used to represent semantic structure of the visual content (ie objects, their attributes and relationships among objects), commonly referred to as scene-graphs Cites: Alfred: A benchmark for interpreting grounded instructions for
