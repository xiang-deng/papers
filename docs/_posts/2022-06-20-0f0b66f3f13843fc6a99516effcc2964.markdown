Tensors or multi-way arrays are useful tools to identify unknown quantities thanks to the uniqueness of their decomposition. Tensor decompositions have been widely applied to obtain unknown components with physical meanings in many applications such as medical image and signal processing, hyperspectral images analysis, chemometrics, etc. In this thesis, we investigate the application of tensor decomposition for probability estimations, which are required for some targeted …
