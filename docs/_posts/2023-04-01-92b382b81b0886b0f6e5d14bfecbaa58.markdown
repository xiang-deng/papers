The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is a declarative language that adds constraints and object query expressions to MOF models. Despite its potential to provide precision and conciseness to UML models, the unfamiliar syntax of OCL has hindered its adoption. Recent advancements in LLMs, such as GPT-3, have shown their capability in many NLP tasks, including semantic parsing and text generation. Codex, a GPT-3 descendant, has been fine-tuned on publicly available code from …
