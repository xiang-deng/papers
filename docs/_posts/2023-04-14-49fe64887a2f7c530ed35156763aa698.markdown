Large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity in various fields for their exceptional capability of generating human-like text. Their potential misuse has raised social concerns about plagiarism in academic contexts. However, effective artificial scientific text detection is a non-trivial task due to several challenges, including 1) the lack of a clear understanding of the differences between machine-generated and human-written scientific text, 2) the poor generalization performance  Cites: Is GPT-3 text indistinguishable from human text? scarecrow: A
