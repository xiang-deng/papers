This study presents an efficient framework of deriving lemma from an inflected Bangla word considering its parts-of-speech as context. Bangla is a morphologically rich Indo-Aryan language where around 70% words are inflected, and some words have around 90 different inflected forms making it one of the most challenging languages for lemmatization. The unavailability of a sufficiently large appropriate dataset in Bangla makes the task even more strenuous.
