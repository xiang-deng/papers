The analysis and design of materials is often a slow process that may take weeks, months, or years. And, many current material platforms rely on expensive raw material sources and fail to achieve sustainability goals. Meanwhile, bio-inspired Materials Informaticsfueled by emerging techniques such as multiscale modeling, machine learning and autonomous experimentationis transforming the way materials are understood, discovered, developed, and selected.
