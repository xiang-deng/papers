Lots of researchers have studied for classifying histopathological whole slide images (WSIs). Since a WSI is too large to be processed directly, researchers usually cut it into many small-sized patches and then integrate the discriminative features extracted from the patches to obtain a slide-level feature of the WSI. The integration strategy generating the slide-level features is crucial for the WSI classification model. Lots of attention-based methods have been proposed for such purpose. However …
