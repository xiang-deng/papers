Federated Learning is a distributed machine learning approach that enables geographically distributed data silos to collaboratively learn a joint machine learning model without sharing data. Most of the existing work operates on unstructured data, such as images or text, or on structured data assumed to be consistent across the different sites. However, sites often have different schemata, data formats, data values, and access patterns. The field of data integration has developed many …
