Free-text rationales aim to explain neural language model (LM) behavior more flexibly and intuitively via natural language. To ensure rationale quality, it is important to have metrics for measuring rationales faithfulness (reflects LM s actual behavior) and plausibility (convincing to humans). All existing free-text rationale metrics are based on simulatability (association between rationale and LM s predicted label), but there is no protocol for assessing such metrics reliability. To investigate this, we Cites: ERASER: A benchmark to evaluate rationalized NLP models
