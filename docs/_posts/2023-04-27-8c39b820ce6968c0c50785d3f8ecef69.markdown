A network-based optimization approach, EEE, is proposed for the purpose of providing validation-viable state estimations to remediate the failure of pretrained models. To improve optimization efficiency and convergence, the most important metrics in the context of this research, we follow a three-faceted approach based on the error from the validation process. Firstly, we improve the information content of the error by designing a validation module to acquire high-dimensional error  Cites: Chi, Quoc Le, and Denny Zhou
