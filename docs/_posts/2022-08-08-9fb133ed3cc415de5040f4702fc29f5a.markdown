Fabric defect detection is the important step of ensuring the quality and price of textiles. In order to make the automatic fabric defect detection system used in production sites, a cloudedge collaborative fabric defect system is proposed. Firstly, real-time defect detection is performed on edge device, the accuracy of small defect detection is ensured by improved MobileNetV2-SSDLite. The channel attention mechanism is introduced in the network to highlight defect features and suppress Cites: Searching for mobilenetv3
