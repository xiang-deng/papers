Network structure provides critical information for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems. However, the complete structure of real-world networks is often unavailable, thus it is crucially important to develop approaches to infer a more complete structure of networks. In this paper, we integrate the configuration model for generating random networks into an ExpectationMaximizationAggregation (EMA) framework to reconstruct the complete structure of  Cites: Complex embeddings for simple link prediction
