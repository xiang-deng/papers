Morphological segmentation is a basic task in agglutinative language information processing, dividing words into the smallest semantic unit morphemes. There are two types of morphological segmentation: canonical segmentation and surface segmentation. As a typical agglutinative language, Uyghur usually uses statistical-based methods in canonical segmentation, which relies on the artificial extraction of features. In surface segmentation, the artificial feature extraction process is avoided  Cites: Neural machine translation with a polysynthetic low resource
