In this paper, we extend scene understanding to include that of human sketch. The result is a complete trilogy of scene representation from three diverse and complementary modalities--sketch, photo, and text. Instead of learning a rigid three-way embedding and be done with it, we focus on learning a flexible joint embedding that fully supports the  optionality  that this complementarity brings. Our embedding supports optionality on two axis:(i) optionality across modalities--use any …
