We develop a novel credit assignment algorithm for information processing with spiking neurons without requiring feedback synapses. Specifically, we propose an event-driven generalization of the forward-forward and the predictive forward-forward learning processes for a spiking neural system that iteratively processes sensory input over a stimulus window. As a result, the recurrent circuit computes the membrane potential of each neuron in each layer as a function of local bottom-up …
