In this paper we introduce Federated Learning Utilities and Tools for Experimentation (FLUTE), a high-performance open source platform for federated learning research and offline simulations. The goal of FLUTE is to enable rapid prototyping and simulation of new federated learning algorithms at scale, including novel optimization, privacy, and communications strategies. We describe the architecture of FLUTE, enabling arbitrary federated modeling schemes to be Cites: Generating representative headlines for news stories
