The $\texttt {torch-choice} $ is an open-source library for flexible, fast choice modeling with Python and PyTorch. $\texttt {torch-choice} $ provides a $\texttt {ChoiceDataset} $ data structure to manage databases flexibly and memory-efficiently. The paper demonstrates constructing a $\texttt {ChoiceDataset} $ from databases of various formats and functionalities of $\texttt {ChoiceDataset} $. The package implements two widely used models, namely the multinomial logit and Cites: Partitioned logistic regression for spam filtering
