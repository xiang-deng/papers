Our goal is to control text generation with more fine-grained conditions at lower computational cost than is possible with current alternatives; these conditions are attributes (ie, multiple codes and free-text). As large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) offer excellent performance in free-form text generation, we explore efficient architectures and training schemes that can best leverage PLMs. Our framework, Friendly Conditional Text Generator (FCTG), introduces a multi-view …
