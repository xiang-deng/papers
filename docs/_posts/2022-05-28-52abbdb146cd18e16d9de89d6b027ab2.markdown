In recent years, underground forums have played a more significant role in trading illicit crimeware and disseminating crime services. To combat its imperils to our cybersecurity, in this thesis, we develop an intelligent framework to identify the key players on Hack Forums to better monitor and trace the distribution of crimeware on the market. We first introduce a heterogeneous information network to model the intricate ecosystem based on the extracted entity and relations. Then we propose a  Cites: Tools for Automated Analysis of Cybercriminal Markets
