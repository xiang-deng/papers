Automatic source-to-source parallelization of serial code for shared and distributed memory systems is a challenging task in high-performance computing. While many attempts were made to translate serial code into parallel code for a shared memory environment (usually using OpenMP), none has managed to do so for a distributed memory environment. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called MPI-rical, for automated MPI code generation using a transformer-based model trained on Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
