Tabular data is the foundation of the information age and has been extensively studied. Recent studies show that neural-based models are effective in learning contextual representation for tabular data. The learning of an effective contextual representation requires meaningful features and a large amount of data. However, current methods often fail to properly learn a contextual representation from the features without semantic information. In addition, it s intractable to enlarge the  Cites: TaBERT: Pretraining for joint understanding of textual and tabular
