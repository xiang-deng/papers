Hash is one of the most widely used methods for computing efficiency and storage efficiency. With the development of deep learning, the deep hash method shows more advantages than traditional methods. This paper proposes a method to convert entities with attribute information into embedded vectors (FPHD). The design uses the hash method to quickly extract entity features, and uses a deep neural network to learn the implicit association between entity features. This design solves two main …
