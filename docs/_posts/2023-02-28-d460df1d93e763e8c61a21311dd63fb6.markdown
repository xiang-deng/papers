In federated learning (FL), in addition to the training and speculating capacities of the global and local models, an appropriately annotated dataset is equally crucial. These datasets rely on annotation procedures that are error prone and laborious, which require personal inspection for training the overall dataset. In this study, we evaluate the effect of unlabeled data supplied by every participating node in active learning (AL) on the FL. We propose an AL-empowered FL paradigm that combines two Cites: Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for
