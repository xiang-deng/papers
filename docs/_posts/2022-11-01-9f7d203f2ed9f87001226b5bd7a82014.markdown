Binary code similarity is the foundation of many security and software engineering applications. Recent works leverage deep neural networks (DNN) to learn a numeric vector representation (namely embeddings) of assembly functions, enabling similarity analysis in the numeric space. However, existing DNN-based techniques capture syntactic-, control flow-, or data flow-level information of assembly code, which is too coarse-grained to represent program functionality. These methods can Cites: Jingfei Du, Mandar Joshi, Danqi Chen, Omer Levy, Mike Lewis
