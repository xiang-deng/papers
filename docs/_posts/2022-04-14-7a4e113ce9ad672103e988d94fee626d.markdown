Text authentication serves a vital role in the defense of digital identity and content against various types of cybercrime. The use of a digital signature is a common cryptographic technique for text authentication.

However, steganographic distortion lurking in the text, albeit almost imperceptible, has the potential to cause automatic computing machinery to Cites: Detecting formal thought disorder by deep contextualized word
