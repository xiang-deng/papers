With the advent of deep learning methods, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems have become increasingly powerful. However, deep learning based systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible changes to the input can cause undesirable changes at the output of the system. To date there has been little work investigating adversarial attacks on sequence-to-sequence systems, such as NMT models. Previous work in NMT has examined attacks with the aim of Cites: On Evaluation of Adversarial Perturbations for Sequence-to
