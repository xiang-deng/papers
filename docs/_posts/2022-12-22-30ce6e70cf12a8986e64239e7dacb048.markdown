Incorporating contrastive learning objectives in sentence representation learning (SRL) has yielded significant improvements on many sentence-level NLP tasks. However, It is not well understood why contrastive learning works for learning sentence-level semantics. In this paper, we take a closer look at contrastive sentence representation learning through the lens of isotropy and learning dynamics. We interpret its success stories through the geometry of the representation shifts. We  Cites: Whiteningbert: An easy unsupervised sentence embedding
