Personalization in Information Retrieval has been a hot topic in both academia and industry for the past two decades. However, there is still a lack of high-quality standard benchmark datasets for conducting offline comparative evaluations in this context. To mitigate this problem, in the past few years, approaches to derive synthetic datasets suited for evaluating Personalized Search models have been proposed. In this paper, we put forward a novel evaluation benchmark for  Cites: Latent Retrieval for Weakly Supervised Open Domain Question
