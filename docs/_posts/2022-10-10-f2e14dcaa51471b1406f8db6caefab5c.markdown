Zero-shot relation extraction is an important method for dealing with the newly emerging relations in the real world which lacks labeled data. However, the mainstream two-tower zero-shot methods usually rely on large-scale and in-domain labeled data of predefined relations. In this work, we view zero-shot relation extraction as a semantic matching task optimized by prompt-tuning, which still maintains superior generalization performance when the labeled data of predefined …
