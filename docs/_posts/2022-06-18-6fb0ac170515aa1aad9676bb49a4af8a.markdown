Abstract Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification (ABSA), predicting the sentimental tendency towards given aspects, is an important branch in natural language understanding. However, in the existing deep learning models for ABSA, there is a contradiction between the fine sentiment analysis and the small amount of corpus. To solve this contradiction, we propose a BERT-based Multi-Semantic Learning (BERT-MSL) model with aspect-aware enhancement for aspect polarity classification, which
