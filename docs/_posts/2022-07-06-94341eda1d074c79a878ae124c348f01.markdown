While deep learning (DL) is data-hungry and usually relies on large labeled data to deliver good performance, Active Learning (AL) reduces labeling cost by selecting a small proportion of samples from unlabeled data for labeling and then training. Therefore, in recent years, Deep Active Learning (DAL) has risen as a feasible solution for maximizing model performance under limited labeling cost/budget. Although abundant methods of DAL have been developed and various literature
