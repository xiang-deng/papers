Although contemporary neural models excel in a surprisingly diverse range of application domains, they struggle to capture several key qualities of human cognition that are considered crucial for human-level artificial intelligence (AI). Some of these qualities, such as compositionality and interpretability, are readily achieved with traditional symbolic programming, leading some researchers to suggest hybrid neuro-symbolic programming as a viable route to human-level AI. However, the  Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
