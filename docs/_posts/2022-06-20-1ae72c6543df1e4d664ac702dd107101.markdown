This paper presents a Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network and Hidden Markov Model (LSTM-HMM) to predict China s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) fluctuation state within a rolling time window. We compare the predictive power of LSTM-HMM with other dynamic forecast systems within different time windows, which involves the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden Markov Model (GMM-HMM) and LSTM-HMM with an input of monthly …
