Embodied artificially intelligent agents teaming with humans in industrial environments must be safe and trustworthy, their behaviour predictable, and their rationale explainable. In addressing these extremely wide requirements, we take the knowledge representation angle. Adopting Grdenfors s Conceptual Space framework, learnt concepts are represented as regions across inherently interpretable quality dimensions, while classification of instances proceeds using a Cites: " Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any
