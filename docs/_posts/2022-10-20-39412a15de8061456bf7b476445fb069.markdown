Digraph Representation Learning (DRL) aims to learn representations for directed homogeneous graphs (digraphs). Prior work in DRL is largely constrained (eg, limited to directed acyclic graphs), or has poor generalizability across tasks (eg, evaluated solely on one task). Most G raph N eural N etworks (GNN s) exhibit poor performance on digraphs due to the neglect of modeling neighborhoods and preserving asymmetry. In this paper, we address these notable challenges by  Cites: Fully Hyperbolic Neural Networks
