Genetic programming has been successfully used to evolve routing policies that can make real-time routing decisions for uncertain arc routing problems. Although the evolved routing policies are highly effective, they are typically very large and complex, and hard to be understood and trusted by real users. Existing studies have attempted to improve the interpretability by developing new genetic programming approaches to evolve both effective and interpretable (eg, with smaller program size)  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
