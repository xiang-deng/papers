The aspect-level sentiment analysis is widely used in public opinion analysis. However, the problem of context information loss and distortion with the increase of the model depth is rarely considered in previous research. Few studies have attempted to combine the feature extracted from different embedding models. Based on the correction strategy, the ensemble correction (EC) model proposed in this study can correct context information loss and distortion.
