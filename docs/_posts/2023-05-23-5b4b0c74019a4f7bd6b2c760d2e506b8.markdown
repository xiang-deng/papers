Recently, the new paradigm “pre-train, prompt, and predict” has achieved remarkable few-shot learning achievements compared with the “pre-train, fine-tune” paradigm. Prompt-tuning inserts the prompt text into the input and converts the classification task into a masked language modeling task. One of the key steps is to build a projection between the labels and the label words, ie, the verbalizer. Knowledgeable prompt-tuning (KPT), which integrates external knowledge into the …
