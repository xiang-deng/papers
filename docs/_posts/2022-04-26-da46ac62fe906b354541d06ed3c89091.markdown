Kidney pathophysiology is often complex, nonlinear and heterogeneous, which limits the utility of hypothetical-deductive reasoning and linear, statistical approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that artificial intelligence (AI)- enabled decision support systemswhich use algorithms based on learned examplesmay have an important role in nephrology. Contemporary AI applications can accurately predict the onset of acute kidney injury before notable biochemical Cites: Deep learning-enabled medical computer vision
