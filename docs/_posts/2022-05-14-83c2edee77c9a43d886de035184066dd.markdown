In recent time, lexicon-based LSTM and pre-training language models are combined to explore the Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER) and achieve the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several Chinese benchmark datasets. However, existing lexicon-based models only conform lexicon features through shallow and randomly initialized coding layers and do not integrate them into the bottom layer of the pre-training language model to mine the deep lexicon knowledge Cites: A structural probe for finding syntax in word representations
