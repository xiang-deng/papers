Entity resolution, accurately identifying various representations of the same real-world entities, is a crucial part of data integration systems. While existing learning-based models can achieve good performance, the models are extremely dependent on the quantity and quality of training data. In this paper, the MixER model is proposed to alleviate these problems. The MixER utilizes our newly designed data augmentation method called EMix. The EMix can map discrete entity records to …
