Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based self-supervised visual representation learning (SSL) is a long-standing problem achieving significant successes with traditional handcrafted pretext tasks and contrastive learning. However, existing SSL methods typically suffer from high computational overhead and poor performance due to sluggish convergence speeds and poor detail extraction capabilities. In this work, to address these issues and improve the robustness, we provide a new self Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
