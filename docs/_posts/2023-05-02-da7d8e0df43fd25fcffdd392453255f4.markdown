Numerous visio-linguistic (V+ L) representation learning methods have been developed, yet existing datasets do not adequately evaluate the extent to which they represent visual and linguistic concepts in a unified space. We propose several novel evaluation settings for V+ L models, including cross-modal transfer. Furthermore, existing V+ L benchmarks often report global accuracy scores on the entire dataset, making it difficult to pinpoint the specific reasoning tasks that models  Cites: Jingfei Du, Mandar Joshi, Danqi Chen, Omer Levy, Mike Lewis
