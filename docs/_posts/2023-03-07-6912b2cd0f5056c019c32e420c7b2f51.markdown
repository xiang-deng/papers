Conversational search supports multi-turn user-system interactions to solve complex information needs. Compared with the traditional single-turn ad-hoc search, conversational search faces a more complex search intent understanding problem because a conversational search session is much longer and contains many noisy tokens. However, existing conversational dense retrieval solutions simply fine-tune the pre-trained ad-hoc query encoder on limited conversational search data, which Cites: Few-shot conversational dense retrieval
