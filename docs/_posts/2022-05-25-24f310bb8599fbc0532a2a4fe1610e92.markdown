How can an end-user provide feedback if a deployed structured prediction model generates incorrect output? Our goal is to allow users to correct errors directly through interaction, without retraining, by giving feedback on the model s output. We create a dynamic memory architecture with a growing memory of feedbacks about errors in the output. Given a new, unseen input, our model can use feedback from a similar, past erroneous state. On a script generation task, we show empirically that … Cites: ‪REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training‬
