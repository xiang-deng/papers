From high-resolution images to get context information remains a challenge in real-time semantic segmentation. Despite recent advances in context information acquisition based on Self-Attention, the Self-Attention module will cause the calculation degree to increase exponentially when facing the semantic segmentation task. In this article, we propose a real-time semantic segmentation network (LSNet) which strikes a balance between segmentation accuracy and inference speed Cites: Random feature attention
