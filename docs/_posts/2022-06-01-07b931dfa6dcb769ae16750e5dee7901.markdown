Recently, as an effective way of learning latent representations, contrastive learning has been increasingly popular and successful in various domains. The success of constrastive learning in single-label classifications motivates us to leverage this learning framework to enhance distinctiveness for better performance in multi-label image classification. In this paper, we show that a direct application of contrastive learning can hardly improve in multi-label cases. Accordingly, we propose a novel … Cites: ‪Randaugment: Practical automated data augmentation with a …‬
