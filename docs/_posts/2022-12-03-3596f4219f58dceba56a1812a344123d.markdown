Neural algorithmic reasoning studies the problem of learning algorithms with neural networks, especially with graph architectures. A recent proposal, XLVIN, reaps the benefits of using a graph neural network that simulates the value iteration algorithm in deep reinforcement learning agents. It allows model-free planning without access to privileged information about the environment, which is usually unavailable. However, XLVIN only supports discrete action spaces, and is hence nontrivially  Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
