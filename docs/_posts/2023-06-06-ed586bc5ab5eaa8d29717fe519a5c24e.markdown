Abstract Machine translation is an important and challenging task that aims at automatically translating natural language sentences from one language into another. Recently, Transformer-based neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved great break-throughs and has become a new mainstream method in both methodology and applications. In this article, we conduct an overview of Transformer-based NMT and its extension to other tasks. Specifically, we first introduce the …
