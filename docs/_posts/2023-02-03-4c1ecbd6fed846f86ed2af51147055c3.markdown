Few-shot relation classification (FSRC) focuses on recognizing novel relations by learning with merely a handful of annotated instances. Meta-learning has been widely adopted for such a task, which trains on randomly generated few-shot tasks to learn generic data representations. Despite impressive results achieved, existing models still perform suboptimally when handling hard FSRC tasks with similar categories that confuse the model to distinguish correctly. We argue this is largely …
