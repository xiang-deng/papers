Code-generating large language models translate natural language into code. However, only a small portion of the infinite space of naturalistic utterances is effective at guiding code generation. For non-expert end-user programmers, learning this is the challenge of abstraction matching. We examine this challenge in the specific context of data analysis in spreadsheets, in a system that maps the users natural language query to Python code using the Codex generator, executes the  Cites: Reframing Instructional Prompts to GPTk s Language
