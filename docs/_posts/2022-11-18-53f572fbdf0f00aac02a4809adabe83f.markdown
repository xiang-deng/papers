Natural language inference, also known as NLI, aims to determine the logical relationship between two sentences, such as Entailment, Contradiction, and Neutral. NLI is important to natural language processing, because it involves logical reasoning and is a key problem in artificial intelligence. In recent years, deep learning models have become a prevailing approach to NLI. Those approaches can achieve high performance, but lack interpretability and explainability. In this work, we …
