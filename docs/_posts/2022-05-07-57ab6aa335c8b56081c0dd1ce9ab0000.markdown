Rolling bearing is a key component of rotating machines, its working state directly affects the performance and safety of the whole equipment. Deep learning based on big data is a mainstream means of intelligent mechanical fault diagnosis. The key lies in enhancing fault feature and improving diagnosis accuracy. Different from the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) which relies on the convolution layer to extract the image features, the Vision Transformer (VIT) uses the multi-head attention Cites: BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
