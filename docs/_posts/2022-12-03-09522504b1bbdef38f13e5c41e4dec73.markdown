Due to the closed working environment of shield machines, the construction personnel cannot observe the construction geological environment, which seriously restricts the safety and efficiency of the tunneling process. In this study, we present an enhanced multi-head self-attention convolution neural network (EMSACNN) with two-stage feature extraction for geological condition prediction of shield machine. Firstly, we select 30 important parameters according to statistical analysis method  Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
