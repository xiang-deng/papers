Extracting relational triplets aims at detecting entity pairs and their semantic relations. Compared with pipeline models, joint models can reduce error propagation and achieve better performance. However, all of these models require large amounts of training data, therefore performing poorly on many long-tail relations in reality with insufficient data. In this article, we propose a novel end-to-end model, called TGIN, for few-shot triplet extraction. The core of TGIN is a multilayer heterogeneous graph …
