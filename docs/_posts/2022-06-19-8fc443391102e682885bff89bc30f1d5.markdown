While the application of differential privacy (DP) has been well-studied in cross-device federated learning (FL), there is a lack of work considering DP for cross-silo FL, a setting characterized by a limited number of clients each containing many data subjects. In cross-silo FL, usual notions of client-level privacy are less suitable as real-world privacy regulations typically concern in-silo data subjects rather than the silos themselves. In this work, we instead consider the more realistic notion of silo Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
