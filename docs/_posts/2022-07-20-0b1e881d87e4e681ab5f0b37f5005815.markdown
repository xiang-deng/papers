These EIs are not only increasing in number, but also in complexity and diversity, making it hard to understand this evaluation landscape in a meaningful way. In this paper we present an approach for categorising EIs using a set of 18 facets, accompanied by a rubric to  Cites: On the opportunities and risks of foundation models
