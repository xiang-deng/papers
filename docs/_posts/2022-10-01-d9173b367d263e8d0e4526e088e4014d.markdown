Authorship attribution is the task of identifying the author of a given text. Most existing approaches use manually designed features that capture a dataset s content and style. However, this dataset-dependent approach yields inconsistent performance. Thus, we propose to fine-tune pre-trained language representations using a combination of contrastive learning and supervised learning (Contra-X). We show that Contra-X advances the state-of-the-art on multiple human and machine Cites: SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings
