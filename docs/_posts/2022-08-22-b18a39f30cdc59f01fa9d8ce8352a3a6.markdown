Task fMRI provides an opportunity to analyze the working mechanisms of the human brain during specific experimental paradigms. Deep learning models have increasingly been applied for decoding and encoding purposes study to representations in task fMRI data. More recently, graph neural networks, or neural networks models designed to leverage the properties of graph representations, have recently shown promise in task fMRI decoding studies. Here, we propose an end-to Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
