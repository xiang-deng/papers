Remote sensing visual question answering (RSVQA) was recently proposed with the aim of interfacing natural language and vision to ease the access of information contained in Earth Observation data for a wide audience, which is granted by simple questions in natural language. The traditional vision/language interface is an embedding obtained by fusing features from two deep models, one processing the image and another the question. Despite the success of early VQA models, it …
