Due to the development of pre-trained language models, automated code generation techniques have shown great promise in recent years. However, the generated code is difficult to meet the syntactic constraints of the target language, especially in the case of Turducken-style code, where declarative code snippets are embedded within imperative programs. In this study, we summarize the lack of syntactic constraints into three significant challenges:(1) the efficient representation of syntactic constraints,(2)  Cites: Ppt: Pre-trained prompt tuning for few-shot learning
