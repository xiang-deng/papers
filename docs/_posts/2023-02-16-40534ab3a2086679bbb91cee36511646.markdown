This survey documents representation approaches for classification across different modalities, from purely content-based methods to techniques utilizing external sources of structured knowledge. We present studies related to three paradigms used for representation, namely a) low-level template-matching methods, b) aggregation-based approaches and c) deep representation learning systems. We then describe existing resources of structure knowledge and elaborate on the need Cites: Knowledge enhanced contextual word representations
