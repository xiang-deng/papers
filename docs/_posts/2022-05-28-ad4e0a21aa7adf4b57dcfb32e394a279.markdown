Network alignment is a fundamental task in network analysis. In the biological field, where the protein–protein interaction (PPI) is represented as a graph, network alignment allowed the discovery of underlying biological knowledge such as conserved evolutionary pathways and functionally conserved proteins throughout different species. A recent trend in network science concerns network embedding, ie, the modelling of nodes in a network as a low-dimensional feature vector.
