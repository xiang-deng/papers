Graph convolutional network-based methods have become mainstream for cross-language entity alignment. The graph convolutional network has multi-order characteristics that not only process data more conveniently but also reduce the interference of noise effectively. Although the existing methods have achieved good results for the task of cross-language entity alignment, they have often overlooked the same entity names in the real corpus, resulting in an entity-matching result that …
