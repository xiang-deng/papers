Contextual ranking models have delivered impressive performance improvements over classical models in the document ranking task. However, these highly over-parameterized models tend to be data-hungry and require large amounts of data even for fine tuning. This paper proposes a simple yet effective method to improve ranking performance on smaller datasets using supervised contrastive learning for the document ranking problem. We perform data augmentation by creating training …
