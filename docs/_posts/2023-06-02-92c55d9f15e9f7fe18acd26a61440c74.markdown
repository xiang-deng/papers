Understanding black-box Machine Learning methods on multidimensional data is a key challenge in Machine Learning. While many powerful Machine Learning methods already exist, these methods are often unexplainable or perform poorly on complex data. This paper proposes visual knowledge discovery approaches based on several forms of lossless General Line Coordinates. These are an expansion of the previously introduced General Line Coordinates Linear and Dynamic Scaffolding Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
