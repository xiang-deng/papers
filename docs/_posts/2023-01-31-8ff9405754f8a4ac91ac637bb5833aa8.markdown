We have seen complex deep learning models out-performing human benchmarks in many areas (eg computer vision, natural language processing). Clever architectures and higher model complexity are two of the major drivers of such outstanding performances. Higher model complexity generally makes the decision-making process of a model opaque to human perception. But understanding the decision-making process is very important for many reasons including enhancing trust in the …
