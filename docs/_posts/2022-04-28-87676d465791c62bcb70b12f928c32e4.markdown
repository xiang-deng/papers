The non-autoregressive decoders in neural machine translation are paid increasing attention due to their faster decoding than autoregressive decoders. However, their apparent problem is a low performance which is mainly originated from wrong prediction about the target sentence length. To attack this problem, this paper proposes a novel machine translation model with a new non-autoregressive decoder named Iterative and Length-Adjustive Non-Autoregressive Decoder (ILAND).
