This paper presents a novel spatio-temporal LSTM (SPATIAL) architecture for time series forecasting applied to environmental datasets. The framework was applied for three different ocean datasets: current speed, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. Network implementation proceeded in two directions that are nominally separated but connected as part of a natural environmental system–across the spatial (between individual sensors) and temporal dimensions of the sensor data.
