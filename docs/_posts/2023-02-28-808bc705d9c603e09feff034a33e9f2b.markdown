Knowledge graphs are a popular research field in artificial intelligence, and store large amounts of real-world data. Since data are enriched over time, the knowledge graph is often incomplete. Therefore, knowledge graph completion is particularly important as it predicts missing links based on existing facts. Currently, the family of translation models delivers a better performance in knowledge graph completion. However, most of these models randomly generate negative triplets during the  Cites: Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text
