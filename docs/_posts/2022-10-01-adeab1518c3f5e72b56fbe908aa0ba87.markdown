End-to-end neural NLP architectures are notoriously difficult to understand, which gives rise to numerous efforts towards model explainability in recent years. An essential principle of model explanation is Faithfulness, ie, an explanation should accurately represent the reasoning process behind the model s prediction. This survey first discusses the definition and evaluation of Faithfulness, as well as its significance for explainability. We then introduce the recent advances in faithful Cites: Latent compositional representations improve systematic
