In recent years, Knowledge Graph (KG) development has attracted significant researches considering the applications in web search, relation prediction, natural language processing, information retrieval, question answering to name a few. However, often KGs are incomplete due to which Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) has emerged as a sub-domain of research to automatically track down the missing connections in a KG. Numerous strategies have been suggested to work out Cites: Semantic parsing on freebase from question-answer pairs
