Traffic accidents caused by distracted driving are on the rise, posing a serious threat to the safety of people s lives and property. Recognition and early warning of the driver s actions is particularly important. Considering the differences in local details of driver actions, we use the keypoint information of drivers that reflects the category differences. Specifically, we explicitly model keypoints features and propose a pose-aware driver action recognition model. We design a pose-based feature fusion … Cites: ‪Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database‬
