Huge-scale knowledge graphs have become widespread on the web and are useful for a plethora of tasks. Knowledge graphs which are powered by machine learning use Natural Language Processing to build an extensive view of nodes, edges and labels by semantic enrichment in order to automate tasks like data structuring, text analysis and merging of data models. This research study put forth a semantically-driven and knowledge-centric strategy, which integrates machine learning and  Cites: Text generation from knowledge graphs with graph transformers
