While most machine learning models can provide confidence in their predictions, confidence is insufficient to understand a prediction s reliability. For instance, the model may have a low confidence prediction if the input is not well-represented in the training dataset or if the input is inherently ambiguous. In this work, we investigate the relationship between how atypical (rare) a sample or a class is and the reliability of a model s predictions. We first demonstrate that atypicality is strongly Cites: Demystifying prompts in language models via perplexity estimation
