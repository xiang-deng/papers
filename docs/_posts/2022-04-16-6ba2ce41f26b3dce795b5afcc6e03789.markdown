This manuscript discusses the robustness to noise of deep learning models for two audio classification tasks. The first task is a speaker recognition application, trying to identify five different speakers. The second one is a speech command identification where the goal is to classify ten voice commands. These two tasks are very important to make the communication between humans and smart devices as smooth and natural as possible.
