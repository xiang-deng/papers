Dispersion is accepted as a fundamental step required for analyzing broadband light. The recognition of color by the human eye, its digital reproduction by a camera, or detailed analysis by a spectrometer utilize dispersion; it is also an inherent component of color detection and machine vision. The central thesis of this dissertation is that dispersion is not a prerequisite for a machine to recognize color. The research pursued in this dissertation establishes this novel idea beyond Cites: Deep learning-enabled medical computer vision
