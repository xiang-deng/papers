The Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC), a neural network model with an addressable external memory, can solve algorithmic and question answering tasks. As improved versions of DNC, rsDNC and DNC-DMS have been proposed. However, how to integrate structured knowledge into these DNC models remains a challenging research question. We incorporate an architecture for knowledge into such DNC models, ie DNC, rsDNC and DNC-DMS, to improve the ability to generate …
