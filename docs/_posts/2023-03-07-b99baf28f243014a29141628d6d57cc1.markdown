Many heterogeneous information network (HIN)-based recommendation methods leverage the semantic and structural features of metapath to improve the recommendation performance. However, the existing HIN-based recommendation methods using metapath still suffer from two challenges:(1) HINs in industrial recommendation scenarios usually have a very large scale and contain much redundant or noisy structural information, which may damage the efficiency and Cites: Recommender systems with social regularization
