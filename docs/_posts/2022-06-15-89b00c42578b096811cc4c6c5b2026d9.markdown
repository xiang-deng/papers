Software verification is the task of proving correct-ness of programs against specified requirements. Key to software verification is the automatic generation of loop invariants. In recent years, template-and logic-based approaches to invariant generation have been complemented by machine learning (ML) techniques. A number of proposals for such techniques exist today. Although all authors perform experimental evaluations of their proposals, comparability of the core techniques is  Cites: Learning invariants using decision trees and implication
