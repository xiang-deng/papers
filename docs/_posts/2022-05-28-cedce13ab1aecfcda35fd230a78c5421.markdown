Modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) models based on Transformer structures represent the state of the art in terms of performance on very diverse tasks. However, these models are complex and represent several hundred million parameters for the smallest of them. This may hinder their adoption at the industrial level, making it difficult to scale up to a reasonable infrastructure and/or to comply with societal and environmental responsibilities. To this end, we present in this paper … Cites: ‪Mobilebert: Task-agnostic compression of bert by progressive …‬
