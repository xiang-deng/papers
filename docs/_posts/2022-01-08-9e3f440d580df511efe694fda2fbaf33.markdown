During the decades of development of artificial intelligence, a spectrum of applications involving image, speech, text data, etc. are successfully powered by machine learning. The advantages are mainly derived from the learning ability from data, which most traditional databases lack. Recent years have seen a surge in approaches that explore artificial intelligence to power traditional databases, ie learnable databases, making databases more adaptive and intelligent.
