The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the training dataset setup. In particular, when attributes having a strong correlation with the target attribute are present, the trained model can provide unintended prejudgments and show significant inference errors (ie, the dataset bias problem). Various methods have been proposed to mitigate dataset bias, and their emphasis is on weakly correlated samples, called bias-conflicting samples. These methods are based on  Cites: Catastrophic fisher explosion: Early phase fisher matrix impacts
