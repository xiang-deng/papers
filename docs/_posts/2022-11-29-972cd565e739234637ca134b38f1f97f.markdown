Today AI systems are trained by ultimately using a classifier to perform a down-streaming task and are mostly evaluated on the task-success they reach. Not enough attention is given to how the classifier distributes the probabilities among the candidates out of which the target with the highest probability is selected. We propose to take the probability distribution as a litmus test to inspect models grounding skills. We take a visually grounded referential guessing game as test-bed  Cites: LXMERT: Learning Cross-Modality Encoder Representations from
