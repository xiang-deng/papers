Today, open data catalogs enable users to search for datasets with full-text queries in metadata records combined with simple faceted filtering. Using this combination, a user is able to discover a significant number of the datasets relevant to a user s search intent. However, there still remain relevant datasets that are hard to find because of the enormous sparsity of their metadata (eg, several keywords). As an alternative, in this paper, we propose an approach to dataset discovery based on Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
