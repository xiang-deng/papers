Fine-grained entity typing is referred to as identifying types of a target entity mention with context from a large number of fine-grained labels. Existing approaches depend on the quality of exogenous features or suffer from the distant supervision noise caused by multi-source inconsistency, and they usually ignore potential reasoning information provided by contextual entities. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage method that injects knowledge into both pre-trained contextualized word Cites: QuAC: Question answering in context
