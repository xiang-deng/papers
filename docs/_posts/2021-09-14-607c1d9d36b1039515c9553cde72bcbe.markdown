Given a passage and a question, Multiple-choice Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) requires to select the correct answer from several candidates. Existing methods consider more about the accuracy of the prediction of the final answer in a black box, which provides no concrete evidence to explain the choice making process. Intuitively, evidence is helpful in building a convincing multiple-choice MRC model. Due to the lack of the golden evidence labels and high cost of manual Cites: Triviaqa: A large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for
