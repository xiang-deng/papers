Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) person re-identification (re-ID) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to guide the task proposed on the unlabeled target domain, in which people share different identifications and cross multiple camera views within two different domains. Consequently, traditional UDA re-ID techniques generally suffer due to the negative transfer caused by the inevitable noise generated by variant backgrounds, while the foregrounds also lack sufficient …
