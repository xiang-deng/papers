Dialog state tracking (DST) is a core component in the task-oriented dialog systems. Many previous approaches regard DST as a classification task for a set of predefined slot-value pairs, but these approaches can not handle the situation of dynamic ontology. Other methods consider slot as span-based, while these methods are insufficient when the target slot-value cannot be found as a word segment in the dialog context. To mitigate these problems, we propose a Transformer-based model …
