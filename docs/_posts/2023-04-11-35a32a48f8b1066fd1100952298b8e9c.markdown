Methods based on artificial neural network (ANN) or deep neural network (DNN) applications have been proposed to predict job cycle time effectively. However, the predicting mechanism of ANNs (or DNNs) is often difficult to understand and communicate. This problem has hindered their acceptability (and practicability). Furthermore, existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques use simpler decision rules to approximate the prediction process and/or outcomes of ANNs (or  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
