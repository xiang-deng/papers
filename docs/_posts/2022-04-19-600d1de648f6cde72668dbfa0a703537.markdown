In recent years, with the rapid development of machine learning, automatic emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has received increasing attention. However, owing to the great variance of EEG signals sampled from different subjects, EEG-based emotion recognition experiences the individual difference problem across subjects, which significantly hinders recognition performance. In this study, we presented a method for EEG-based emotion Cites: Coupling retrieval and meta-learning for context-dependent
