While there is much research on cross-domain text classification, most existing approaches focus on one-to-one or many-to-one domain adaptation. In this paper, we tackle the more challenging task of domain generalization, in which domain-invariant representations are learned from multiple source domains, without access to any data from the target domains, and classification decisions are then made on test documents in unseen target domains. We propose a novel framework based on Cites: Meta-Learning for Domain Generalization in Semantic Parsing
