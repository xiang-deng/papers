Knowledge proximity refers to the strength of association between any two entities in a structural form that embodies certain aspects of a knowledge base. In this work, we operationalize knowledge proximity within the context of the US Patent Database (knowledge base) using a knowledge graph (structural form) named PatNet built using patent metadata, including citations, inventors, assignees, and domain classifications. Using several graph embedding models (eg, TransE, RESCAL), we Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
