Abstract Explainable AIs (XAIs) often do not provide relevant or understandable explanations for a domain-specific human-in-the-loop (HIL). In addition, internally used metrics have biases that might not match existing structures in the data. The habilitation thesis presents an alternative solution approach by deriving explanations from high dimensional structures in the data rather than from predetermined classifications. Typically, the detection of such density-or distance-based structures …
