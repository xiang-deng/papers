New knowledge originates from the old. The various types of elements, deposited in the training history, are a large amount of wealth for improving learning deep models. In this survey, we comprehensively review and summarize the topic--``Historical Learning: Learning Models with Learning History , which learns better neural models with the help of their learning history during its optimization, from three detailed aspects: Historical Type (what), Functional Part (where) and Storage Form (how). To  Cites: Robust fine-tuning of zero-shot models
