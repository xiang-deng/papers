This paper is interested in investigating whether human gaze signals can be leveraged to improve state-of-the-art search engine performance and how to incorporate this new input signal marked by human attention into existing neural retrieval models. In this paper, we propose GazBy ({\bf Gaz} e-based {\bf B} ert model for document relevanc {\bf y}), a light-weight joint model that integrates human gaze fixation estimation into transformer models to predict document relevance …
