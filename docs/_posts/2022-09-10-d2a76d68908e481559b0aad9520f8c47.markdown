Programming by example (PBE) is a technology that makes data transformation tasks, especially tabular data transformation, easier for data analysts by automatically generating transformation programs from user-given inputoutput examples. In recent years, PBE research using machine learning (ML) has emerged because of the recent success of ML in various research fields. We developed an ML-based PBE system for tabular data transformation in previous work. The system is  Cites: Foofah: Transforming data by example
