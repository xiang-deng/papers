Short-term power load forecasting is essential in ensuring the safe operation of power systems and a prerequisite in building automated power systems. Short-term power load demonstrates substantial volatility because of the effect of various factors, such as temperature and weather conditions. However, the traditional short-term power load forecasting method ignores the influence of various factors on the load and presents problems of limited nonlinear mapping ability and weak generalization Cites: Load forecasting using support vector machines: A study on
