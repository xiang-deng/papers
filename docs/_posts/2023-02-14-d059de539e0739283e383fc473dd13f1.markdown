Context and motivation: Requirements Engineering (RE) researchers have been experimenting Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches for a range of RE tasks, such as requirements classification, requirements tracing, ambiguity detection, and modelling. Question-problem: Most of today s ML-DL approaches are based on supervised learning techniques, meaning that they need to be trained using annotated datasets to learn how to assign a class label to sample  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
