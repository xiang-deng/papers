The development of adversarial technology, represented by adversarial text, has brought new challenges to rumor detection based on deep learning. In order to improve the robustness of rumor detection models under adversarial conditions, we propose a robust detection method based on the ensemble of multi-defense model on the basis of several mainstream defense methods such as data enhancement, random smoothing, and adversarial training. First, multiple robust detection models …
