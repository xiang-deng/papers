Neural abstractive summarization has been widely studied and achieved great success with large-scale corpora. However, the considerable cost of annotating data motivates the need for learning strategies under low-resource settings. In this paper, we investigate the problems of learning summarizers with only few examples and propose corresponding methods for improvements. First, typical transfer learning methods are prone to be affected by data properties and learning objectives in the  Cites: Coupling retrieval and meta-learning for context-dependent
