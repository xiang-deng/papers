Existing works on anomaly detection (AD) rely on clean labels from human annotators that are expensive to acquire in practice. In this work, we propose a method to leverage weak/noisy labels (eg, risk scores generated by machine rules for detecting malware) that are cheaper to obtain for anomaly detection. Specifically, we propose ADMoE, the first framework for anomaly detection algorithms to learn from noisy labels. In a nutshell, ADMoE leverages mixture-of-experts (MoE) Cites: Glam: Efficient scaling of language models with mixture-of-experts
