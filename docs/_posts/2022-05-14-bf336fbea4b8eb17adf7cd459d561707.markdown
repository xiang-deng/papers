Nonconvex regularization has been popularly used in low-rank matrix learning. However, extending it for low-rank tensor learning is still computationally expensive. To address this problem, we develop an efficient solver for use with a nonconvex extension of the overlapped nuclear norm regularizer. Based on the proximal average algorithm, the proposed algorithm can avoid expensive tensor folding/unfolding operations.
