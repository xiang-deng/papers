Recently, numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of bias in machine learning powered decision-making systems. Although most definitions of algorithmic bias have solid mathematical foundations, the corresponding bias detection techniques often lack statistical rigor, especially for non-iid data. We fill this gap in the literature by presenting a rigorous non-parametric testing procedure for bias according to Predictive Rate Parity, a commonly considered notion of algorithmic Cites: Verified uncertainty calibration
