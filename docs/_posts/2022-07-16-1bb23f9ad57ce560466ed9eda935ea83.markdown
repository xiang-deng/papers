Machine learning (ML) is playing an increasingly important role in data management tasks, particularly in Data Integration and Preparation (DI&P). The success of ML-based approaches, however, heavily relies on the availability of large-scale, high-quality labeled datasets for different tasks. Moreover, the wide variety of DI&P tasks and pipelines oftentimes requires customizing ML solutions which can incur a significant cost for model engineering and experimentation.
