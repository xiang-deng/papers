Domain adaptation on time-series data is often encountered in the industry but received limited attention in academia. Most of the existing domain adaptation methods for time-series data borrow the ideas from the existing methods for non-time series data to extract the domain-invariant representation. However, two peculiar difficulties to time-series data have not been solved. 1) It is not a trivial task to model the domain-invariant and complex dependence among different timestamps. 2) The Cites: Introduction to statistical relational learning
