Self-supervised graph-level representation learning aims to learn discriminative representations for subgraphs or entire graphs without human-curated labels. Recently, graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods have revolutionized this field and achieved state-of-the-art results in various downstream tasks. Nonetheless, current GCL models are mostly based on simple node-level information aggregation operations and fail to reveal various substructures from input graphs.
