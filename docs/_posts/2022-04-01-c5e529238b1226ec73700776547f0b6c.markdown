For a long period, different recommendation tasks typically require designing task- specific architectures and training objectives. As a result, it is hard to transfer the learned knowledge and representations from one task to another, thus restricting the generalization ability of existing recommendation approaches, eg, a sequential recommendation model can hardly be applied or transferred to a review generation method. To deal with such issues, considering that language grounding is a powerful Cites: Fantastically ordered prompts and where to find them: Overcoming
