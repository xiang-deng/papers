Reinforcement learning (RL) applications require a huge effort to become established in real-world environments, due to the injury and break down risks during interactions between the RL agent and the environment, in the online training process. In addition, the RL platform tools (eg, Python OpenAI s Gym, Unity ML-Agents, PyBullet, DART, MoJoCo, RaiSim, Isaac, and Air-Sim), that are required to reduce the real-world challenges, suffer from drawbacks (eg, the limited number of …
