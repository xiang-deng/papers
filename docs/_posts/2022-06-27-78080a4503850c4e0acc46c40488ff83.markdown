Abstract Introduction: the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease which has been declared a pandemic by the WHO. Diagnostic tests are expensive and are not always available. Researches using machine learning (ML) approach for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection have been proposed in the literature to reduce cost and allow better control of the pandemic.
