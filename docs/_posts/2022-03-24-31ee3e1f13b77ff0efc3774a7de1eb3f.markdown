This article illustrates different information visualization techniques applied to a database of classical composers and visualizes both the macrocosm of the Common Practice Period and the microcosms of twentieth century classical music. It uses data on personal (composer-to-composer) musical influences to generate and analyze network graphs. Data on style influences and composers  ecological data are then combined to composer-to-composer musical influences to build a similarity/distance Cites: Convolutional recurrent neural networks for music classification
