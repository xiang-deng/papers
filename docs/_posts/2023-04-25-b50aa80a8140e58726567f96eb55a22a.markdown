Mining query sub-intents or sub-topics is one of the important task in information retrieval. It provides the user several potential queries to explore possible search intents of the user. With the development of Big Data and Natural Language Processing, pre-trained language models have been applied to model complex semantic information of different text resources for mining robust query sub-intents. These studies usually utilize search results and query logs independently as two …
