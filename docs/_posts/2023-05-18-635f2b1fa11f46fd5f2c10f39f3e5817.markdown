Rigorous evaluation of the causal effects of semantic features on language model predictions can be hard to achieve for natural language reasoning problems. However, this is such a desirable form of analysis from both an interpretability and model evaluation perspective, that it is valuable to zone in on specific patterns of reasoning with enough structure and regularity to be able to identify and quantify systematic reasoning failures in widely-used models. In this vein, we pick a portion of Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
