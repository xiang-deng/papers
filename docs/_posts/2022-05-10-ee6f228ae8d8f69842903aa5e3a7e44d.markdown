The performance of supervised classification techniques often deteriorates when the data has noisy labels. Even the semi-supervised classification approaches have largely focused only on the problem of handling missing labels. Most of the approaches addressing the noisy label data rely on deep neural networks (DNN) that require huge datasets for classification tasks. This poses a serious challenge especially in process and manufacturing industries, where the data is limited and Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
