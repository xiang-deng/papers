Graph network analysis, which achieves widely application, is to explore and mine the graph structure data. However, existing graph network analysis methods with graph representation learning technique ignore the correlation between multiple graph network analysis tasks, and they need massive repeated calculation to obtain each graph network analysis results. Or they cannot adaptively balance the relative importance of multiple graph network analysis tasks, that lead to weak model fitting  Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
