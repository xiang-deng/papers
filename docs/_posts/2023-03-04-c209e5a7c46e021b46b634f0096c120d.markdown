Abstract Document-level Relation Extraction (RE) aims to infer complex semantic relations between entities in a document. Previous approaches leverage a multi-classification model to predict relation types between each entity pair. However, in contrast to sentence-level RE, document-level RE contains various entities expressed by mentions appearing across multiple sentences in a document. Therefore, the amount of negative instances ( no relationship ) significantly Cites: Graph convolution over pruned dependency trees improves
