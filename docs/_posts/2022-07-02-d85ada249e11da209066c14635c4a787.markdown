Despite their potential unknown deficiencies and biases, the takeover of critical tasks by AI machines in different fields has created a demand for transparency alongside accuracy for these machines. Explainable AI (XAI) approaches have provided solutions by mitigating the lack of transparency and trust in AI and making these machines more interpretable to the lay users. This dissertation investigates the role of explanations for deep learning models in computer vision. This research explores …
