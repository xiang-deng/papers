Given a natural language that describes the user s demands, the NL2Code task aims to generate code that addresses the demands. This is a critical but challenging task that mirrors the capabilities of AI-powered programming. The NL2Code task is inherently versatile, diverse and complex. For example, a demand can be described in different languages, in different formats, and at different levels of granularity. This inspired us to do this survey for NL2Code. In this survey, we focus on how does …
