Abstract Knowledge graphs are sizeable graph-structured knowledge with both abstract and concrete concepts in the form of entities and relations. Recently, convolutional neural networks have achieved outstanding results for more expressive representations of knowledge graphs. However, existing deep learning-based models exploit semantic information from single-level feature interaction, potentially limiting expressiveness. We propose a knowledge graph embedding  Cites: Knowledge Graph Representation with Jointly Structural and
