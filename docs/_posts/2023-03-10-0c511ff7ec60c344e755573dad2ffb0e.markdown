Bootstrapping a neural morphological analyzer from artificial data is not often feasible for linguists who do not have specialized training. We show that grammatical information in FLEx, a software tool familiar to many linguists, can be used to generate word forms and their morphosyntactic descriptors. The results of a pilot experiment with Lezgi [lez] indicates that the grammatical information must be structured in FLEx with data generation in mind to generate usable training data  Cites: Supervised Learning of Complete Morphological Paradigms.
