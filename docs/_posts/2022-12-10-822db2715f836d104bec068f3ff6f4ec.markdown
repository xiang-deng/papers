Interpolation techniques provide an effective method for recovery of missing traces. In recent years, many researchers have applied deep learning methods to seismic data interpolation. Generally, one can choose synthetic data as a training set; however, the features of synthetic data are always inconsistent with those of field data, which may lead to inaccurate interpolation. Meanwhile, U‐Net is a common network structure used in seismic data interpolation; however, the four …
