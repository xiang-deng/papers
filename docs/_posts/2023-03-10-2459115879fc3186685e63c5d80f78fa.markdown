Standard Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods assume the availability of both source and target data during the adaptation. In this work, we investigate the Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), a specific case of UDA where a model is adapted to a target domain without access to source data. We propose a novel approach for the TTA setting based on a loss reweighting strategy that brings robustness against the noise that inevitably affects the pseudo-labels. The classification loss is reweighted Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
