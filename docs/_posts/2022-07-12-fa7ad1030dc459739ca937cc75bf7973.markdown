Dialogue topic segmentation is a challenging task in which dialogues are split into segments with pre-defined topics. Existing works on topic segmentation adopt a two-stage paradigm, including text segmentation and segment labeling. However, such methods tend to focus on the local context in segmentation, and the inter-segment dependency is not well captured. Besides, the ambiguity and labeling noise in dialogue segment bounds bring further challenges to existing models. In this work  Cites: Text segmentation as a supervised learning task
