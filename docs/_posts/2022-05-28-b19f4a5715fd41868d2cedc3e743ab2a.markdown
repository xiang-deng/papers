In this work, we formulate\textbf {T} ext\textbf {C} lassification as a\textbf {M} atching problem between the text and the labels, and propose a simple yet effective framework named TCM. Compared with previous text classification approaches, TCM takes advantage of the fine-grained semantic information of the classification labels, which helps distinguish each class better when the class number is large, especially in low-resource scenarios. TCM is also easy to implement and is Cites: PPT: Pre-trained Prompt Tuning for Few-shot Learning
