Deep Learning optimization involves minimizing a high-dimensional loss function in the weight space which is often perceived as difficult due to its inherent difficulties such as saddle points, local minima, ill-conditioning of the Hessian and limited compute resources. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of 12 standard optimization methods successfully used in deep learning research and a theoretical assessment of the difficulties in numerical optimization from the optimization …
