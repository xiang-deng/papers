Distributed sparse block codes (SBCs) exhibit compact representations for encoding and manipulating symbolic data structures using fixed-with vectors. One major challenge however is to disentangle, or factorize, such data structures into their constituent elements without having to search through all possible combinations. This factorization becomes more challenging when queried by noisy SBCs wherein symbol representations are relaxed due to perceptual uncertainty and Cites: Transformer feed-forward layers are key-value memories
