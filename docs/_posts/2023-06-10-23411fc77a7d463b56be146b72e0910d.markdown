The recent development of generative and large language models (LLMs) poses new challenges for model evaluation that the research community and industry are grappling with. While the versatile capabilities of these models ignite excitement, they also inevitably make a leap toward homogenization: powering a wide range of applications with a single, often referred to as``general-purpose  , model. In this position paper, we argue that model evaluation practices must take on a critical task …
