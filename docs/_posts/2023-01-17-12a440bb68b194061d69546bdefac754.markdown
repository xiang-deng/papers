Recently, there has been increasing interest in data analysis services based on MapReduce framework, which is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating Big Data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster. Due to limited resource configuration, it is hard for end users to deal with computing-intensive data analysis tasks by themselves. Therefore, outsourcing these tasks to nearby edge computing servers (ie, multi  Cites: Challenges and opportunities with Big Data 2011-1
