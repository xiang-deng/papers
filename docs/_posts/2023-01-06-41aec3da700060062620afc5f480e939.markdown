As a field driven by empirical results, deep learning is home to numerous proposals of neural architecture design. Almost daily new papers get published that propose yet another slight modification to some architectural component to get a boost in performance. However, due to a large amount of confounding factors it is often unclear whether the performance increase is in fact due to the architectural change, or rather due to a difference in hyperparameters, a change in data pre-processing …
