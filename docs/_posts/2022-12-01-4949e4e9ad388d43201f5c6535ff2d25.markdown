Much of named entity recognition (NER) research focuses on developing dataset-specific models based on data from the domain of interest, and a limited set of related entity types. This is frustrating as each new dataset requires a new model to be trained and stored. In this work, we present a``versatile model--the Prompting-based Unified NER system (PUnifiedNER)--that works with data from different domains and can recognise up to 37 entity types simultaneously, and theoretically it Cites: Unifiedqa: Crossing format boundaries with a single qa system
