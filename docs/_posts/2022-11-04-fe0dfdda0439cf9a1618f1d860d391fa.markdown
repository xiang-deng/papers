We explore the promises and challenges of employing sequential decision-making algorithms--such as bandits, reinforcement learning, and active learning--in law and public policy. While such algorithms have well-characterized performance in the private sector (eg, online advertising), the tendency to naively apply algorithms motivated by one domain, often online advertisements, can be called the advertisement fallacy. Our main thesis is that law and public policy pose distinct Cites: The ai economist: Improving equality and productivity with ai
