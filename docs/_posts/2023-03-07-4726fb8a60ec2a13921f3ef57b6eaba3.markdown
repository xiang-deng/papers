Over the last years, the predictive power of supervised machine learning (ML) has undergone impressive advances, achieving the status of state of the art and super-human level in some applications. However, the employment rate of ML models in real-life applications is much slower than one would expect. One of the downsides of using ML solution-based technologies is the lack of user trust in the produced model, which is related to the black-box nature of these models. To leverage the application …
