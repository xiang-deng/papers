Abstract Natural Language Processing problems generally require the use of pre-trained distributed word representations to be solved with deep learning models. However, distributed representations usually rely on contextual information which prevents them from learning all the important word characteristics. The task of sentiment analysis suffers from such a problem because sentiment information is ignored during the process of learning word embeddings.
