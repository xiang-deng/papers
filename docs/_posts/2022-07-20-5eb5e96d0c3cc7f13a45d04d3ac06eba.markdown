Diverse real world systems can be abstracted as complex networks consisting of nodes and edges as functional components. Percolation theory has shown that the failure of a few of nodes could lead to the collapse of a whole network, which brings up the network dismantling problem: How to select the least number of nodes to decompose a network into disconnected components each smaller than a predefined threshold? For its NP-hardness, many heuristic approaches have been Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
