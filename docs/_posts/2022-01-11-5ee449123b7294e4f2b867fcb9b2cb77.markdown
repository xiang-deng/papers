Abstract Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular due to their impressive capacity to perform classification or regression on high-dimensional graph-structured data. However, standard message passing GNNs typically define nodes embeddings through a recursive neighborhood aggregation process which updates the representation vector of each node with reference to its neighborhood only. In this paper, we propose the Holistic Graph Neural Network (HGNN), a two-fold Cites: Effective approaches to attention-based neural machine translation
