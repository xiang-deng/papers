Lithium-ion batteries exhibit a dynamic voltage behaviour depending nonlinearly on current and state of charge. The modelling of lithium-ion batteries is therefore complicated and model parametrisation is often time demanding. Grey-box models combine physical and data-driven modelling to benefit from their respective advantages. Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) offer new possibilities for grey-box modelling. Differential equations given by physical laws and NODEs can Cites: Recurrent neural networks for multivariate time series with missing
