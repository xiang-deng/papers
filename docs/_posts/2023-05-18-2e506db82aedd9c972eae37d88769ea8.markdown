Lexical substitution (LS) aims at finding appropriate substitutes for a target word in a sentence. Recently, LS methods based on pretrained language models have made remarkable progress, generating potential substitutes for a target word through analysis of its contextual surroundings. However, these methods tend to overlook the preservation of the sentence s meaning when generating the substitutes. This study explores how to generate the substitute candidates from a paraphraser, as the Cites: Neurologic a* esque decoding: Constrained text generation with
