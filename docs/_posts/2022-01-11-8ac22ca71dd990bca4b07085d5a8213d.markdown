Predicting cyber threats is crucial for uncovering underlying security risks and proactively preventing malicious attacks. However, predicting cyber threats and demystifying the evolutionary patterns are challenging due to the heterogeneity and dynamics of cyber threats. In this paper, we propose CTP-DHGL, a novel Cyber Threat Prediction model based on Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Learning, to predict the potential cyber threats by investigating public security-related data (eg Cites: Structure-based protein function prediction using graph
