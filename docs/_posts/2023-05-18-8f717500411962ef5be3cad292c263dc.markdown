In machine learning (ML), Python serves as a convenient abstraction for working with key libraries such as PyTorch, scikit-learn, and others. Unlike DBMS, however, Python applications may lose important data, such as trained models and extracted features, due to machine failures or human errors, leading to a waste of time and resources. Specifically, they lack four essential properties that could make ML more reliable and user-friendly--durability, atomicity, replicability, and time-versioning Cites: DBOS: a DBMS-oriented Operating System
