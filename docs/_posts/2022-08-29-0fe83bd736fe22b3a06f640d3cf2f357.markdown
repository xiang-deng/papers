Existing strategies to identify relevant studies for systematic review may not perform equally well across research domains. We compare four approaches based on either human or automated screening of either title and abstract or full text; and report the training of a machine learning algorithm to identify in vitro studies from bibliographic records. We used a systematic review of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in PC-12 cells to compare approaches. For human screening, two reviewers independently  Cites: Risk of bias assessment in preclinical literature using natural
