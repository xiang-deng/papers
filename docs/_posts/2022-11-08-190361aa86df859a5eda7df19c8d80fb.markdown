Leveraging event logs to predict the evolution of an ongoing process is a challenging task in business process management (BPM). During the last years, sequence prediction models based on recurrent neural nets have demonstrated promise in this task attracting considerable interest from the community. Meanwhile, Transformer-based models and other architectures substituting recurrence with attention have become state-of-the-art in other sequence modeling tasks, especially in natural Cites: Multi-Source Neural Machine Translation with Missing Data
