In reinforcement learning applications, we often want to accurately estimate the return of several policies of interest. We study this problem, multiple-policy high-confidence policy evaluation, where the goal is to estimate the return of all given target policies up to a desired accuracy with as few samples as possible. The natural approaches to this problem, ie, evaluating each policy separately or estimating a model of the MDP, do not take into account the similarities between target policies Cites: Breaking the curse of horizon: Infinite-horizon off-policy estimation
