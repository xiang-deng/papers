Abstract Named Entity Recognition (NER) is generally regarded as a sequence labeling task, and faces a serious problem when the named entities are nested. Span-based model, which enumerates all possible spans as potential entity mentions in a sentence and classifies them, is straightforward for nested NER but faces negative samples problems. In this paper, we propose a span-based nested NER model with BERT and try to solve the negative samples problems. In view of the  Cites: Detecting formal thought disorder by deep contextualized word
