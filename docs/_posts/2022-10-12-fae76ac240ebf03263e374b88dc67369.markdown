Generating source code is necessary especially as software evolves in complexity and demand. Finding a mechanism to generate the source code according to the requirements will save time for developers at the stage of development of the software. In this paper, a mechanism is proposed to generate the source code based on the database schema and user requirements (user story). This model contains three layers: The first layer is to analyze each of the database schema, extract the Cites: A syntactic neural model for general-purpose code generation
