Neural architecture search (NAS) has recently gained extensive interest in the deep learning community because of its great potential in automating the construction process of deep models. Among a variety of NAS approaches, evolutionary computation (EC) plays a pivotal role with its merit of gradient-free search ability. However, a massive number of the current EC-based NAS approaches evolve neural architectures in an absolutely discrete manner, which makes it tough to flexibly Cites: Efficientnetv2: Smaller models and faster training
