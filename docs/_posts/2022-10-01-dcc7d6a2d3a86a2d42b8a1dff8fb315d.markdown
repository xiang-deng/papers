Visual perception and language understanding are-fundamental components of human intelligence, enabling them to understand and reason about objects and their interactions. It is crucial for machines to have this capacity to reason using these two modalities to invent new robot-human collaborative systems. Recent advances in deep learning have built separate sophisticated representations of both visual scenes and languages. However, understanding the associations between the two …
