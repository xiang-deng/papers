Current autograders of programming assignments are typically program output based; they fall short in many ways: eg they do not carry out subjective evaluations such as code quality, or whether the code has followed any instructor specified constraints; this is still done manually by teaching assistants. In this paper, we tackle a specific aspect of such evaluation: to verify whether a program implements a specific algorithm that the instructor specified. An algorithm, eg bubble sort, can be
