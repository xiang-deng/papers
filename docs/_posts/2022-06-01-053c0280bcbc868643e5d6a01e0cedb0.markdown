Abstract Machine learning (ML) often provides applicable high-performance models to facilitate decision-makers in various fields. However, this high performance is achieved at the expense of the interpretability of these models, which has been criticized by practitioners and has become a significant hindrance in their application. Therefore, in highly sensitive decisions, black boxes of ML models are not recommended. We proposed a novel methodology that uses complex supervised ML  Cites:   Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
