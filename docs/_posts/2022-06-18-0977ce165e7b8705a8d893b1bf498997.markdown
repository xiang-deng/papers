Recent work has focused on using machine learning to automate software engineering processes, such as code completion, code migration, and generating code from natural language description. One of the challenges faced in these tasks is evaluating the quality of the predictions, which is usually done by comparing the prediction to a reference solution. BLEU score has been adopted for programming languages as it can be easily computed for any programming language and even
