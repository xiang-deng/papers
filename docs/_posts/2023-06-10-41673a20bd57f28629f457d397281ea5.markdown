Software defects not only reduce operational reliability but also significantly increase overall maintenance costs. Consequently, it is necessary to predict software defects at an early stage. Existing software defect prediction studies work with artificially designed metrics or features extracted from source code by machine learning-based approaches to perform classification. However, these methods fail to make full use of the defect-related information other than code, such as comments in codes and  Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
