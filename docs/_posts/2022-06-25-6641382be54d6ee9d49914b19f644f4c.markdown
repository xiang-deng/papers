Processing and analyzing tabular data in a productive and efficient way is essential for building successful applications of machine learning in fields such as healthcare. However, the lack of a unified framework for representing and standardizing tabular information poses a significant challenge to researchers and professionals alike. In this work, we present TabText, a methodology that leverages the unstructured data format of language to encode tabular data from different table structures and time Cites: TaBERT: Pretraining for joint understanding of textual and tabular
