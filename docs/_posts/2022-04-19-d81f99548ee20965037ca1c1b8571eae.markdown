Abstract Data-to-Text Generation (D2T) is one of the most important sub-fields of Natural Language Generation where structured data is transcribed into natural language text. Several solutions have been proposed for D2T so far with relative success, including template-based, phrase structure grammar-based, and neural attention models. However, these methods also have problems such as grammatical flaws, limited naturalness, and semantic deficiencies. In this work, we propose a Cites: Inducing document plans for concept-to-text generation
