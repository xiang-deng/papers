Improvements in computational and experimental capabilities are rapidly increasing the amount of scientific data that is routinely generated. In applications that are constrained by memory and computational intensity, excessively large datasets may hinder scientific discovery, making data reduction a critical component of data-driven methods. Datasets are growing in two directions: the number of data points and their dimensionality. Whereas data compression techniques are concerned with reducing Cites: Visualization-aware sampling for very large databases
