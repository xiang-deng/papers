The aspect-opinion extraction tasks extract aspect terms and opinion terms from reviews. The supervised extraction methods achieve state-of-the-art performance but require large-scale human-annotated training data. Thus, they are restricted for open-domain tasks due to the lack of training data. This work addresses this challenge and simultaneously mines aspect terms, opinion terms, and their correspondence in a joint model. We propose an Open-Domain Aspect-Opinion Co-Mining (ODAO) Cites: A Frustratingly Easy Approach for Entity and Relation Extraction
