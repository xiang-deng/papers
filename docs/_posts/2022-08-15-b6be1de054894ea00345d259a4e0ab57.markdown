In this letter, we propose a novel scheme for symbol timing offset (STO) estimation by using a convolutional neural network (CNN)-deep neural network (DNN) model (CDM) architecture for the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system over different fading channel models. The proposed scheme estimates STO in the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO) and without prior knowledge of the channel, modulation format, and transmitted OFDM signal parameters.
