In the paper, the authors are presenting the outcome of web scraping software allowing for the automated classification of source code. The software system was prepared for a discussion forum for software developers to find fragments of source code that were published without marking them as code snippets. The analyzer software is using a Machine Learning binary classification model for differentiating between a programming language source code and highly technical text about  Cites: Learning to mine aligned code and natural language pairs from
