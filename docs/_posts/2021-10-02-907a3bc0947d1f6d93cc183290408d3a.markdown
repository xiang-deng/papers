Recent progress in generative language models has enabled machines to generate astonishingly realistic texts. While there are many legitimate applications of such models, there is also a rising need to distinguish machine-generated texts from human-written ones (eg, fake news detection). However, to our best knowledge, there is currently no benchmark environment with datasets and tasks to systematically study the so-called Turing Test problem for neural text generation Cites: Truth of varying shades: Analyzing language in fake news and
