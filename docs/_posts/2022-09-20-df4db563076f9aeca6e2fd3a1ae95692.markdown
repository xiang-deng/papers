We focus on developing a novel scalable graph-based semisupervised learning (SSL) method for input data consisting of a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. Due to the lack of labeled data and the availability of large-scale unlabeled data, existing SSL methods usually either encounter suboptimal performance because of an improper graph constructed from input data or are impractical due to the high-computational complexity of solving large-scale …
