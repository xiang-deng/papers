In this paper, we present our ongoing research on a convolutional neural network architecture for knowledge graph completion task called Multilayered ConvKB (MConvKB). Our new proposal is an extension to ConvKB with two main changes:(i) we added non-linear fully connected layers motivated by VGG architectures which acts as the last layer classifier, and (ii) we initialized the model with different pre-trained translational knowledge graph embeddings (TransE and TransD) to explore Cites: Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text
