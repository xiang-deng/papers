We present a novel rationale-centric framework with human-in-the-loop--Rationales- centric Double-robustness Learning (RDL)--to boost model out-of-distribution performance in few-shot learning scenarios. By using static semi-factual generation and dynamic human-intervened correction, RDL exploits rationales (ie phrases that cause the prediction), human interventions and semi-factual augmentations to decouple spurious associations and bias models towards generally applicable Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
