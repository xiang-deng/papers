Adversarial attacks seriously threaten the high accuracy of face anti-spoofing models. Little adversarial noise can perturb their classification of live and spoofing. The existing adversarial attacks fail to figure out which part of the target face anti-spoofing model is vulnerable, making adversarial analysis tricky. So we propose fine-grained attacks for exposing adversarial vulnerability of face anti-spoofing models. Firstly, we propose Semantic Feature Augmentation (SFA) module, which makes  Cites: Avoiding Reasoning Shortcuts: Adversarial Evaluation, Training
