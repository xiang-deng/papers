Creating decision models for risk assessment of ski injuries is a challenging task. Ski injuries are rare events, but they carry a high cost, that is, can cause working or movement disabilities. Usually, ski risk assessment is performed on smallscale, casecontrolled studies where the effect of a single factor is evaluated. Recently, data mining and machine learning algorithms are being employed for ski risk assessment and injury prediction. However, these models do not generally satisfy Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
