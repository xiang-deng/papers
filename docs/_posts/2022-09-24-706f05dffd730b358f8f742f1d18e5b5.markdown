Language models (LLMs) offer potential as a source of knowledge for agents that need to acquire new task competencies within a performance environment. We describe efforts toward a novel agent capability that can construct cues (or  prompts ) that result in useful LLM responses for an agent learning a new task. Importantly, responses must not only be  reasonable (a measure used commonly in research on knowledge extraction from LLMs) but also specific to the agent s task context and in a …
