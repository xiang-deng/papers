Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, mainly including esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer, are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Most GI cancers go through the stages of precancerous lesions, which can be defined as common conditions associated with a higher risk of developing cancers over time. Early identification of precancerous lesions has been shown to minimize the incidence of GI cancers and substantiate the vital role of screening endoscopy Cites: A closer look at deep learning heuristics: Learning rate restarts
