With the acceleration of urban expansion, urban change detection (UCD), as a significant and effective approach, can provide the change information with respect to geospatial objects for dynamic urban analysis. In recent years, through the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence, change detection methods have gradually developed from the traditional pixel-based comparison methods in the 1980s to data-driven deep learning methods. Deep learning methods have huge …
