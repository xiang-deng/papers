Learning adaptable policies in the absence of explicit reward signals is a challenging problem in reinforcement learning. We propose an algorithm that disentangles the morphology-aware variables from skill latent space for adapting quickly to unseen morphological changes. Through several task learning experiments using MuJoCo Ant environments, we demonstrate that the agent can perform zero-shot inference and adapt to mild modification in morphology within an  Cites: Explore, discover and learn: Unsupervised discovery of state
