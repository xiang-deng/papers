Deep neural network-based methods have been proved to achieve outstanding performance on object detection and classification tasks. Deep neural networks follow the``deeper model with deeper confidence  belief to gain a higher recognition accuracy. However, reducing these networks  computational costs remains a challenge, which impedes their deployment on embedded devices. For instance, the intersection management of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) requires … Cites: ‪Adaframe: Adaptive frame selection for fast video recognition‬
