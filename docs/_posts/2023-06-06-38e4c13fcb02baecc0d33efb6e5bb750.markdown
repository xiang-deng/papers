The shortage of information in text generation has been a prominent area of research in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current research endeavors aim to combine pre-trained models with rich open-world knowledge from external sources to increase the priori information and thereby enhance the informativeness of text generation. While recent studies suggest that integrating open-world and task-specific knowledge can improve text generation by addressing specific knowledge Cites: Latent retrieval for weakly supervised open domain question
