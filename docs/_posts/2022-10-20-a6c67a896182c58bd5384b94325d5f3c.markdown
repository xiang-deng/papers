Optimized deep neural network (DNN) models and energy-efficient hardware designs are of great importance in edge-computing applications. The neural architecture search (NAS) methods are employed for DNN model optimization with mixed-bitwidth networks. To satisfy the computation requirements, mixed-bitwidth convolution accelerators are highly desired for low-power and high-throughput performance. There exist several methods to support mixed-bitwidth multiply …
