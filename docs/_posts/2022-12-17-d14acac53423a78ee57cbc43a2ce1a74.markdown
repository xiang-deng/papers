Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) aims at clustering relation instances to extract relation types. By learning relation patterns between named entities, it clusters semantically equivalent patterns into a unified relation cluster. Existing clustering-based OpenRE methods only consider the information of the instance itself, ignoring knowledge of any relations between instances. Therefore, a Cross-Attention Fusion based Graph Convolution Auto-Encoder (CAGCE) method for Open Relation …
