Evaluating the quality of generated text is difficult, since traditional NLG evaluation metrics, focusing more on surface form than meaning, often fail to assign appropriate scores. This is especially problematic for AMR-to-text evaluation, given the abstract nature of AMR. Our work aims to support the development and improvement of NLG evaluation metrics that focus on meaning, by developing a dynamic CheckList for NLG metrics that is interpreted by being organized around meaning-relevant … Cites: ‪Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList‬
