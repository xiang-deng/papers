Named entity recognition (NER) is an essential part of the natural language processing (NLP) pipeline for the extraction of information as it finds application in many downstream applications. Many different rule-based, statistical, probabilistic, or hybrid approaches have been used to address it, the recent ones being machine or deep learning. Due to fast-changing technologies, many new developments have emerged in NER as well. This paper aims to provide a brief introduction, an overview Cites: Google, KT, Language, AI: BERT: pre-training of deep bidirectional
