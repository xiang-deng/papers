The exploration of the performance of elite athletes by cognitive neuroscience as a research method has become an emerging field of study in recent years. In the research of cognitive abilities and athletic performance of elite athletes, the tasks of an experiment are usually performed by athletics task of closed skills rather than open skills. Thus, little has been conducted to explore the cognitive abilities and athletic performance of elite athletes with open skills.
