Pronoun resolution is a challenging subset of an essential field in natural language processing called coreference resolution. Coreference resolution is about finding all entities in the text that refers to the same real-world entity. This paper presents a hybrid model combining multiple rulebased sieves with a machine-learning sieve for pronouns. For this purpose, seven high-precision rule-based sieves are designed for the Persian language. Then, a random forest classifier links pronouns to the previous …
