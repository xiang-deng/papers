Human intelligence can simultaneously process many tasks with the ability to accumulate and reuse knowledge. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, such as Transfer, Multitask and Layered Learning, seek to replicate these abilities. However, humans must specify the task order, which is often difficult particularly with uncertain domain knowledge. This work introduces a Continual-learning system (ConCS), such that given an open-ended set of problems once each is solved its solution can …
