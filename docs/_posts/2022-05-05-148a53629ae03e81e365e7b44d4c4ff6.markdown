The availability of a large amount of high-quality data is critical to the performance of machine-learning models. It is challenging to obtain a training dataset because data collection is costly and time-consuming. However, data scarcity can be overcome and an accurate model can be obtained if data from similar models are reused. In this paper, we propose an instance-based transfer learning method to obtain a more accurate model for situations with data scarcity. The proposed method uses a Cites: Understanding black-box predictions via influence functions
