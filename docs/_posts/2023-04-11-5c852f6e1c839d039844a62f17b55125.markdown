Synthetic data are becoming a critical tool for building artificially intelligent systems. Simulators provide a way of generating data systematically and at scale. These data can then be used either exclusively, or in conjunction with real data, for training and testing systems. Synthetic data are particularly attractive in cases where the availability of``real training examples might be a bottleneck. While the volume of data in healthcare is growing exponentially, creating datasets for novel tasks and/or that Cites: Unnatural language processing: Bridging the gap between
