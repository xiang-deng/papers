Generating programs to describe visual observations has gained much research attention recently. However, most of the existing approaches are based on non-parametric primitive functions, making them unable to handle complex visual scenes involving many attributes and details. In this paper, we propose the concept of parametric visual program induction. Learning to generate parametric programs for visual scenes is challenging due to the huge number of function variants and the
