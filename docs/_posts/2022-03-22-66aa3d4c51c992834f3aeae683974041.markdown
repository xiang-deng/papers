Objective: Disease knowledge graphs are a way to connect, organize, and access disparate information about diseases with numerous benefits for artificial intelligence (AI). To create knowledge graphs, it is necessary to extract knowledge from multimodal datasets in the form of relationships between disease concepts and normalize both concepts and relationship types. Methods: We introduce REMAP, a multimodal approach for disease relation extraction and classification. The REMAP Cites: Text generation from knowledge graphs with graph transformers
