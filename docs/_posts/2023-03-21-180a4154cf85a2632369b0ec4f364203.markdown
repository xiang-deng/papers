Recent studies have shown that significant performance improvements reported by neural rankers do not necessarily extend to a diverse range of queries. There is a large set of queries that cannot be effectively addressed by neural rankers primarily because relevant documents to these queries are not identified by first-stage retrievers. In this paper, we propose a novel document representation approach that represents documents within the query space, and hence increases the likelihood of …
