In the recent years, the deep reinforcement learning community has achieved impressive success to tackle real-world challenges. In this work, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning agent to perform floorplanning, one of the early stages of VLSI physical design. Traditional methods to solve floorplanning problem are intractable for large circuit netlists and impossible to learn from past experience. We adopt the domain knowledge of floorplanning representation and propose a learning Cites: Chip placement with deep reinforcement learning
