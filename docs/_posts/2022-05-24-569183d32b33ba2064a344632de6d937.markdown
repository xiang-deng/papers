Motivation Automated molecule generation is a crucial step in in-silico drug discovery. Graph-based generation algorithms have seen significant progress over recent years. However, they are often complex to implement, hard to train and can under-perform when generating long-sequence molecules. The development of a simple and powerful alternative can help improve practicality of automated drug discovery method. Results We proposed a ConvNet-based sequential graph Cites: Masked graph modeling for molecule generation
