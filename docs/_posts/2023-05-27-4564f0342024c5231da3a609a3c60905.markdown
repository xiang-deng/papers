Large language models (LMs) have exhibited superior in-context learning (ICL) ability to adopt to target tasks by prompting with a few input-output demonstrations. Towards better ICL, different methods are proposed to select representative demonstrations from existing training corpora. However, such a setting is not aligned with real-world practices, as end-users usually query LMs without accesses to demonstration pools. Inspired by evidence suggesting LMs zero-shot capabilities  Cites: Diverse Demonstrations Improve In-context Compositional
