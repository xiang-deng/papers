One probabilistic inference task concerns answering queries for conditional marginal distributions, where a set of events is given. In this paper, we investigate the problem of only knowing that events are observed, from a number of sensors or for individuals, but not which sensors or individuals exhibit those events specifically. This situation might occur in multi-agent settings, such as in nanosystems, where single agents can no longer be tracked. However, to be able to perform probabilistic Cites: Lifted Probabilistic Inference with Counting Formulas.
