One of the most important problems in computational linguistics is the grammar and, consequently, syntactic structures and structural parsing. The structural parser tries to analyze the relationships between words and to extract the syntactic structure of the sentence. The dependency-based structural parser is proper for free-wordorder and morphologically-rich languages such as Persian. The data-driven dependency parser performs the categorization process based on a wide range of features  Cites: Dependency parsing as head selection
