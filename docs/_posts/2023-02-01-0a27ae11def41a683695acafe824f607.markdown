Experimental solid mechanics is at a pivotal point where machine learning (ML) approaches are rapidly proliferating into the discovery process, due to significant advances in data storage and processing capabilities. Much of the ML that is being adopted by the mechanics community was initially developed for application outside of science and engineering, and has the potential to produce results of questionable physical validity. To ensure that these data-driven approaches are trustworthy, there Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
