In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful paradigm emerged from large language models (LLMs). Despite its promises, ICL performance is known to be highly sensitive to input examples. In this work, we use in-context influences to analyze few-shot ICL performance directly from the in-context examples. Our proposed influence-based example selection method outperforms most baselines when evaluated on 10 SuperGlue tasks and stably scales with increasing k-shot. The analysis finds up to a …
