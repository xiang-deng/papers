Data augmentation has played an important role in generalization capability and performance improvement for data-driven deep learning models in recent years. However, most of the existing data augmentation methods in NLP suffer from high manpower consumption or low promotion, which limits the practical applications. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective approach named Heuristic Masked Language Modeling (HMLM) to obtain high-quality data by introducing mask …
