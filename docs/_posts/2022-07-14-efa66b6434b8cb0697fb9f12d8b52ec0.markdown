Micro-and macro-architecture search have emerged as two popular NAS paradigms recently. Existing methods leverage different search strategies for searching micro-and macro-architectures. When using architecture parameters to search for micro-structure such as normal cell and reduction cell, the architecture parameters can not fully reflect the corresponding operation importance. When searching for the macro-structure chained by pre-defined blocks, many sub-networks need to be sampled for …
