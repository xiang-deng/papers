Neural-symbolic models bridge the gap between sub-symbolic and symbolic approaches, both of which have significant limitations. Sub-symbolic approaches, like neural networks, require a large amount of labeled data to be successful, whereas symbolic approaches, like logic reasoners, require a small amount of prior domain knowledge but do not easily scale to large collections of data. This chapter presents a general approach to integrate learning and reasoning that is based on the Cites: Learning reasoning strategies in end-to-end differentiable proving
