Building autonomous agents able to grow open-ended repertoires of skills across their lives is a fundamental goal of artificial intelligence (AI). A promising developmental approach recommends the design of intrinsically motivated agents that learn new skills by generating and pursuing their own goalsautotelic agents. But despite recent progress, existing algorithms still show serious limitations in terms of goal diversity, exploration, generalization or skill composition.
