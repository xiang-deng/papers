Neural networks produced by standard training tend to suffer from poor accuracy on rare subgroups despite achieving high accuracy on average due to the spurious correlation. Previously we proposed BAM, a novel two-stage training algorithm, comprising a bias amplification stage with the learnable auxiliary variable and rebalanced training stage using upweighted error samples, which empirically improves the worst-group accuracy in various benchmarks with state-of-the-art  Cites: Just train twice: Improving group robustness without training group
