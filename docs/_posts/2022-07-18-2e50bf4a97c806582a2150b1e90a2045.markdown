Abstract Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have proved their capability to model nonlinear relationships between users and items in recommender systems. Therefore, many researchers have exploited the DNN to model the non-linearity of individual interactions between users and items. However, it has been barely studied to model the non-linearity of a user s sequential item interactions that may be the fundamental clue to represent a user s interest naturally. This paper proposes a …
