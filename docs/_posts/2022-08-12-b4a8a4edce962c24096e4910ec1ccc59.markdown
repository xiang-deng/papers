This work describes the participation of our team in the ARQMath 2022 Lab, where we have applied two highly complementary methods for effective math answer and formula retrieval. More specifically, a lexical sparse retriever (Approach Zero) capable of first-stage structure matching is combined with a fine-tuned bi-encoder dense retriever (ColBERT) to capture contextual similarity and semantic matching. The dense retrieval model is further pretrained to adapt to math domain content Cites: Self-consistency improves chain of thought reasoning in language
