Current query expansion models use pseudo-relevance feedback to improve first-pass retrieval effectiveness; however, this fails when the initial results are not relevant. Instead of building a language model from retrieved results, we propose Generative Relevance Feedback (GRF) that builds probabilistic feedback models from long-form text generated from Large Language Models. We study the effective methods for generating text by varying the zero-shot generation subtasks: queries  Cites: Query Expansion Using Contextual Clue Sampling with Language
