Community detection technologies have the general research significance in complex networks, in which the topology information of network is worthy to be the focus for its widely application. It is the definition of community structure that the connection of nodes in the community is dense with the connection of nodes outside the community is sparse, which is corresponding to the core structure in the complex real networks is represented by a compact and dense set of connected nodes.
