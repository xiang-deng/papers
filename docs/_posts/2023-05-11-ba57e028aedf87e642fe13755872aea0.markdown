In recent years, Federated Learning (FL) has shown significant advancements in its ability to perform various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This work focuses on applying personalized FL for on-device language modeling. Due to limitations of memory and latency, these models cannot support the complexity of sub-word tokenization or beam search decoding, resulting in the decision to deploy a closed-vocabulary language model. However, closed-vocabulary models are unable Cites: Towards a unified view of parameter-efficient transfer learning
