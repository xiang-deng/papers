Text retrieval is a long-standing research topic on information seeking, where a system is required to return relevant information resources to user s queries in natural language. From classic retrieval methods to learning-based ranking functions, the underlying retrieval models have been continually evolved with the ever-lasting technical innovation. To design effective retrieval models, a key point lies in how to learn the text representation and model the relevance matching. The Cites: One question answering model for many languages with cross
