Network representation learning is one of the important works of analyzing network information. Its purpose is to learn a vector for each node in the network and map it into the vector space, and the resulting number of node dimensions is much smaller than the number of nodes in the network. Most of the current work only considers local features and ignores other features in the network, such as attribute features. Aiming at such problems, this paper proposes novel mechanisms of combining Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
