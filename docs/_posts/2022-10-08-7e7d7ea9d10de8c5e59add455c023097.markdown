Learning to produce contact-rich, dynamic behaviors from raw sensory data has been a longstanding challenge in robotics. Prominent approaches primarily focus on using visual or tactile sensing, where unfortunately one fails to capture high-frequency interaction, while the other can be too delicate for large-scale data collection. In this work, we propose a data-centric approach to dynamic manipulation that uses an often ignored source of information: sound. We first collect a dataset of …
