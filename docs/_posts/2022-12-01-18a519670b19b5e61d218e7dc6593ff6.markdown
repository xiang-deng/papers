Modeling dynamics in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs) is an effectual way to understand real-world physics processes. For complex physics systems, analytical solutions are not available and numerical solutions are widely-used. However, traditional numerical algorithms are computationally expensive and challenging in handling multiphysics systems. Recently, using neural networks to solve PDEs has made significant progress, called physics-informed neural networks …
