Many modern high-performing machine learning models such as GPT-3 primarily rely on scaling up models, eg, transformer networks. Simultaneously, a parallel line of work aims to improve the model performance by augmenting an input instance with other (labeled) instances during inference. Examples of such augmentations include task-specific prompts and similar examples retrieved from the training data by a nonparametric component. Remarkably, retrieval-based methods have enjoyed Cites: Few-shot learning with retrieval augmented language models
