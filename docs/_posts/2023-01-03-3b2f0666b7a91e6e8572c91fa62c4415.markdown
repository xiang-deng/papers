While implementing software projects, developers do not reinvent the wheel but try to reuse existing API calls and source code. In recent years, the problems related to recommending APIs and code snippets have been intensively investigated. Although current approaches have achieved encouraging performance, there is still the need to improve the recommendation process s effectiveness and efficiency. In this work, we reformulate the problem of API recommendations by proposing learning and  Cites: Effective approaches to attention-based neural machine translation
