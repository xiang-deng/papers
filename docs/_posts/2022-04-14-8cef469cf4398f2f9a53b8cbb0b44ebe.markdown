Graph neural network is a deep learning approach widely applied on structural and non-structural scenarios due to its substantial performance and interpretability recently. In a non-structural scenario, textual and visual research topics like visual question answering (VQA) are important, which need graph reasoning models. VQA aims to build a system that can answer related questions about given images as well as understand the underlying semantic meaning behind the image.
