Document-level event extraction (DEE) aims at extracting event records from given documents. Existing DEE methods handle troublesome challenges by using multiple encoders and casting the task into a multi-step paradigm. However, most of the previous approaches ignore a missing feature by using mean pooling or max pooling operations in different encoding stages and have not explicitly modeled the interdependency features between input tokens, and thus the long-distance problem …
