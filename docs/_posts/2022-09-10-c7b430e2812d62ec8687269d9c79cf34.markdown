Source code documentation is an important artifact for efficient software development. Code documentation could greatly benefit from automation since manual documentation is often labouring, resource and time-intensive. In this paper, we employed Codex for automatic code documentation creation. Codex is a GPT-3 based model pre-trained on both natural and programming languages. We find that Codex outperforms existing techniques even with basic settings like one-shot  Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
