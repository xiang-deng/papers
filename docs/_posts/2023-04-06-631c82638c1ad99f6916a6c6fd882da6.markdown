The partial label ranking problem is a particular preference learning scenario that focuses on learning preference models from data, such that they predict a complete ranking with ties defined over the values of the class variable for a given input instance. This work proposes to transform the rankings into preference relations among pairs of class labels and to learn a standard classifier for each of them. This classifier is then used to estimate the probability of each event from the preference Cites: Constraint classification for multiclass classification and ranking
