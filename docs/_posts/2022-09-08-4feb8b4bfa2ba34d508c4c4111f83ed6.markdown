Power equipment operation and maintenance (O&M) requires plenty of domain knowledge to improve equipment security and power grid reliability. However, most knowledge is implicitly represented by the semantic text, which is hard to be comprehended by algorithms and restricts the intelligence level of equipment O&M. Therefore, this article proposes an event knowledge graph system to automatically extract event knowledge from O&M reports and represent the knowledge by an event  Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
