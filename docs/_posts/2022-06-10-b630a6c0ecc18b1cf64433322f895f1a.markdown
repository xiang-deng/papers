Multimodal Analytics in Big Data architectures implies compounded configurations of the data processing tasks. Each modality in data requires specific analytics that triggers specific data processing tasks. Scalability can be reached at the cost of an attentive calibration of the resources shared by the different tasks searching for a trade-off with the multiple requirements they impose. We propose a methodology to address multimodal analytics within the same data processing approach to get a Cites: A vision for management of complex models
