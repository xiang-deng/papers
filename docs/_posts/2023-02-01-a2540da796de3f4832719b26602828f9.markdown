In this paper we present a novel method, $\textit {Knowledge Persistence} $($\mathcal {KP} $), for faster evaluation of Knowledge Graph (KG) completion approaches. Current ranking-based evaluation is quadratic in the size of the KG, leading to long evaluation times and consequently a high carbon footprint. $\mathcal {KP} $ addresses this by representing the topology of the KG completion methods through the lens of topological data analysis, concretely using persistent homology Cites: The carbon footprint of machine learning training will plateau, then
