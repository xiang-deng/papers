Despite the extensive investment and impressive recent progress at reasoning by similarity, deep learning continues to struggle with more complex forms of reasoning such as non-monotonic and commonsense reasoning. Non-monotonicity is a property of non-classical reasoning typically seen in commonsense reasoning, whereby a reasoning system is allowed (differently from classical logic) to jump to conclusions which may be retracted later, when new information becomes available Cites: Never-ending learning
