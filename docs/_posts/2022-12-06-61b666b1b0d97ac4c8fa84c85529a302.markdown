Learning meaningful representations from network data is critical to ease the adoption of AI as a cornerstone to process network logs. Since a large portion of such data is textual, Natural Language Processing (NLP) appears as an obvious candidate to learn their representations. Indeed, the literature proposes impressive applications of NLP applied to textual network data. However, in the absence of labels, objectively evaluating the goodness of the learned representations is still an Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
