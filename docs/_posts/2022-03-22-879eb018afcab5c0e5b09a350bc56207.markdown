If left untreated, Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a leading cause of slowly progressive dementia. Therefore, it is critical to detect AD to prevent its progression. In this study, we propose a bidirectional progressive recurrent network with imputation (BiPro) that uses longitudinal data, including patient demographics and biomarkers of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to forecast clinical diagnoses and phenotypic measurements at multiple timepoints.
