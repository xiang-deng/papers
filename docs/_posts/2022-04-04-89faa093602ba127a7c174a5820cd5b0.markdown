Since the rise of vision-language navigation (VLN), great progress has been made in instruction following--building a follower to navigate environments under the guidance of instructions. However, far less attention has been paid to the inverse task: instruction generation--learning a speaker~ to generate grounded descriptions for navigation routes. Existing VLN methods train a speaker independently and often treat it as a data augmentation tool to strengthen the follower while ignoring rich Cites: Question answering and question generation as dual tasks
