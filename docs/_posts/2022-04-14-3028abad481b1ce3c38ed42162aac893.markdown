A graph structure having nodes and edges is represented as an adjacency matrix, and nodes of the graph structure have node features. A computer-implemented method and system for generating a graph structure are provided, the method comprising: generating an adjacency matrix based on a plurality of node features; generating a plurality of noisy node features based on the plurality of node features; generating a plurality of denoised node features using a neural network based on Cites: Strategies for pre-training graph neural networks
