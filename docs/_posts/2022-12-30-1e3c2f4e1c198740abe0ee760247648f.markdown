Port state control (PSC) is the last line of defense for substandard ships. During a PSC inspection, ship detention is the most severe result if the inspected ship is identified with critical deficiencies. Regarding the development of ship detention prediction models, this paper identifies two challenges: learning from imbalanced data and learning from unlabeled data. The first challenge, imbalanced data, arises from the fact that a minority of inspected ships were detained. The second challenge …
