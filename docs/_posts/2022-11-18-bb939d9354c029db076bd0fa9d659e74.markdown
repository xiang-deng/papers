In this paper, we propose the task of consecutive question generation (CQG), which generates a set of logically related question-answer pairs to understand a whole passage, with a comprehensive consideration of the aspects including accuracy, coverage, and informativeness. To achieve this, we first examine the four key elements of CQG, ie, question, answer, rationale, and context history, and propose a novel dynamic multitask framework with one main task generating a question-answer Cites: Ditch the Gold Standard: Re-evaluating Conversational Question
