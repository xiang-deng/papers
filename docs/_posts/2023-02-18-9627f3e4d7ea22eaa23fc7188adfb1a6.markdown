Abstract Knowledge-aided dialogue response generation aims at augmenting chatbots with relevant external knowledge in the hope of generating more informative responses. The majority of previous work assumes that the relevant knowledge is given as input or retrieved from a static pool of knowledge. However, this assumption violates the real-world situation, where knowledge is continually updated and a chatbot has to dynamically retrieve useful knowledge.
