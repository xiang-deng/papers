Due to the scarcity of labeled data, using supervised models pre-trained on ImageNet is a de facto standard in remote sensing scene classification. Recently, the availability of larger high resolution remote sensing (HRRS) image datasets and progress in self-supervised learning have brought up the questions of whether supervised ImageNet pre-training is still necessary for remote sensing scene classification and would supervised pre-training on HRRS image datasets or self …
