What makes few-shot models effective? is it the sheer amount of data they are trained on? Or can data-lean models achieve similar performance by carefully selecting the training data? In this work, we demonstrate that in the context of few-shot relation classification, the diversity of the training data is far more important than its size: we train models with a fixed amount of data but with a varying number of relations. We find that few-shot performance on relations that were unseen at training Cites: Super-naturalinstructions: Generalization via declarative
