Dedicated tensor accelerators demonstrate the importance of linear algebra in modern applications. Such accelerators have the potential for impressive performance gains, but require programmers to rewrite code using vendor APIs-a barrier to wider scale adoption. Recent work overcomes this by matching and replacing patterns within code, but such approaches are fragile and fail to cope with the diversity of real-world codes. We develop ATC, a compiler that uses program  Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
