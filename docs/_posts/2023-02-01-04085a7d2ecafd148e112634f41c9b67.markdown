Computational natural language processing (NLP) is indispensable in a humanized ambience intelligence environment. NLP facilitates ambient intelligence by making machines understand, and be understood by, humans. This in turn makes machines behave more human-like than they typically are today. Technological advances in machine learning (ML), and especially deep learning (DL), have been a key enabler of NLP research. This paper begins with a survey of recent developments of ML/DL Cites: Joint learning of question answering and question generation
