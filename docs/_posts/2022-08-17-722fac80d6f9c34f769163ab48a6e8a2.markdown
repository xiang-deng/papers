While Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) has presented promising ability to learn representations for documents, most existing VGAE methods do not model a latent topic structure and therefore lack semantic interpretability. Exploring hidden topics within documents and discovering key words associated with each topic allow us to develop a semantic interpretation of the corpus. Moreover, documents are usually associated with authors. For example, news reports have journalists Cites: Citation author topic model in expert search
