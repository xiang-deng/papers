The Transformer-based approaches to solving natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as BERT and GPT are gaining popularity due to their ability to achieve high performance. These approaches benefit from using enormous data sizes to create pre-trained models and the ability to understand the context of words in a sentence. Their use in the information retrieval domain is thought to increase effectiveness and efficiency. This paper demonstrates a BERT-based method  Cites: Multi-stage document ranking with BERT
