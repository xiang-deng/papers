Software documentation largely consists of short, natural language summaries of the subroutines in the software. These summaries help programmers quickly understand what a subroutine does without having to read the source code themselves. The task of writing these descriptions is called  source code summarization.  The state-of-the-art in source code summarization is an encoder-decoder neural network with attention. Current research in this area focuses on improving these models on the …
