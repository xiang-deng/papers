Existing wisdom demonstrates the significance of syntactic knowledge for the improvement of neural machine translation models. However, most previous works merely focus on leveraging the source syntax in the well-known encoder-decoder framework. In sharp contrast, this paper proposes an end-to-end translation architecture from the (graph\& sequence) structural inputs to the (graph\& sequence) outputs, where the target translation and its corresponding syntactic graph are jointly Cites: Text generation from knowledge graphs with graph transformers
