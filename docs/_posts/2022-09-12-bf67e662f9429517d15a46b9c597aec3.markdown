Automatically finding similar cases in legal domain plays can benefit the legal system a lot. However, the annotation of legal document similarities can be time-consuming and expensive. In this study, we focus on low-resource similar case matching in the legal domain, checking which two cases are more similar among a triplet. We propose specifically designed data augmentation techniques for contrastive learning including Truncation, Double-dropout and Prompt, and consider document-level Cites: CAIL2019-SCM: A Dataset of Similar Case Matching in Legal
