ABSTRACT The task of Query Performance Prediction (QPP) in Information Retrieval (IR) involves predicting the relative effectiveness of a search system for a given input query. Supervised approaches for QPP, such as NeuralQPP [24] are often trained on pairs of queries to capture their relative retrieval performance. However, pointwise approaches, such as the recently proposed BERT-QPP [1], are generally preferable for efficiency reasons. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural cross …
