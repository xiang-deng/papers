Aggressive data augmentation is a key component of the strong generalization capabilities of Vision Transformer (ViT). One such data augmentation technique is adversarial training (AT); however, many prior works have shown that this often results in poor clean accuracy. In this work, we present pyramid adversarial training (PyramidAT), a simple and effective technique to improve ViT s overall performance. We pair it with a  matched  Dropout and stochastic depth regularization, which …
