Improving language model generations according to some user-defined quality or style constraints is challenging. Typical approaches include learning on additional human-written data, filtering``low-quality  data using heuristics and/or using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). However, filtering can remove valuable training signals, whereas data collection and RLHF constantly require additional human-written or LM exploration data which can be costly to obtain. A …
