The idea that computers can build their own programs is extremely significant, and many researchers are working on this challenge. Code generation is described as the process of generating executable code that can be run directly on the computer and fulfills the natural language requirements. It is an intriguing topic that might assist developers to learn a new software technology or programming language, or it could be a simple technique to help in coding through the description of the natural Cites: Incorporating external knowledge through pre-training for natural
