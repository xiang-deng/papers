Recommendation systems based on knowledge graphs often obtain user preferences through the user s click matrix. However, the click matrix represents static data and cannot represent the dynamic preferences of users over time. Therefore, we propose DINK, a knowledge graph-based deep interest exploration network, to extract users dynamic interests. DINK can be divided into a knowledge graph embedding layer, an interest exploration layer, and a recommendation layer Cites: Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for
