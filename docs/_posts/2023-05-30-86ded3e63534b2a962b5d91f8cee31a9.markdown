Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful tool in machine learning, but understanding the learned representations and their underlying mechanisms remains a challenge. This paper presents an in-depth empirical analysis of SSL-trained representations, encompassing diverse models, architectures, and hyperparameters. Our study reveals an intriguing aspect of the SSL training process: it inherently facilitates the clustering of samples with respect to semantic labels …
