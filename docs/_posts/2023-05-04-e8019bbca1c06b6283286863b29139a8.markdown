The energy levels of atoms and molecules exposed to intense, short, high-frequency laser pulses undergo time-dependent distortion known as dynamic Stark shift (DSS). These level shifts are induced by the coupling with nonresonant (nonessential) states and follow the temporal intensity profile of the laser pulse. Owing to the different DSSs of the individual atomic levels, transient resonance suppressions and enhancements significantly modify the multiphoton ionization pathway, leaving clear …
