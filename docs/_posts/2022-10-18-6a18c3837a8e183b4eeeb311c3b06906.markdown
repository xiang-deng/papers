Previous works mainly employ triple structural information in learning representations for knowledge graph, which results in poor performance of link prediction especially when it predicts new or few-fact entities. It is intuitive to introduce text information to supplement the missing semantic information for knowledge representation. However, existing methods only make alignment on the level of word or score function, and have not yet considered textual and structural  Cites: KEPLER: A Unified Model for Knowledge Embedding and Pre
