Constructionist approaches to language make use of form-meaning pairings, called constructions, to capture all linguistic knowledge that is necessary for comprehending and producing natural language expressions. Language processing consists then in combining the con-structions of a grammar in such a way that they solve a given language comprehension or production problem. Finding such an adequate se-quence of constructions constitutes a search problem that is combi …
