Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated great power for the semi-supervised node classification task. However, most GNN methods are sensitive to the noise of graph structures. Graph structure learning (GSL) is then introduced for robustification, which contains two major parts: recovering the optimal graph and fine-tuning the GNN parameters on this generated graph for the downstream task. Nonetheless, most of the existing GSL solutions merely focus on the node features Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
