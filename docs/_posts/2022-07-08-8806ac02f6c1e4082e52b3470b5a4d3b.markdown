Social media data that characterize users can provide mental health signals, including suicide risks. Existing methods for suicide risk identification on social media have demonstrated promising results; however, the limitation of existing methods is that they are unable to capture low-and high-level features with complex structured data on social media and are incapable of explaining the predicted labels. Explainable models are more useful when translated, so we aimed to evaluate a  Cites: Multi-Channel Graph Neural Network for Entity Alignment
