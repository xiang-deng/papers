Graph neural networks (GNN) have been applied in the session-based recommendation, which aims to predict the potential items the user will interact with next time based on the given anonymous interaction sequences. Most advanced GNN-based recommendation methods (eg, LESSR, SGNN-HN and GCE-GNN) focus on how to either capture long-range dependencies or use global context information to enhance the recommendation performance. However, these approaches do not Cites: Empirical evaluation of gated recurrent neural networks on
