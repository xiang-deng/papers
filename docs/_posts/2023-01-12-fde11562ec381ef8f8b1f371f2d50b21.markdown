We present MEGAnno, a novel exploratory annotation framework designed for NLP researchers and practitioners. Unlike existing labeling tools that focus on data labeling only, our framework aims to support a broader, iterative ML workflow including data exploration and model development. With MEGAnno s API, users can programmatically explore the data through sophisticated search and automated suggestion functions and incrementally update task schema as their project evolve  Cites: Talen: Tool for annotation of low-resource entities
