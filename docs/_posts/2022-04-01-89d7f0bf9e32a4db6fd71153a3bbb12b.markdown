We consider the problem of generating SQL notebooks of comparison queries for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). A comparison query allows to find insights in a dataset by specifying the comparison of subsets of data. In this paper, we study the problem of generating sequences of comparison queries that are insightful and coherent. We propose exact and approximate resolution approaches, and study their efficiency and effectiveness on artificial and real datasets, as well as with a user Cites: Interactive itinerary planning
