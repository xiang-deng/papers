Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms contain plenty of CQA texts (ie, questions and answers corresponding to the question) where named entities appear ubiquitously. In this paper, we define a new task of CQA entity linking (CQAEL) as linking the textual entity mentions detected from CQA texts with their corresponding entities in a knowledge base. This task can facilitate many downstream applications including expert finding and knowledge base enrichment. Traditional entity linking  Cites: Zero-Shot Entity Linking by Reading Entity Descriptions
