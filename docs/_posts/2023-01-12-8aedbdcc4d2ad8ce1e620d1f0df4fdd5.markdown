This paper explores deep latent variable models for semi-supervised paraphrase generation, where the missing target pair is modelled as a latent paraphrase sequence. We present a novel unsupervised model named variational sequence auto-encoding reconstruction (VSAR), which performs latent sequence inference given an observed text. To leverage information from text pairs, we introduce a supervised model named dual directional learning (DDL). Combining VSAR with …
