Meta learning recently has been heavily researched and helped advance the contemporary machine learning. However, achieving well-performing meta-learning model requires a large amount of training tasks with high-quality meta-data representing the underlying task generalization goal, which is sometimes difficult and expensive to obtain for real applications. Current meta-data-driven meta-learning approaches, however, are fairly hard to train satisfactory meta-models with imperfect  Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
