Generation of pseudo-code descriptions of legacy source code for software maintenance is a manually intensive task. Recent encoder-decoder language models have shown promise for automating pseudo-code generation for high resource programming languages such as C++, but are heavily reliant on the availability of a large code-pseudocode corpus. Soliciting such pseudocode annotations for codes written in legacy programming languages (PL) is a time  Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
