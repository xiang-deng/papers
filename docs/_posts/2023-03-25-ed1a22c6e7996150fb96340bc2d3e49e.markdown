A complete printing process was developed to fabricate the quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells with monolithic structures (m-QS-DSSCs). First, a structure of m-DSSCs was constructed by sequentially printing TiO2 layers (main and scattering), a ZrO2 insulating layer, and a carbon counter electrode (CE) onto an FTO substrate (FTO/TiO2/ZrO2/carbon CE). Then, a quasi-solid-state printable electrolyte (QS-PE), prepared using polyethylene oxide/polymethyl methacrylate, was printed directly on Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
