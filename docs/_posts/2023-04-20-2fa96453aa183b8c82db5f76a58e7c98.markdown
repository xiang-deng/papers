Although multi-task deep neural network (DNN) models have computation and storage benefits over individual single-task DNN models, they can be further optimized via model compression. Numerous structured pruning methods are already developed that can readily achieve speedups in single-task models, but the pruning of multi-task networks has not yet been extensively studied. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of structured pruning on multi-task models. We use an  Cites: Multi-task self-training for learning general representations
