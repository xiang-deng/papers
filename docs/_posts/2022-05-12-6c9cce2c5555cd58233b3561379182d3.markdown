Rainfall-runoff modeling, a nonlinear time series process, is challenging and important in hydrological sciences. Among the data-driven approaches, those ones based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) network show their promising performance. In this paper, for rainfall-runoff modeling, we propose a novel data- driven framework named long short-term memory based step-sequence (LSTM-SS) framework, which contains m specific models for m-step-ahead runoff predictions Cites: Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder
