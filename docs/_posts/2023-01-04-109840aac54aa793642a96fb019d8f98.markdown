Commonsense question answering has always been a challenging task due to the wide-domain coverage and the implicity of commonsense knowledge. Few works are tackling the answer generation of commonsense questions, which is more difficult than multiple-choice. This motivates us to delve into the answer generation ability of pre-trained language models (PLMs). Other than utilizing knowledge bases to extract commonsense-related knowledge to answer commonsense questions, we exploit …
