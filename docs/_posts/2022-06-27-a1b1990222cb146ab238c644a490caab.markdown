We propose and test multiple neuro-symbolic methods for sentiment analysis. They combine deep neural networkstransformers and recurrent neural networkswith external knowledge bases. We show that for simple models, adding information from knowledge bases significantly improves the quality of sentiment prediction in most cases. For medium-sized sets, we obtain significant improvements over state-of-the-art transformer-based models using our proposed methods: Tailored KEPLER and  Cites: KEPLER: A Unified Model for Knowledge Embedding and Pre
