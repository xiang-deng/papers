A light microscopy-based histopathology diagnosis of human brain specimens obtained from epilepsy surgery remains the gold standard to confirm the underlying cause of a patient s focal epilepsy and further inform postsurgical patient management. The differential diagnosis of neocortical specimens in the realm of epilepsy surgery remains, however, challenging. Herein, we developed an open access, deep learning-based classifier to histopathologically assess whole slide Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
