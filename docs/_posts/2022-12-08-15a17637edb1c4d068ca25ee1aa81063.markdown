Anomaly detection is the key to Quality of Service (QoS) in many modern systems. Logs, which record the runtime information of system, are widely used for anomaly detection. The security of the log-based anomaly detection has not been well investigated. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on black-box attacks on log-based anomaly detection. We investigate eight different methods on log attacking and compare their performance on various log parsing methods and log anomaly …
