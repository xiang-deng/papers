The development of ultra-dense heterogeneous networks (HetNets) will cause a significant rise in energy consumption with large-scale base station (BS) deployments, requiring cellular networks to be more energy efficient to reduce operational expense and promote sustainability. Cell switching is an effective method to achieve the energy efficiency goals, but traditional heuristic cell switching algorithms are computationally demanding with limited generalization abilities for Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
