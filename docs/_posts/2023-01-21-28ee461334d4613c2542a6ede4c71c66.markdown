Abstract GPT-3, since its release, has garnered the attention of the NLP community due to its versatility across a wide range of NLP tasks. In this work, we use GPT-3 to approach the OpenQA task, where the model needs to answer input questions without being given the golden passage that contains the correct answer. We work on engineering the GPT-3 input to improve its performance on the OpenQA task in the in-context learning setting. We propose three different incontext learning example  Cites: Latent retrieval for weakly supervised open domain question
