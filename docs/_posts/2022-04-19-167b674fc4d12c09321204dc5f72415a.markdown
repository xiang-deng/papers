We explore deep clustering of text representations for unsupervised model interpretation and induction of syntax. As these representations are high- dimensional, out-of-the-box methods like KMeans do not work well. Thus, our approach jointly transforms the representations into a lowerdimensional cluster- friendly space and clusters them. We consider two notions of syntax: part of speech induction (POSI) and constituency labelling (CoLab) in this work. Interestingly, we Cites: A structural probe for finding syntax in word representations
