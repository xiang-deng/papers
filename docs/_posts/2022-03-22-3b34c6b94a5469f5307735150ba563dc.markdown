Biomedical Named-Entity Recognition (BioNER) has become an essential part of text mining due to the continuously increasing digital archives of biological and medical articles. While there are many well-performing BioNER tools for entities such as genes, proteins, diseases or species, there is very little research into food and dietary constituent named-entity recognition. For this reason, in this paper, we study seven BioNER models for food and dietary constituents recognition. Specifically, we study a Cites: Electra: Pre-training text encoders as discriminators rather than
