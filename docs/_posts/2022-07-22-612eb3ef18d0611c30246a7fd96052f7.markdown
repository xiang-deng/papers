Multi-agent trajectory prediction is a challenging task because of the uncertainty of agents behaviors, interactions between agents, complex road geometry in urban environments, and imperfect/noisy agent histories. Although accurate prediction results are critical for safe and reliable intelligent driving applications (eg, decision making, motion planning), some other applications may prefer light-weight and computation-efficient trajectory prediction models to handle dynamically changed  Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
