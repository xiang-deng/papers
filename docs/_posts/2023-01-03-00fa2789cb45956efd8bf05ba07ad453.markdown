Recently, the behavior tree is gaining popularity as a robotic task-level knowledge representation. Manual design of behavior trees from scratch is tedious and cumbersome. Motivated by the need for an efficient way to reuse or transfer robot task-level knowledge, we propose a vector-space embedding approach that encodes a symbolic task into a numerical form. This approach, called behavior-tree embedding, takes a behavior tree that produces a single task as input and generates …
