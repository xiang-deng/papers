This paper gives a condensed summary of our work (Mo et al., 2022) published in the Findings of ACL 2022 and adds a discussion section to talk about its connection with interactive learning. Existing studies on semantic parsing focus on mapping a natural-language utterance to a logical form (LF) in one turn. However, given that natural language may contain ambiguity and variability, it is challenging for a parser to obtain high enough accuracy for real use. In this work, we present INSPIRED 1, a Cites: Repartitioning of the COMPLEXWEBQUESTIONS Dataset
