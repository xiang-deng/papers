In skeleton-based action recognition, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved remarkable performance since the skeleton representation of human action can be naturally modeled by the graph structure. Most of the existing GCN-based methods extract skeleton features by exploiting single-scale joint information, while neglecting the valuable multi-scale contextual information. Besides, the commonly used strided convolution in temporal dimension could evenly filters out the keyframes Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
