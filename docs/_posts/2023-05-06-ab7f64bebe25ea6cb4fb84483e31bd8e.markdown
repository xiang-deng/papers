Abstract Knowledge graphs (KGs) are intrinsically incomplete. Knowledge representation learning methods deal with embedding components of a knowledge graph (ie, entities and relations) into a low-dimensional vector space with the aim of predicting the missing links. The KG Embedding models use gradient descent-based optimization techniques to optimize their parameters, but they suffer from late convergence, making them inefficient for dynamic knowledge graphs.
