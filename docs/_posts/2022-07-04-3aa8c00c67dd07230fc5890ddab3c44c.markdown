Abstract Vision-language-navigation (VLN) is a challenging task that requires a robot to autonomously move to a destination based on visual observation following a human s natural language instructions. To improve the performance and generalization ability, the pre-training model based on the transformer is used instead of the traditional methods. However, the pre-training model is not suitable for sustainable computing and practical application because of its complex …
