Recent advancements in deep learning have precipitated the emergence of large language models (LLMs) which exhibit an impressive aptitude for understanding and producing text akin to human language. Despite the ability to train highly capable LLMs, the methodology for maintaining their relevancy and rectifying errors remains elusive. To that end, the past few years have witnessed a surge in techniques for editing LLMs, the objective of which is to alter the behavior of LLMs within a specific Cites: PaLM 2 Technical Report
