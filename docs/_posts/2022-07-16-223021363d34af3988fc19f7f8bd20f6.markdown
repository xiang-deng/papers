Abstract Machine-generated text presents a potential threat not only to the public sphere, but also to the scientific enterprise, whereby genuine research is undermined by convincing, synthetic text. In this paper we examine the problem of detecting GPT-2-generated technical research text. We first consider the realistic scenario where the defender does not have full information about the adversary s text generation pipeline, but is able to label small amounts of in-domain genuine and Cites: Neural deepfake detection with factual structure of text
