Zero-shot text classification is a widely studied task that deals with a lack of annotated data. The most common approach is to reformulate it as a textual entailment problem, enabling classification into unseen classes. This work explores an effective approach that trains on a weakly supervised dataset generated from traditional classification data. We empirically study the relation between the performance of the entailment task, which is used as a proxy, and the target zero …
