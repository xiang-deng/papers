This research report introduces ElegansNet, a neural network that mimics real-world neuronal network circuitry, with the goal of better understanding the interplay between connectome topology and deep learning systems. The proposed approach utilizes the powerful representational capabilities of living beings neuronal circuitry to design and generate improved deep learning systems with a topology similar to natural networks. The Caenorhabditis elegans connectome is used as a reference  Cites: Efficientnetv2: Smaller models and faster training
