At present, the target of interest in visual tracking is given in the form of a bounding box. Due to the randomness of the target shape, the bounding box may contain a lot of nontarget information. When encountering complex tracking scenarios, the performance of the tracker reduces severely. To address this problem, in this letter, the authors propose a novel tracking framework based on the joint of the visual template and natural language (VNTrack) to alleviate the impact of bounding box Cites: Roberta: A robustly optimized bert pretraining approach
