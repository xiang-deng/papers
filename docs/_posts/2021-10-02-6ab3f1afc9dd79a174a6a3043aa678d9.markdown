To build increasingly general-purpose artificial intelligence systems that can deal with unknown variables across unknown domains, we need benchmarks that measure precisely how well these systems perform on tasks they have never seen before. A prerequisite for this is a measure of a task s generalization difficulty, or how dissimilar it is from the system s prior knowledge and experience. If the skill of an intelligence system in a particular domain is defined as it s ability to consistently Cites: Codebleu: a method for automatic evaluation of code synthesis
