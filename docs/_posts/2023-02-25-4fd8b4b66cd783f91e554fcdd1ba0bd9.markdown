Are there structures underlying student work that are universal across every open-ended task? We demonstrate that, across many subjects and assignment types, the probability distribution underlying student-generated open-ended work is close to Zipf s Law. Inferring this latent structure for classroom assignments can help learning analytics researchers, instruction designers, and educators understand the landscape of various student approaches, assess the complexity of assignments Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
