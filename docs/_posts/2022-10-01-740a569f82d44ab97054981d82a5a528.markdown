Growing populations require increased food production through increasing yields and expanding land use. Thus, agricultural production has a dialectical relationship with natural resource conservation. South America has been the recent site of both intensification and areal expansion of crop production. The presented study investigates the dynamics of land use and land cover (LULC) in Mato Grosso state at two-year intervals for an 18-year period consisting of the 2000/01 and 2017/18 crop  Cites: Google fusion tables: data management, integration and
