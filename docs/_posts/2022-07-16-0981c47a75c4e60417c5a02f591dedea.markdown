Casting session-based or sequential recommendation as reinforcement learning (RL) through reward signals is a promising research direction towards recommender systems (RS) that maximize cumulative profits. However, the direct use of RL algorithms in the RS setting is impractical due to challenges like off-policy training, huge action spaces and lack of sufficient reward signals. Recent RL approaches for RS attempt to tackle these challenges by combining RL and (self-) supervised  Cites: Multiobjective pareto-efficient approaches for recommender systems
