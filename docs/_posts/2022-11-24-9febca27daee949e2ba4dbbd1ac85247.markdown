Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to learn powerful representations to benefit various artificial intelligence applications, such as question answering and recommendations. Meanwhile, contrastive learning (CL), as an effective mechanism to enhance the discriminative capacity of the learned representations, has been leveraged in different fields, especially graph-based models. However, since the structures of knowledge graphs (KGs) are usually more complicated compared to  Cites: Lego: Latent execution-guided reasoning for multi-hop question
