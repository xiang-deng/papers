Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) has been an active research topic in recent years, which is the task of predicting missing links based on known triples of knowledge graphs. Some recent work has shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) using graph structure can perform well on KGC. These models learn information from entities and relations within the subject s neighborhood and update the representation through a message passing mechanism. However, existing GNN Cites: Open information extraction from the web
