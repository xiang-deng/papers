Text mining techniques have demonstrated their effectiveness for stock market prediction and different text feature representation approaches,(eg, TF-IDF and word embedding), have been adapted to extract textual information from financial news sources. In addition, different machine learning techniques including deep learning have been employed to construct the prediction models. Various combinations of text feature representations and learning models have been applied for stock prediction Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
