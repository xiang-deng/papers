We explore data-driven rule aggregation based on latent feature representations in the context of knowledge graph completion. For a given query and a collection of rules obtained by a symbolic rule learning system, we propose end-to-end trainable aggregation functions for combining the rules into a confidence score answering the query. Despite using latent feature representations for rules, the proposed models remain fully interpretable in terms of the underlying symbolic approach.
