Computational fact checking,(given a textual claim and a table, verify if the claim holds wrt the given data) and data-to-text generation (given a subset of cells, produce a sentence describing them) exploit the relationship between relational data and natural language text. Despite promising results in these areas, state-of-the-art solutions simply fail in managing “data-ambiguity , ie, the case when there are multiple interpretations of the relationship between the textual sentence and the …
