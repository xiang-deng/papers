Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a classic fine-grained approach that aims to distinguish sentiment polarities towards a particular aspect target. The majority of research on this topic has been devoted to constructing syntax-based graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for context feature vectors. These approaches perform poorly in terms of node representation and capturing long-distance dependency. In this paper, we focus on the ability of graph convolution and propose Cites: Aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network
