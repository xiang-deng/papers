Labeling textual corpora in their entirety is infeasible in most practical situations, yet it is a very common need today in public and private organizations. In contexts with large unlabeled datasets, active learning methods may reduce the manual labeling effort by selecting samples deemed more informative for the learning process. The paper elaborates on a method for multi-class classification based on state-of-the-art NLP active learning techniques, performing various experiments in low-resource and  Cites: Extracting databases from dark data with deepdive
