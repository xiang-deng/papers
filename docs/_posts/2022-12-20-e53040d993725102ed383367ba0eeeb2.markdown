Implementing human-level reasoning about action effects is an important competence for a cognitive agent: given precondition and action descriptions, a system should be able to infer the change in the physical world that the action causes. In this work, we propose a new action-effect prediction task. We explore few-shot learning with large pre-trained language models based on a limited number of samples and propose task-relevant ontology knowledge (from KnowRob ontology)  Cites: PIGLeT: Language grounding through neuro-symbolic interaction
