Heterogeneous graph neural networks can represent information of heterogeneous graphs with excellent ability. Recently, self-supervised learning manner is researched which learns the unique expression of a graph through a contrastive learning method. In the absence of labels, this learning methods show great potential. However, contrastive learning relies heavily on positive and negative pairs, and generating high-quality pairs from heterogeneous graphs is difficult.
