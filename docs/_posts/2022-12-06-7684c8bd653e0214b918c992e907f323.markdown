Solid transportation problem mainly deals with the situation of optimizing different objective functions related to many industrial problems considering constraints sets and due to the constraints uncertainty is always present in different parameters of solid transportation problems. This chapter intends to present a comprehensive study on the development of a mathematical model for solid transportation problems considering uncertain parameters and the neutrosophic fuzzy numbers are used to …
