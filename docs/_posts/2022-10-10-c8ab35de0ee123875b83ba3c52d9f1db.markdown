Characterizing the implicit structure of the computation within neural networks is a foundational problem in the area of deep learning interpretability. Can their inner decision process be captured symbolically in some familiar logic? We show that any transformer neural network can be translated into an equivalent fixed-size first-order logic formula which may also use majority quantifiers. The idea is to simulate transformers with highly uniform threshold circuits and leverage known theoretical  Cites: Xi Victoria Lin, Todor Mihaylov, Myle Ott, Sam Shleifer, Kurt
