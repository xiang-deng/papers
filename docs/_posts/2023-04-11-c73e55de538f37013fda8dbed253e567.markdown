A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a widely used deep-learning network for dealing with sequential data. Imitating a dynamical system, an infinite-width RNN can approximate any open dynamical system in a compact domain. In general, deep narrow networks with bounded width and arbitrary depth are more effective than wide shallow networks with arbitrary width and bounded depth in practice; however, the universal approximation theorem for deep narrow structures has yet to be Cites: Coatnet: Marrying convolution and attention for all data sizes
