Abstract Pre-trained Language Models (LMs) have advanced a range of semantic tasks, and have also shown promise for factual knowledge extraction encoded in them. Although several works have explored this ability in the LM probing setting, viability of knowledge base construction from LMs has not yet been explored. In light of this, we hosted the LM-KBC challenge at the 21st International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2022). Participants were asked to build actual knowledge bases Cites: REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training
