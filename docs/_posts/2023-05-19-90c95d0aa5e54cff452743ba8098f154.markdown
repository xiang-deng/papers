Measuring the distance between machine-produced and human language is acritical open problem. Inspired by empirical findings from psycholinguistics on theperiodicity of entropy in language, we propose FACE, a set of metrics based onFourier Analysis of the estimated Cross-Entropy of language, for measuring thesimilarity between model-generated and human-written languages. Based on anopen-ended generation task and the experimental data from previous studies, weind that FACE …
