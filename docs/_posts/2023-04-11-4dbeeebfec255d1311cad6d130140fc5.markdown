Fingerprint recognition is a widely adopted biometric authentication method that leverages the unique characteristics of fingerprints to identify individuals. Its applications range from access control and authentication to forensic science, making the development of a robust, precise, and secure model for fingerprint recognition and analysis of paramount importance. Recently, deep learning and machine learning models have shown promise in this field, however, the use of these Cites: Thieves on Sesame Street! Model Extraction of BERT-based APIs
