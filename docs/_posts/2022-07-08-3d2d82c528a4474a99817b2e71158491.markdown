Resource recommendation is extremely challenging under low-resource conditions because representation learning models require sufficient triplets for their training, and the presence of massive long-tail resources leads to data sparsity and cold-start problems. In this paper, an industrial knowledge graph is developed to integrate resources for manufacturing enterprises, and we further formulate long-tail recommendations as a few-shot relational learning problem of learning-to Cites: Adapting Meta Knowledge Graph Information for Multi-Hop
