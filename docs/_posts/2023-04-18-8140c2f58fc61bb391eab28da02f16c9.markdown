Artificial networks have been studied through the prism of statistical mechanics as disordered systems since the 80s, starting from the simple models of Hopfield s associative memory and the single-neuron perceptron classifier. Assuming data is generated by a teacher model, asymptotic generalisation predictions were originally derived using the replica method and the online learning dynamics has been described in the large system limit. In this chapter, we review the key original ideas of Cites: Identifying and attacking the saddle point problem in high
