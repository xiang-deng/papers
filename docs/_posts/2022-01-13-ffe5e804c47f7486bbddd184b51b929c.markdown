Open source code repositories provide massive data as programs that have been used to develop different tools. These kinds of works have been included in the active Big Code and Mining Software Repositories research fields. Although different machine learning works already classify the syntactic constructs used by programmers, there are no reports about the most common syntactic patterns used by Java programmers. In this article, we describe a system we build to provide such a Cites: Learning python code suggestion with a sparse pointer network
