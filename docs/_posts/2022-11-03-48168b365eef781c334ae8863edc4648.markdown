As complicated microcosms, lakes have been attracting exponentially increasing attention, resulting in plentiful interdisciplinary academic publications of more than 10 5. It is thereby challengeable to explore the massive unstructured text information of publications to understand lake topics from the global-and centurial-scale perspectives. However, conventional bibliometrics suffer from the limitations of non-understanding the literature.
