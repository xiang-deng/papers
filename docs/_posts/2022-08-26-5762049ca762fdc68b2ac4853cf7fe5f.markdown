Natural language interfaces to databases have recently made substantial progress due to advances in machine learning. Users no longer need technical knowledge to search for insights in their database. However, research is largely focused on increasing the one-shot accuracy, instead of building systems that interact with and guide a user s search. In this demo, we present Veezoo, an AI-powered data analytics platform that enables users to directly talk to their databases. Cites: Xi Victoria Lin, Bailin Wang, Yi Chern Tan, Xinyi Yang, Dragomir
