This thesis concerns sample-efficient embodied machine learning. Machine learning success in sequential decision problems has been limited to domains with a narrow range of goals, requiring orders more experience than humans. Additionally, they lack the ability to generalise to new related goals. In contrast, humans are continual learners. Given their embodiment and computational constraints, humans are forced to reuse knowledge (compressed abstractions of repeated structures present across …
