In recent years we have witnessed a renewed interest in machine learning methodologies, especially for deep representation learning, that could overcome basic iid assumptions and tackle non-stationary environments subject to various distributional shifts or sample selection biases. Within this context, several computational approaches based on architectural priors, regularizers and replay policies have been proposed with different degrees of success depending on the Cites: Learn to grow: A continual structure learning framework for
