Urban traffic data plays an important role in urban transportation planning. Due to the scarcity of real-life urban traffic data, many transportation planning applications need to generate synthesized traffic flows based on the real-life trajectory datasets. However, those synthesized traffic flows can only fit the input trajectories, which are static and does not reflect the real traffic distributions. In this paper, we use a stochastic origin-destination (OD) matrix to represent the density of the dynamic … Cites: ‪On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: Encoder …‬
