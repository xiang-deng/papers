Document retrieval is a core component of many knowledge-intensive natural language processing task formulations such as fact verification and question answering. Sources of textual knowledge, such as Wikipedia articles, condition the generation of answers from the models. Recent advances in retrieval use sequence-to-sequence models to incrementally predict the title of the appropriate Wikipedia page given a query. However, this method requires supervision in the form of human …
