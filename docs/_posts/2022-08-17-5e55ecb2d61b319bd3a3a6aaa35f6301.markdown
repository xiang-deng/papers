With the advent of big data across multiple high-impact applications, we are often facing the challenge of complex heterogeneity. The newly collected data usually consist of multiple modalities and are characterized with multiple labels, thus exhibiting the co-existence of multiple types of heterogeneity. Although state-of-the-art techniques are good at modeling the complex heterogeneity with sufficient label information, such label information can be quite expensive to obtain in real Cites: Spectral clustering and transductive learning with multiple views
