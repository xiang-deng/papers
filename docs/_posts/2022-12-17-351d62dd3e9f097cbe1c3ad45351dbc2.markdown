Machine reading comprehension (MRC) is a challenging task in natural language processing that demonstrates the language understanding of the machine. An approach to tackle this challenge requires the machine to answer the question about the given context when needed and abstain from answering when there is no answer. Recent works attempted to solve this challenge with various comprehensive neural network architectures for sequences such as SAN, U-Net, EQuANt, and others  Cites: DROP: A Reading Comprehension Benchmark Requiring Discrete
