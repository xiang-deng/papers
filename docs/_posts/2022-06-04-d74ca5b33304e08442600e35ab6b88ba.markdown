Weakly supervised object detection which reduces the need for strong supersivison during training has recently made significant achievements. However, it remains a challenging issue due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive problems in application. To further reduce the label cost, we introduce a new fusion method of weakly supervised learning and active learning in a unied framework for object detection. Weakly supervised learning based on min-entropy latent model is used to Cites: Margin-based active learning for structured output spaces
