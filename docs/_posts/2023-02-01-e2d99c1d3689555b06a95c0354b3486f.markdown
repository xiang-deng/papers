Understanding the rules of grammar and linguistic features is essential to understanding the context of a language, which helps to understand that language. Similarly, for Natural Language processing, the linguistic feature allows understanding of the language. This paper introduced how Coreference, Word-sense, and Semantic knowledge (CWS) of linguistic features work. It would improve the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Processing  Cites: End-to-end Neural Coreference Resolution
