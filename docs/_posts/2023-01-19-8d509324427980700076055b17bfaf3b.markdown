摇In multi 鄄hop inference models, path information is formed by fully mining and utilizing multi 鄄step relationships between entities in the knowledge graph to accomplish knowledge inference. To solve the problems of sparse data and low reliability of inference paths in most of the existing sparse knowledge graph multi 鄄hop inference models, a multi 鄄hop inference model for knowledge graphs incorporating semantic information is proposed. Firstly, entities and relations in the …
