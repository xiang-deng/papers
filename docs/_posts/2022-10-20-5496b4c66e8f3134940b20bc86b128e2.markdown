Code comment is important to facilitate code comprehension for developers. Recent studies suggest to generate comments automatically with deep learning, in particular, based on neural machine translation models. However, such a promising Neural Comment Generation (NCG) technique suffers from unsatisfactory performance, as well as poor usability, ie, developers cannot easily understand and modify the auto-generated comments. This paper suggests that a proper …
