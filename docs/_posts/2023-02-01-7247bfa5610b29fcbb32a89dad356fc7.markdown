Artificial learners often behave differently from human learners in the context of neural agent-based simulations of language emergence and change. The lack of appropriate cognitive biases in these learners is one of the prevailing explanations. However, it has also been proposed that more naturalistic settings of language learning and use could lead to more human-like results. In this work, we investigate the latter account focusing on the word-order/case-marking trade-off, a widely Cites: Compositionality and capacity in emergent languages
