Transformer-based autoregressive (AR) methods have achieved appealing performance for varied sequence-to-sequence generation tasks, eg, neural machine translation, summarization, and code generation, but suffer from low inference efficiency. To speed up the inference stage, many non-autoregressive (NAR) strategies have been proposed in the past few years. Among them, the conditional masked language model (CMLM) is one of the most versatile frameworks, as it can  Cites: Don t give me the details, just the summary! topic-aware
