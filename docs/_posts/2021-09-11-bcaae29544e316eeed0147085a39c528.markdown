An individual s variation in writing style is often a function of both social and personal attributes. While structured social variation has been extensively studied, eg, gender based variation, far less is known about how to characterize individual styles due to their idiosyncratic nature. We introduce a new approach to studying idiolects through a massive cross-author comparison to identify and encode stylistic features. The neural model achieves strong performance at authorship identification on short texts Cites: Linguistic regularities in continuous space word representations
