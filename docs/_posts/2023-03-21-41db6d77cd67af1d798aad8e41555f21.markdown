We develop a new model for automatic extraction of reported measurements from the astrophysical literature, utilising modern Natural Language Processing techniques. We begin with a rules-based model for keyword-search-based extraction, and then proceed to develop artificial neural network models for full entity and relation extraction from free text. This process also requires the creation of hand-annotated datasets selected from the available astrophysical literature for training and …
