In this paper, we introduce four main novelties: First, we present a new way of handling the topology problem of normalizing flows. Second, we describe a technique to enforce certain classes of boundary conditions onto normalizing flows. Third, we introduce the I-Spline bijection, which, similar to previous work, leverages splines but, in contrast to those works, can be made arbitrarily often differentiable. And finally, we use these techniques to create Waveflow, an Ansatz for the one  Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
