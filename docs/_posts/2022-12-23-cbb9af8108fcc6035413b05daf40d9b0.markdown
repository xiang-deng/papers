Machine-Generated Text (MGT) detection, a task that discriminates MGT from Human-Written Text (HWT), plays a crucial role in preventing misuse of text generative models, which excel in mimicking human writing style recently. Latest proposed detectors usually take coarse text sequence as input and output some good results by fine-tune pretrained models with standard cross-entropy loss. However, these methods fail to consider the linguistic aspect of text (eg, coherence) and sentence  Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
