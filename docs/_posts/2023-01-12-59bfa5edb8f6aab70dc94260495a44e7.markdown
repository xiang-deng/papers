This work proposes a rapid and robust machine-learning model to predict the volumetric error of a five-axis machine tool. For this purpose, several machine learning modelswhich are MultiOutput regression, Chained MultiOutput regression, Linear regression, SVM regression, XGB regression and ANN regressionhave been selected, and their performances were compared to other models in the literature and to one another to find the best model for the problem at hand.
