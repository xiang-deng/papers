Most existing works on cardiac echocardiography segmentation require a large number of ground-truth labels to appropriately train a neural network; this, however, is time consuming and laborious for physicians. Self-supervision learning is one of the potential solutions to address this challenge by deeply exploiting the raw data. However, existing works mainly exploit single type/level of pretext task. In this work, we propose fusion of the multi-level and multi-type self-generated knowledge. We  Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
