While self-supervised learning techniques are often used to mine hidden knowledge from unlabeled data via modeling multiple views, it is unclear how to perform effective representation learning in a complex and inconsistent context. To this end, we propose a new multi-view self-supervised learning method, namely consistency and complementarity network (CoCoNet), to comprehensively learn global inter-view consistent and local cross-view complementarity-preserving representations from …
