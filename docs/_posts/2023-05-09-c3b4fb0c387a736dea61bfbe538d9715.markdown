Sentiment analysis is a powerful approach for processing, analysing, speculating, and summarising unstructured content to convert it into reliable information. With the increasing demand for sentiment analysis in real-life applications, new discriminate machine learning and natural language processing techniques have been introduced in past years. However, the deep neural network is an emerging approach that learns by multiple layer feature dimensions of data and predicts Cites: Adaptive recursive neural network for target-dependent twitter
