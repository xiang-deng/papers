Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNNs) with their ability to generate highresolution images from low-resolution counterparts, exacerbate the privacy concerns emerging from automated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-based image classifiers. In this work, we hypothesize and empirically show that adversarial examples learned over CNN image classifiers can survive processing by SRCNNs and lead them to generate poor quality images that are hard to classify …
