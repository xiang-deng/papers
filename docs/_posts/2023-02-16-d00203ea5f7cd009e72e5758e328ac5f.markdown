Tensors, also known as multidimensional arrays, are useful data structures in machine learning and statistics. In recent years, Bayesian methods have emerged as a popular direction for analyzing tensor-valued data since they provide a convenient way to introduce sparsity into the model and conduct uncertainty quantification. In this article, we provide an overview of frequentist and Bayesian methods for solving tensor completion and regression problems, with a focus on Bayesian methods.
