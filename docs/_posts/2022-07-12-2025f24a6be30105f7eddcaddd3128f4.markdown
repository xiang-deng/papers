Abstract Concept drift is a phenomenon that commonly happened in data streams and need to be detected, because it means the statistical properties of a target variable, which the model is trying to predict, change over time in an unseen way. Most current detection methods are based on a hypothesis test framework. As a result, in these detection methods, a hypothesis test is need to be set, and more importantly, cannot obtain the type of drift. The setting of a hypothesis test requires an …
