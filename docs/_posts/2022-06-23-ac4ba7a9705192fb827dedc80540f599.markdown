Currently, computer vision technology has been applied to detect and recognize pests for integrated pest management (IPM). Recent studies have shown that the accuracy of pest detection and recognition has been rapidly improved with the development of deep learning. However, complex backgrounds, various poses, and different scales among insect species in the field will aggravate the difficulty of pest detection. To address the pest detection and recognition problem in wild field, in this Cites: Randaugment: Practical automated data augmentation with a
