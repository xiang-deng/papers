Graph-based recommender systems (GBRSs) have achieved promising performance by incorporating the user-item bipartite graph using the Graph Neural Network (GNN). Among GBRSs, the information from each user and item s multi-hop neighbours is effectively conveyed between nodes through neighbourhood aggregation and message passing. Although effective, existing neighbourhood information aggregation and passing functions are usually computationally Cites: So, and Quoc V Le. Pay attention to mlps
