In order for AI to be safely deployed in real-world scenarios such as hospitals, schools, and the workplace, it must be able to robustly reason about the physical world. Fundamental to this reasoning is physical common sense: understanding the physical properties and affordances of available objects, how they can be manipulated, and how they interact with other objects. Physical commonsense reasoning is fundamentally a multi-sensory task, since physical properties are Cites: Merlot reserve: Neural script knowledge through vision and
