Autonomous vehicles need to have the ability to predict the future behaviour of surrounding vehicles, which helps with proper trajectory planning and tracking. Many behaviour prediction methods have limited application because they have a very limited prediction horizon. This paper proposes a deep learning‐based hybrid model for behaviour prediction over long‐time periods, including manoeuvre recognition and a behaviour prediction module. In manoeuvre recognition module, the CNN …
