In the past few years, the fast-developing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and their broad applications have served as the primary driving horsepower for a new technology wave. However, they are still very computationally intensive for resource-constrained mobile systems. Therefore, a lot of research works were proposed to compress and accelerate DNNs for efficient computation on mobile devices.
