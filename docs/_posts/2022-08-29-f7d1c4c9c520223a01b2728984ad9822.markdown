Commonly used nested entity recognition methods are span-based entity recognition methods, which focus on learning the head and tail representations of entities. This method lacks obvious boundary supervision, which leads to the failure of the correct candidate entities to be predicted, resulting in the problem of high precision and low recall. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a named entity recognition method based on multi-task learning and biaffine mechanism, introduces the idea of Cites: A General Framework for Information Extraction using Dynamic
