Deep learning (DL)-based de novo molecular design has recently gained considerable traction. Many DL-based generative models have been successfully developed to design novel molecules, but most of them are ligand-centric and the role of the 3D geometries of target binding pockets in molecular generation has not been well-exploited. Here, we proposed a new 3D-based generative model called RELATION. In the RELATION model, the BiTL algorithm was specifically designed to …
