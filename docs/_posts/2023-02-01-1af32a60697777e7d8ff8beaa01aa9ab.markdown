Prompting approaches have been recently explored in text style transfer, where a textual prompt is used to query a pretrained language model to generate style-transferred texts word by word in an autoregressive manner. However, such a generation process is less controllable and early prediction errors may affect future word predictions. In this paper, we present a prompt-based editing approach for text style transfer. Specifically, we prompt a pretrained language model for style  Cites: Reformulating Unsupervised Style Transfer as Paraphrase
