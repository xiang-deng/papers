Computational notebooks such as Jupyter Notebook have become data scientists  de facto programming environments. Many visualization researchers and practitioners have developed interactive visualization tools that support notebooks. However, little is known about the appropriate design of visual analytics (VA) tools in notebooks. To bridge this critical research gap, we investigate the design strategies in this space by analyzing 159 notebook VA tools and their users  feedback. Our analysis …
