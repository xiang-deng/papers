Text matching is one of the fundamental research tasks in the field of natural language processing. It can be applied to a large number of NLP tasks, such as information retrieval, question, and answer systems and text repetition. In this paper, we propose a text-matching model with multi-granularity term alignment (MGTA). The model extracts word information at different granularities through convolutional neural networks and enhances the model effect by aligning the original location  Cites: Calibration of Pre-trained Transformers
