Domain Generalization (DG) aims to learn a model that can generalize well to unseen target domains from a set of source domains. With the idea of invariant causal mechanism, a lot of efforts have been put into learning robust causal effects which are determined by the object yet insensitive to the domain changes. Despite the invariance of causal effects, they are difficult to be quantified and optimized. Inspired by the ability that humans adapt to new environments by prior knowledge Cites: Distributionally robust neural networks for group shifts: On the
