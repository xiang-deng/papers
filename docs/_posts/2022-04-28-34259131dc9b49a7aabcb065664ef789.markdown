Several age predictors based on DNA methylation, dubbed epigenetic clocks, have been created in recent years, with the vast majority based on regularized linear regression. This study explores the improvement in the performance and interpretation of epigenetic clocks using deep learning. First, we gathered 142 publicly available data sets from several human tissues to develop AltumAge, a neural network framework that is a highly accurate and precise age predictor Cites: Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate
