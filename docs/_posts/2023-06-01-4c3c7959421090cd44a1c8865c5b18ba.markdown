Paraphrase generation is a long-standing task in natural language processing (NLP). Supervised paraphrase generation models, which rely on human-annotated paraphrase pairs, are cost-inefficient and hard to scale up. On the other hand, automatically annotated paraphrase pairs (eg, by machine back-translation), usually suffer from the lack of syntactic diversity--the generated paraphrase sentences are very similar to the source sentences in terms of syntax. In this work, we present …
