The attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models are increasingly used in handwritten mathematical expression recognition (HMER) tasks. Given the recent success of Transformer in computer vision and a variety of attempts to combine Transformer with convolutional neural network (CNN), in this paper, we study 3 ways of leveraging Transformer and CNN designs to improve AED-based HMER models: 1) Tandem way, which feeds CNN-extracted features to a Transformer encoder to  Cites: Coatnet: Marrying convolution and attention for all data sizes
