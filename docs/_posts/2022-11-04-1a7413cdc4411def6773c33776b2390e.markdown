The majority of work at the intersection of computational linguistics and natural language processing aims to show, process by process, that human linguistic behavior (and knowledge) is reducible to a simple learning objective (eg, predicting the next word) applied to unstructured linguistic data (eg, written data). This dissertation uses three test cases to show concrete instances where current reductionist approaches fall short of human linguistic knowledge. In the first case …
