Entity alignment aims to identify equivalent entity pairs from different knowledge graphs (KGs). Recently, aligning temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) that contain time information has aroused increasingly more interest, as the time dimension is widely used in real-life applications. The matching between TKGs requires seed entity pairs, which are lacking in practice. Hence, it is of great significance to study TKG alignment under scarce supervision. In this work, the authors formally formulate  Cites: Iterative Entity Alignment via Joint Knowledge Embeddings
