A sensitizer-focused study towards optimizing dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) performance under both solar and indoor light sources was performed. After the electrolyte optimization step, the next step for our pan-illumination strategy involved investigation of the effects of different sensitizers under radically different light sources. Selected sensitizers were studied under both simulated solar and indoor fluorescent light sources, using DSSCs employing the pan-illumination tailored Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
