One of the challenges faced by conversational agents is their inability to identify unstated presumptions of their users commands, a task trivial for humans due to their common sense. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot commonsense reasoning system for conversational agents in an attempt to achieve this. Our reasoner uncovers unstated presumptions from user commands satisfying a general template of if-(state), then-(action), because-(goal). Our reasoner uses a state-of-the-art Cites: Dialog-to-action: Conversational question answering over a large
