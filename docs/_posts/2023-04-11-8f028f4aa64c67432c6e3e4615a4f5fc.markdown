Federated learning (FL) has been widely applied to collaboratively train deep learning (DL) models on massive end devices (ie, clients). Due to the limited storage capacity and high labeling cost, the data on each client may be insufficient for model training. Conversely, in cloud datacenters, there exist large-scale unlabeled data, which are easy to collect from public access (eg, social media). Herein, we propose the Ada-FedSemi system, which leverages both on-device labeled data and in-cloud Cites: A closer look at deep learning heuristics: Learning rate restarts
