We present the Frame-based ontology Design Outlet (FrODO), a novel method and tool for drafting ontologies from competency questions automatically. Competency questions are expressed as natural language and are a common solution for representing requirements in a number of agile ontology engineering methodologies, such as the eXtreme Design (XD) or SAMOD. FrODO builds on top of FRED. In fact, it leverages the frame semantics for drawing domain-relevant Cites: Machine Reading.
