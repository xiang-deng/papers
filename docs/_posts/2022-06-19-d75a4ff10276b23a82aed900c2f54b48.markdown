Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as promising physical adsorbents for hydrogen storage due to their high porosity and structural tunability. We selected 7643 real MOFs from the computation-ready MOF 2019 database to screen high-performance materials for hydrogen storage based on the grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. Based on the obtained data set, we proposed a deep learning classification model powered by the crystal graph Cites: Theoretical limits of hydrogen storage in metalorganic
