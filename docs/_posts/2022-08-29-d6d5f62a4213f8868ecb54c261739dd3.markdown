Tables are widely used in several types of documents since they can bring important information in a structured way. In scientific papers, tables can sum up novel discoveries and summarize experimental results, making the research comparable and easily understandable by scholars. Several methods perform table analysis working on document images, losing useful information during the conversion from the PDF files since OCR tools can be prone to recognition errors, in particular for text  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
