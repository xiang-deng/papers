Neural document ranking models perform impressively well due to superior language understanding gained from pre-training tasks. However, due to their complexity and large number of parameters, these (typically transformer-based) models are often non-interpretable in that ranking decisions can not be clearly attributed to specific parts of the input documents. In this paper we propose ranking models that are inherently interpretable by generating explanations as a by-product Cites: Convolutional Neural Networks for Soft-Matching N-Grams in Ad
