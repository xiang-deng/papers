Recently, hyperbolic embedding has successfully demonstrated its superiority over Euclidean analogues in representing hierarchical data. As the scale-free network that usually exhibits rich hierarchical structures, knowledge graphs naturally become a field where hyperbolic embedding shows its talents. Furthermore, hyperbolic embedding is also an expected solution to comprehensively reproduce the semantic features and underlying structures of KGs in the embedding space, which will …
