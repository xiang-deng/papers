In recent years, significant progress has been made in text generation. The latest text generation models are revolutionizing the domain by generating human-like text. It has gained wide popularity recently in many domains like news, social networks, movie script writing, poetry composition, to name a few. The application of text generation in various fields has resulted in a lot of interest from the scientific community in this area. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of extensive Cites: Genie: A leaderboard for human-in-the-loop evaluation of text
