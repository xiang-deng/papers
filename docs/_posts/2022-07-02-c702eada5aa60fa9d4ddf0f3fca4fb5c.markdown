The condition monitoring of bearing by using vibration signal is an indispensable mission in today s manufacture processes. To develop the solution for monitoring the conditions of the bearing, signal processing plays a crucial role for finding out the meaningful information from the vibration signals. The existing signal processing approach present in the current literature mainly focuses on extracting the meaningful information from the bandwidths which contains the fault frequencies Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
