When it is difficult to verify contributed solutions in mobile crowdsourcing, the majority voting mechanism is widely utilized to incentivize distributed workers to provide high- quality and truthful solutions. In the majority voting mechanism, a worker is rewarded based on whether his solution is consistent with the majority. However, most prior related work relies on a strong assumption that workers solution accuracy levels are public knowledge, which may not hold in many practical scenarios. We relax such an Cites: Spectral methods meet EM: A provably optimal algorithm for
