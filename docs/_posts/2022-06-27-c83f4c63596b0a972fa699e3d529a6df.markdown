View Journal| View Issue reports were included aiming to showcase the robust photovoltaic performance of large-area perovskite solar modules in a variety of device configurations, hence providing a brief overview of the role of stateof-the-art scalable precursor ink development in transforming unstable lab-sized solar cells into robust, low-cost perovskite solar cell technology that can be scaled up to cover much larger areas.
