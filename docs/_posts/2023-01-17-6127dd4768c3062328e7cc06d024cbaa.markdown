The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can generate samples similar to the original data to solve the problem of fault sample imbalance in planetary gearbox fault diagnosis. Most of models rely heavily on convolution to model the dependencies across feature vectors of vibration signals. However, the characterization ability of convolution operator is limited by the size of convolution kernel and it cannot capture the long-distance dependence in the original data. In …
