As deep learning methods have obtained tremendous success over the years, our understanding of these models has yet to keep up with the development the models. Explainable machine learning is one of the main research fields dedicated to understanding complex machine learning models. While there are ever-increasing proposed instances of explanations, the evaluation of explanations has been an open question. Evaluations involving humans are expensive in the development …
