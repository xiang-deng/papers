Many machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Most existing approaches focused on making EEG-based BCIs more accurate, but few have considered their security. Recent studies have shown that EEG-based BCIs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To our knowledge, there is no study on adversarial defenses in EEG-based BCIs. This paper, for the first time, explores multiple classical  Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
