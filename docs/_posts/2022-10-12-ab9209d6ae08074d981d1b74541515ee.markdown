Vibration measurement and monitoring are essential in a wide variety of applications. Vibration measurements are critical for diagnosing industrial machinery malfunctions because they provide information about the condition of the rotating equipment. Vibration analysis is considered the most effective method for predictive maintenance because it is used to troubleshoot instantaneous faults as well as periodic maintenance. Numerous studies conducted in this vein have been  Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
