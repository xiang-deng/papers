Proteins maintain the functional order of cell in life by interacting with other proteins. Determination of protein complex structural information gives biological insights for the research of diseases and drugs. Recently, a breakthrough has been made in protein monomer structure prediction. However, due to the limited number of the known protein structure and homologous sequences of complexes, the prediction of residue–residue contacts on hetero-dimer interfaces is still a challenge. In this study …
