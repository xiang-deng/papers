Fabric anomaly detection (AD) tries to detect anomalies (ie, defects) in fabrics, and fabric AD approaches are continuously improved with respect to their AD performance. However, developed solutions are known to generalize poorly to previously unseen fabrics, posing a crucial limitation to their applicability. Moreover, current research focuses on adapting converged models to previously unseen fabrics in a post hoc manner, rather than training models that generalize better in the …
