Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the reliable and safe deployment of machine learning systems in the real world. Great progress has been made over the past years. This paper presents the first review of recent advances in OOD detection with a particular focus on natural language processing approaches. First, we provide a formal definition of OOD detection and discuss several related fields. We then categorize recent algorithms into three classes according to the data they Cites: On the effects of transformer size on in-and out-of-domain calibration
