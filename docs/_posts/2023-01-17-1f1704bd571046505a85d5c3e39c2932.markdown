The steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) has been widely used in building multi-target brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalogram (EEG). However, methods for high-accuracy SSVEP systems require training data for each target, which needs significant calibration time. This study aimed to use the data of only part of the targets for training while achieving high classification accuracy on all targets. In this work, we proposed a generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) scheme …
