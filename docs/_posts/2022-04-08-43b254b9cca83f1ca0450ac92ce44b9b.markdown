Neural classifiers are non linear systems providing decisions on the classes of patterns, for a given problem they have learned. The output computed by a classifier for each pattern constitutes an approximation of the output of some unknown function, mapping pattern data to their respective classes. The lack of knowledge of such a function along with the complexity of neural classifiers, especially when these are deep learning architectures, do not permit to obtain information on how specific Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
