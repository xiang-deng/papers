In this paper, we focus on the task of multi-label emotion classification and aim to tackle two problems of this task. First, few studies try to exploit the correlation among different emotions, which motivates us to introduce the task-specific information into the shared hidden layer. Second, the public multi-label emotion datasets for low-resource languages are limited. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel multi-task multi-label emotion classification. Our approach consists of three  Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
