Text-to-SQL parsers map natural language questions to programs that are executable over tables to generate answers, and are typically evaluated on large- scale datasets like SPIDER (Yu et al., 2018). We argue that existing benchmarks fail to capture a certain out-of-domain generalization problem that is of significant practical importance: matching domain specific phrases to composite operations over columns. To study this problem, we propose a synthetic dataset and a re Cites: Meta-Learning for Domain Generalization in Semantic Parsing
