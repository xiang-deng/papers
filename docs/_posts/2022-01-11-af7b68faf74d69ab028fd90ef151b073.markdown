Background Few prognostic prediction models for total knee replacement are available, and the role of radiographic findings in predicting its use remains unclear. We aimed to develop and validate predictive models for total knee replacement and to assess whether adding radiographic findings improves predictive performance. Methods We identified participants with recent knee pain (in the past 3 months) in the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) and the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI).
