One basic goal of artificial learning systems is the ability to continually learn throughout that system s lifetime. Transitioning between tasks and re-deploying prior knowledge is thus a desired feature of artificial learning. However, in the deep-learning approaches, the problem of catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge persists. As a field, we want to solve the catastrophic forgetting problem without requiring exponential computations or time, while demonstrating real-world  Cites: Learn to grow: A continual structure learning framework for
