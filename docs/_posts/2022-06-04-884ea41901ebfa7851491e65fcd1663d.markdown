The world of fluid mechanics is increasingly generating a large amount of data, thanks to the use of numerical simulation techniques. This offers interesting opportunities for incorporating machine learning methods to solve data-related problems such as model calibration. One of the applications that machine learning can offer to the world of Engineering and Fluid Mechanics in particular is the calibration of models making it possible to approximate a phenomenon.
