With the presence of online collaborative tools for software developers, source code is shared and consulted frequently, from code viewers to merge requests and code snippets. Typically, code highlighting quality in such scenarios is sacrificed in favor of system responsiveness. In these on-the-fly settings, performing a formal grammatical analysis of the source code is not only expensive, but also intractable for the many times the input is an invalid derivation of the language. Indeed, current popular Cites: Unsupervised neural machine translation
