Target-aspect-sentiment detection (TASD) task is a vital task for aspect-based sentiment analysis, which aims to detect (target, aspect, sentiment) triples from sentences. However, most of the existing methods do not generate high-quality textual representations and thus produce poor performances on the TASD task. Moreover, how to deal with insufficient high-quality labeled data is also a great challenge. In this paper, we design DPDA, a Dual Prompts-based Data …
