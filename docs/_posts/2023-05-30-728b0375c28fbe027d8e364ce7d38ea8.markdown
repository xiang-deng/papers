Deep neural networks trained using standard cross-entropy loss often induce overfitting of noisy labels that degrades performance. Label correction and contrastive learning have been theoretically demonstrated to be mutually beneficial in noisy label learning. However, the fusion of these two modules in practice has not been researched adequately, and the influence of each module on performance improvement has not been clarified. In this paper, we propose an effective noisy …
