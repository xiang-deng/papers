This book presents the formal definition of fundamental transformations in Category Theory as a mathematical language to be used in Computer Science modelling. The book focuses in particular on models with Global and Internal symmetries (in analogy to Field Theories like Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity). The second part of the book is dedicated to more advanced applications of Category Theory to Computer Science.
