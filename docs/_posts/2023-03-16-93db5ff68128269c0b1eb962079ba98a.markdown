This article introduces DelBERTo, a resource-efficient Transformer architecture for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Transformers replace convolutions and recurrence with the self-attention mechanism and represent the state-of-the-art in NLP. However, self-attention s complexity grows quadratically with the size of the input, which limits their applications. DelBERTo relies on adaptive input and on a deep yet lightweight Transformer architecture to reduce the number of learnable Cites: Delight: Deep and light-weight transformer
