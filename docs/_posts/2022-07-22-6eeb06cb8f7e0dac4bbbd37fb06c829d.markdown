Event temporal relation is capable to detect event evolution and plays an important role in natural language processing. Many recent studies which employ pre-trained language models have shown prominent performance improvement. However, due to more complex context, these approaches usually perform poorly when two events are not within the same sentence. Thus in this paper, we propose a cross-sentence temporal relation extraction model which incorporates the prediction of temporal Cites: TORQUE: A Reading Comprehension Dataset of Temporal
