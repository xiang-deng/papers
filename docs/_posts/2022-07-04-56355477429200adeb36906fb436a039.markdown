When we work in a data lake, data integration is not easy, mainly because the data is usually stored in raw format. Manually performing data integration is a time-consuming task that requires the supervision of a specialist, which can make mistakes or not be able to see the optimal point for data integration among two or more datasets. This paper presents a model to perform heterogeneous in-memory data integration in a Hadoop-based data lake based on a top-k set similarity Cites: The seattle report on database research
