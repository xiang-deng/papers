Mobile apps are indispensable for people s daily life, and automated GUI (Graphical User Interface) testing is widely used for app quality assurance. There is a growing interest in using learning-based techniques for automated GUI testing which aims at generating human-like actions and interactions. However, the limitations such as low testing coverage, weak generalization, and heavy reliance on training data, make an urgent need for a more effective approach to generate human-like actions to Cites: Incoder: A generative model for code infilling and synthesis
