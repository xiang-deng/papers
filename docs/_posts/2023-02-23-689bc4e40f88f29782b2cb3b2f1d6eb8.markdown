Abstract Machine translation (namely MT) has been one of the most popular fields in computational linguistics and Artificial Intelligence (AI). As one of the most promising approaches, MT can potentially break the language barrier of people from all over the world. Despite a number of studies in MT, there are few studies in summarizing and comparing MT methods. To this end, in this paper, we principally focus on presenting the two mainstream MT schemes: statistical machine translation (SMT) …
