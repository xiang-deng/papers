Charge carrier events across organic electronics are ubiquitous, and the derived optimization plays a crucial effect on improving the performance of organic electronics. Herein, a two-dimensional material (Ti3C2T x) is incorporated into titanium dioxide (TiO2) to impart the Ti3C2T x/TiO2 hybrid film enriched hydroxy group distribution, defect-negligible surface, upshifted work function, and enhanced conductivity yet electron mobility versus the pristine TiO2 film. Therefore, intensified Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
