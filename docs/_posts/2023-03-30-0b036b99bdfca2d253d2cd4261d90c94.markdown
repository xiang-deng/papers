Generalization error predictors (GEPs) aim to predict model performance on unseen distributions by deriving dataset-level error estimates from sample-level scores. However, GEPs often utilize disparate mechanisms (eg, regressors, thresholding functions, calibration datasets, etc), to derive such error estimates, which can obfuscate the benefits of a particular scoring function. Therefore, in this work, we rigorously study the effectiveness of popular scoring functions (confidence, local  Cites: Predicting out-of-domain generalization with local manifold
