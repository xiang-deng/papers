With the strong interest in neural network based software engineering approaches and a plethora of proposed solutions, we point out the need for measurement studies in this space. Focusing on a specific application scenario, Java cryptographic API code completion, we outline several potential measurement problems, ranging from embedding design and evaluation, to methodology development of models, and to metrics and benchmarks.
