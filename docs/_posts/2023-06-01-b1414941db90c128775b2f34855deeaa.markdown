Instead of simply matching a query to pre-existing passages, generative retrieval generates identifier strings of passages as the retrieval target. At a cost, the identifier must be distinctive enough to represent a passage. Current approaches use either a numeric ID or a text piece (such as a title or substrings) as the identifier. However, these identifiers cannot cover a passage s content well. As such, we are motivated to propose a new type of identifier, synthetic identifiers, that are generated based on the  Cites: Latent retrieval for weakly supervised open domain question
