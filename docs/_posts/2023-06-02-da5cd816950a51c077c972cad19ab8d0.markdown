Emergent properties have been widely adopted as a term to describe behavior not present in smaller models but observed in larger models. Recent work suggests that the trade-off incurred by quantization is also an emergent property, with sharp drops in performance in models over 6B parameters. In this work, we ask are quantization cliffs in performance solely a factor of scale? Against a backdrop of increased research focus on why certain emergent properties surface at scale, this work Cites: Gpt3. int8 (): 8-bit matrix multiplication for transformers at scale
