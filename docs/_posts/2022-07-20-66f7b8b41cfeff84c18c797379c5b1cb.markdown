Springback is particularly common in metal tube bending, which extremely affects the metal tube axial accuracy. At present, the springback mechanism still remains unclear due to the complex plastic deformation characteristics of metal materials. It is difficult to obtain the accurate axial springback information before bending forming, not to mention formulating a reasonable processing plan to compensate springback. To alleviate this difficulty, a novel optimization framework is constructed which takes Cites: Gated Feedback Recurrent Neural Networks
