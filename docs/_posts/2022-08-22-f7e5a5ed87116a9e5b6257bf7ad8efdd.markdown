Human-AI collaboration for decision-making strives to achieve team performance that exceeds the performance of humans or AI alone. However, many factors can impact success of Human-AI teams, including a user s domain expertise, mental models of an AI system, trust in recommendations, and more. This work examines users interaction with three simulated algorithmic models, all with similar accuracy but different tuning on their true positive and true negative rates.
