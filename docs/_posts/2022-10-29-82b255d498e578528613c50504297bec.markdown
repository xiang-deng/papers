Text classification has been studied for decades as a fundamental task in natural language processing. Deploying classifiers enables more efficient information processing, which is useful for various applications, including decision-making. However, classifiers also present challenging and long-standing problems. As their use increases, expectations about their level of robustness, fairness, accuracy, and other metrics increase in turn. In this dissertation, we aim to develop more …
