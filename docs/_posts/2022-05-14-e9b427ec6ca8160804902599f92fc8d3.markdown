Many large knowledge graphs are now available and ready to provide semantically structured information that is regarded as an important resource for question answering and decision support tasks. However, they are built on rigid symbolic frameworks which makes them hard to be used in other intelligent systems. Knowledge graph embedding approaches are gaining increasing attention, which embeds symbolic entities and relations into continuous vector spaces.
