Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular model when it comes to analyzing large amounts of text. It is a generative probabilistic model that enables users to uncover hidden (latent) topics and themes from a collection of documents. LDA models each document as being generated by a process of repeatedly sampling words and topics from statistical distributions. By applying clever algorithms, LDA is able to recover the most likely distributions that were used in this generative process (Blei, 2003).
