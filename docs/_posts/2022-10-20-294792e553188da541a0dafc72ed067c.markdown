Data augmentation-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods have made great progress in computer vision and natural language processing areas. One of the most important factors is that the semantic structure invariance of these data allows the augmentation procedure (eg, rotating images or masking words) to thoroughly utilize the enormous amount of unlabeled data. However, the tabular data does not possess an obvious invariant structure, and therefore similar data augmentation  Cites: COVID-19 information retrieval with deep-learning based semantic
