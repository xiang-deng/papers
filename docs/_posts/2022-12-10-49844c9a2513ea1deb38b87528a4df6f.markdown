The rapid development and application of natural language generation (NLG) techniques has revolutionized the field of automatic text production. However, these techniques are still limited in their ability to produce human-like text that is truly reasonable and informative. In this paper, we explore the importance of NLG being guided by knowledge, in order to convey human-like reasoning through language generation. We propose ten goals for intelligent NLG systems to pursue, and briefly …
