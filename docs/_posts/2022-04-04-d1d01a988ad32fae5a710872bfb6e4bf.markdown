Abstract Knowledge representation and reasoning (KR&R) has been successfully implemented in many fields to enable computers to solve complex problems with AI methods. However, its application to biomedicine has been lagging in part due to the daunting complexity of molecular and cellular pathways that govern human physiology and pathology. In this article, we describe concrete uses of Scalable PrecisiOn Medicine Knowledge Engine (SPOKE), an open knowledge network that Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
