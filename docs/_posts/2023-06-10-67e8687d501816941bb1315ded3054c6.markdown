Topic models have been prevalent for decades with various applications. However, existing topic models commonly suffer from the notorious topic collapsing: discovered topics semantically collapse towards each other, leading to highly repetitive topics, insufficient topic discovery, and damaged model interpretability. In this paper, we propose a new neural topic model, Embedding Clustering Regularization Topic Model (ECRTM). Besides the existing reconstruction error, we  Cites: Applications of topic models
