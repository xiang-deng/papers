Event argument extraction has long been studied as a sequential prediction problem with extractive-based methods, tackling each argument in isolation. Although recent work proposes generation-based methods to capture cross-argument dependency, they require generating and post-processing a complicated target sequence (template). Motivated by these observations and recent pretrained language models capabilities of learning from demonstrations. We propose a retrieval-augmented Cites: Retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks
