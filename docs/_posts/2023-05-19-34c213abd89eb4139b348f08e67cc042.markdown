Task-oriented dialogue systems depend on dialogue state tracking to keep track of the intentions of users in the course of conversations. Recent studies in dialogue state tracking have achieved good performance, although the great majority of them do not consider slot correlation and just predict the value of every slot separately. In this work, we propose an efficient slot correlation learning network that can capture the correlations among slots as precisely as possible. Specifically, a BERT-base  Cites: Transferable multi-domain state generator for task-oriented
