With the rapid development of crowdsourcing learning, amount of labels can be obtained from crowd workers fast and cheaply. However, crowdsourcing learning also faces challenges due to the varied qualities of amateurish crowd workers. To improve the quality of crowd labels, many researchers focus on inferring the ground truth from noisy labels, and take different factors, eg the reliability of workers and the difficulty of instances, into consideration to infer the aggregated labels.
