Users  social connections have recently shown significant benefits to session-based recommendations, and graph neural networks have demonstrated great success in learning the pattern of information flow among users. However, the current paradigm presumes a given social network, which is not necessarily consistent with the fast- evolving shared interests and is expensive to collect. We propose a novel idea to learn the graph structure among users and make recommendations collectively in a Cites: Recommender systems with social regularization
