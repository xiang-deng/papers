Task-oriented conversational systems often use dialogue state tracking to represent the user s intentions, which involves filling in values of pre-defined slots. Many approaches have been proposed, often using task-specific architectures with special- purpose classifiers. Recently, good results have been obtained using more general architectures based on pretrained language models. Here, we introduce a new variation of the language modeling approach that uses schema-driven prompting to Cites: SCoRe: Pre-Training for Context Representation in Conversational
