Recent years are witnessing the rapid development of social recommendation to improve the performance of recommender system, especially for cold start problem. Many of the existing social recommendation techniques utilize matrix factorization-based model, which would not essentially capture the complex nonlinear relationships for the user-item interactions and user-user interactions. Inspired by the successful application of deep neural networks on computer vision, natural language
