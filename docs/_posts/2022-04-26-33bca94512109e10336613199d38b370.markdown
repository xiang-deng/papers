Abstract Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in graph-related tasks. Most of them pass messages between direct neighbors and the deeper GNNs can theoretically capture the more global neighborhood information. However, they often suffer from over-smoothing problems when the GNNs  depth deepens. To eliminate this limitation, we propose a path-aware multi- hop graph framework with hop-level attention (HAPG), which has a larger receptive Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
