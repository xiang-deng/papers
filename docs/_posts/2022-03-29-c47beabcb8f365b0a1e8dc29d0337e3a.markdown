Background Information in pathology reports is critical for cancer care. Natural language processing (NLP) systems used to extract information from pathology reports are often narrow in scope or require extensive tuning. Consequently, there is growing interest in automated deep learning approaches. A powerful new NLP algorithm, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), was published in late 2018. BERT set new performance standards on tasks as diverse as Cites: What does BERT look at? An analysis of BERT s attention
