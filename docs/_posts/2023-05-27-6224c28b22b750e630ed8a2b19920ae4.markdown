Recently proposed weakly-supervised text classification settings train a classifier using the label name of each target class as the only supervision. Such weakly-supervised settings have been gaining increasing attention since they can largely reduce human annotation efforts compared to fully-supervised and semi-supervised settings. Most existing methods follow the strategy that first uses the label names as static features to generate pseudo labels, which are then used for classifier training Cites: Document modeling with gated recurrent neural network for
