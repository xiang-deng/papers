ABSTRACT A knowledge graph (KG) has nodes and edges representing entities and relations. KGs are central to search and question answering (QA), yet research on deep/neural representation of KGs, as well as deep QA, have moved largely to AI, ML and NLP communities. The goal of this tutorial is to give IR researchers a thorough update on the best practices of neural KG representation and inference from AI, ML and NLP communities, and then explore how KG representation  Cites: The role of semantic information in learning question classifiers
