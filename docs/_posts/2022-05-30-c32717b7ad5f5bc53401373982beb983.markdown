The current success of modern visual reasoning systems is arguably attributed to cross-modality attention mechanisms. However, in deliberative reasoning such as in VQA, attention is unconstrained at each step, and thus may serve as a statistical pooling mechanism rather than a semantic operation intended to select information relevant to inference. This is because at training time, attention is only guided by a very sparse signal (ie the answer label) at the end of the inference chain.
