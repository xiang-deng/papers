Training a model with access to human explanations can improve data efficiency and model performance on in-and out-of-domain data. Adding to these empirical findings, similarity with the process of human learning makes learning from explanations a promising way to establish a fruitful human-machine interaction. Several methods have been proposed for improving natural language processing (NLP) models with human explanations, that rely on different explanation types and mechanism for Cites: Explain yourself! leveraging language models for commonsense
