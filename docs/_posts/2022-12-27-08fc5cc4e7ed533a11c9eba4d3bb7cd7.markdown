Argument Mining is an emerging research area in natural language processing; it is concerned with extracting arguments and their structure from text documents. Deep neural networks and contextualized word embeddings have been recently obtaining state-of-the-art results on various classification and relation extraction tasks including argument mining, but they tend to learn spurious correlations and to memorize high-frequency patterns possibly undermining systems predictions. In this paper we  Cites: End-to-end Relation Extraction using LSTMs on Sequences and
