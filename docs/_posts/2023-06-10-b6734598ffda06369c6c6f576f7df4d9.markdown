Few-shot named entity recognition (NER) exploits limited annotated instances to identify named mentions. Effectively transferring the internal or external resources thus becomes the key to few-shot NER. While the existing prompt tuning methods have shown remarkable few-shot performances, they still fail to make full use of knowledge. In this work, we investigate the integration of rich knowledge to prompt tuning for stronger few-shot NER. We propose incorporating the deep prompt tuning  Cites: RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach
