Intent detector is a central component of any task-oriented conversational system. The goal of the intent detector is to identify the user s goal by classifying natural language utterances. In recent years, research has focused on supervised intent detection models. Supervised learning approaches cannot accommodate unseen intents, which may emerge after the system has been deployed—the more practically relevant setting, known as zero-shot intent detection. The existing zero-shot learning …
