Bridges play an important role in modern transportation systems and road networks, and hence it is essential to use various models based on visual inspection to detect and prevent the damages on the surface of bridge structure. However, due to the limitation of traditional models or lack of modelling data, bridge damages are often difficult to be accurately detected. This paper proposed a novel deep learning model called Bridge Detection Transformers (BR-DETR) based on Detection Transformers …
