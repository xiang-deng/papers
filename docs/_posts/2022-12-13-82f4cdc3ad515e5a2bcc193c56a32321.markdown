This review article examines recent advances in the use of machine learning for process industries. The article presents common process industry tasks that researchers are solving with machine learning techniques. It then identifies a lack of consensus among past studies when selecting an appropriate model given a prescribed application. Furthermore, the article identifies that relatively few past studies have considered model interpretability–a “black-box” challenge holding back …
