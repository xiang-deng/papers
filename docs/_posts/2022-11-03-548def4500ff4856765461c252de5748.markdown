The effectiveness of prompt learning has been demonstrated in different pre-trained language models. By formulating suitable template and choosing representative label mapping, prompt learning can be used as an efficient knowledge probe. However, finding suitable prompt in existing methods requires multiple experimental attempts or appropriate vector initialization on formulating suitable template and choosing representative label mapping, which it is more common in few-shot Cites: Making Pre-trained Language Models Better Few-shot Learners
