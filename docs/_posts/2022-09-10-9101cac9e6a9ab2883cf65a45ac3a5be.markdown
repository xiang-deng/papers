Extractive document summarization is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP). Recently, several Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are proposed for this task. However, most existing GNN-based models can neither effectively encode semantic nodes of multiple granularity level apart from sentences nor substantially capture different cross-sentence meta-paths. To address these issues, we propose MHgatSum, a novel Multi-granularity Heterogeneous Graph ATtention  Cites: Graph convolution over pruned dependency trees improves
