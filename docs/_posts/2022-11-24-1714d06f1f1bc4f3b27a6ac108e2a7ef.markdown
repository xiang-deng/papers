We have studied the automatic generation of product descriptions. It is important to evaluate the generated content from the viewpoint of how much the content can motivate people to buy. In this research, we propose the grammar axis, the content axis, and the attribute axis as evaluation axes for product descriptions. The attribute axis has three sub-axes which are the trust sub-axis, the attractive sub-axis, and the polite sub-axis.
