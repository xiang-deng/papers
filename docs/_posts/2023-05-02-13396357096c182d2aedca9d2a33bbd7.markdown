In excimer laser operation, the maintenance choices by the field service engineer are critical to maximize laser performance while minimizing laser downtime, part replacement expenses, and overall touches to the instrument. To optimize maintenance choices, the engineer must estimate future internal performance of the laser, the impact of each consumable part and their interactions, the impact of operational settings and their interactions, and the optimal timing for each  Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
