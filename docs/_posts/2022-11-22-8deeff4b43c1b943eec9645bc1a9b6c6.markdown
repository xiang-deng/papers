Automatic program repair (APR) techniques focus on automatically repairing bugs in programs and providing correct patches for developers, which have been investigated for decades. However, most studies have limitations in repairing complex bugs. To overcome these limitations, we developed an approach that augments datasets by utilizing token tagging and applying machine learning techniques for APR. First, to alleviate the data insufficiency problem, we augmented  Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
