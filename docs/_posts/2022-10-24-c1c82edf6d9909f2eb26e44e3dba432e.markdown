Social science approaches to missing values predict avoided, unrequested, or lost information from dense data sets, typically surveys. The authors propose a matrix factorization approach to missing data imputation that (1) identifies underlying factors to model similarities across respondents and responses and (2) regularizes across factors to reduce their overinfluence for optimal data reconstruction. This approach may enable social scientists to draw new conclusions from sparse data sets with a …
