With growing opportunities and incentives to disrupt critical space infrastructure systems, cybersecurity of data pipelines associated with satellite images is becoming an increasingly important task. Combined with this threat is a growing body of literature focused on data poisoning and backdoor attacks on deep learning models tailored toward image recognition. To date, there is no work exploring backdoor attacks on deep learning models trained on satellite data. In this study, we evaluate Cites: Weight Poisoning Attacks on Pre-trained Models
