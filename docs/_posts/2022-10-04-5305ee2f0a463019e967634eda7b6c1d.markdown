Abstract Knowledge graphs (KGs) store facts in the form of triples that contain two entities and the relation between them. This relation is usually a standardized part of the KG schema and could thus be denoted by any arbitrary unique identifier, eg, an integer. Typically, however, each relation is assigned a short phrase, such as born in, to describe its meaning intuitively. In this way, the triple resembles a natural language statement although it often lacks the fluency of a real sentence. It is …
