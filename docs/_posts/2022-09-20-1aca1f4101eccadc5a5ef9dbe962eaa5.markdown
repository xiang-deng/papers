When exploring a new dataset, Data Scientists often apply analysis queries, look for insights in the resulting dataframe, and repeat to apply further queries. We propose in this paper a novel solution that assists data scientists in this laborious process. In a nutshell, our solution pinpoints the most interesting (sets of) rows in each obtained dataframe. Uniquely, our definition of interest is based on the contribution of each row to the interestingness of different columns of the entire dataframe, which, in turn  Cites: DBExplorer: Exploratory Search in Databases.
