Vertical federated learning is a type of federated learning which aims to achieve feature fusion of different participants, and the data possessed at distinct participants usually contain different features. In vertical federated learning, distributed deep learning schemes represented by Split learning have received extensive attention. However, Split learning has problems such as label leakage due to frequent gradient interactions. Aiming to solving the above problems, and considering that there are Cites: BERT: pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
