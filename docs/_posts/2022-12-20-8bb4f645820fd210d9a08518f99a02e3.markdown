Zero-shot object classification aims to recognize the object of unseen classes whose supervised data are unavailable in the training stage. Recent zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods usually propose to generate new supervised data for unseen classes by designing various deep generative networks. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep generative ZSL approach that trains the data generation module and object classification module jointly, rather than separately as in the majority of  Cites: Auto-scaling Vision Transformers without Training
