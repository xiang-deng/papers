Most evaluations of attribution methods focus on the English language. In this work, we present a multilingual approach for evaluating attribution methods for the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task in terms of plausibility and faithfulness properties. First, we introduce a novel cross-lingual strategy to measure faithfulness based on word alignments, which eliminates the potential downsides of erasure-based evaluations. We then perform a comprehensive evaluation of attribution methods Cites: Word Alignment by Fine-tuning Embeddings on Parallel Corpora
