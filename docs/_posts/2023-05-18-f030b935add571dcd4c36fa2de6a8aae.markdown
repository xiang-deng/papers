Generating proper embedding of sentences through an unsupervised way is beneficial to semantic matching and retrieval problems in real-world scenarios. This paper presents Representation ALchemy (RepAL), an extremely simple post-processing method that enhances sentence representations. The basic idea in RepAL is to de-emphasize redundant information of sentence embedding generated by pre-trained models. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that RepAL is Cites: Whiteningbert: An easy unsupervised sentence embedding
