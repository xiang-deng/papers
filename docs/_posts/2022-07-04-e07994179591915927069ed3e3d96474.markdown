We study graph-based approaches to span-based semantic role labeling. This task is difficult due to the need to enumerate all possible predicate-argument pairs and the high degree of imbalance between positive and negative samples. Based on these difficulties, high-order inference that considers interactions between multiple arguments and predicates is often deemed beneficial but has rarely been used in span-based semantic role labeling. Because even for second-order inference, there  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
