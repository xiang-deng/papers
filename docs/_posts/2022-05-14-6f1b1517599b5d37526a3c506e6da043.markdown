Understanding how ML models work is a prerequisite for responsibly designing, deploying, and using ML-based systems. With interpretability approaches, ML can now offer explanations for its outputs to aid human understanding. Though these approaches rely on guidelines for how humans explain things to each other, they ultimately solve for improving the artifact--an explanation. In this paper, we propose an alternate framework for interpretability grounded in Weick s sensemaking theory Cites: Does the whole exceed its parts? the effect of ai explanations on
