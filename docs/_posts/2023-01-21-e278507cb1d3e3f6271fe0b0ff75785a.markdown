Deep supervised learning algorithms generally require large numbers of labeled examples to attain satisfactory performance. To avoid the expensive cost incurred by collecting and labeling too many examples, as a subset of unsupervised learning, self-supervised learning (SSL) was proposed to learn good features from many unlabeled examples without any human-annotated labels. SSL has recently become a hot research topic, and many related algorithms have been proposed. However Cites: SpanBERT: Improving Pre-training by Representing and Predicting
