How to obtain good retrieval performance in the case of few-shot labeled samples is the current research focus of Person Re-Identification. To facilitate formal analysis, we formally put forward the concept of Pseudo-Supervised Learning (PSL) to represent a series of research works based on label generation under few-shot condition. Through extensive investigations, we find that the main problem that needs to be solved of PSL is how we can improve the quality of pseudo-label. To
