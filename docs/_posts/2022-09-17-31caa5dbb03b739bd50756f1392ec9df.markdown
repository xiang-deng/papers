Recently there is an increasing scholarly interest in time-varying knowledge graphs, or temporal knowledge graphs (TKG). Previous research suggests diverse approaches to TKG reasoning that uses historical information. However, less attention has been given to the hierarchies within such information at different timestamps. Given that TKG is a sequence of knowledge graphs based on time, the chronology in the sequence derives hierarchies between the graphs.
