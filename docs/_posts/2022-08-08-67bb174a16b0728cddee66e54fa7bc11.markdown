Recent breakthroughs based on big/foundation models reveal a vague avenue for artificial intelligence, that is, bid data, big/foundation models, big learning, $\cdots $. Following that avenue, here we elaborate on the newly introduced big learning. Specifically, big learning comprehensively exploits the available information inherent in large-scale complete/incomplete data, by simultaneously learning to model many-to-all joint/conditional/marginal data distributions (thus named big learning) with one Cites: On the opportunities and risks of foundation models
