Acronym Identification means to recognizing acronyms and their definitions in a given paragraph by an algorithm. Existing studies have shown that the pre-training model has significant performance advantages in acronyms recognition. However, the vanilla Bert measures randomly masking tokens in the pre-training, which may also abbreviate the token of acronyms in sentence. The continuous masking method will be more helpful to the recognition and interpretation of acronyms. In this paper Cites: Deep contextualized word representations. arXiv 2018
