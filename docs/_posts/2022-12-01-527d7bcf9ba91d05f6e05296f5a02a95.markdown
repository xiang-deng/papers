The power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) depends heavily on the training data quantity, quality and diversity. However, in many real scenarios, it is costly and time-consuming to collect and annotate large-scale data. This has severely hindered the application of DNNs. To address this challenge, we explore a new task of dataset expansion, which seeks to automatically create new labeled samples to expand a small dataset. To this end, we present a Guided Imagination Framework (GIF) that Cites: Robust fine-tuning of zero-shot models
