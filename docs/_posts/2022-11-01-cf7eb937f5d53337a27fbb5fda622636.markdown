Natural language understanding (NLU) tasks are typically defined by creating an annotated dataset in which each utterance is encountered once. Such data does not resemble real-world natural language interactions in which certain utterances are encountered frequently, others rarely. For deployed NLU systems, this is a vital problem, since the underlying machine learning (ML) models are often fine-tuned on typical NLU data, in which utterance frequency is never factored in, and then applied Cites: Meta-learning for domain generalization in semantic parsing
