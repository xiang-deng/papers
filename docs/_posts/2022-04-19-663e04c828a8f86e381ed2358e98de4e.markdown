This research aims at comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms used for NaI (TI) gamma-ray detector based radioisotope identification. Six machine learning algorithms were implemented, including support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The hyper-parameters of each model were elaborately optimized. The effects of data size, statistical Cites: WikiQA: A challenge dataset for open-domain question answering
