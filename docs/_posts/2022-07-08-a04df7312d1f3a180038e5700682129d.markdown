As a leading graph clustering technique, spectral clustering is one of the most widely used clustering methods to capture complex clusters in data. Some additional prior information can help it to further reduce the difference between its clustering results and users expectations. However, it is hard to get the prior information under unsupervised scene to guide the clustering process. To solve this problem, we propose a self-constrained spectral clustering algorithm. In this algorithm, we extend  Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
