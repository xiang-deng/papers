We present a novel framework for probing and improving relational, compositional and contextual understanding of large visual-language models (V+ L). While large V+ L models have achieved success in various downstream tasks, it is not clear if they have a conceptual grasp of the content. We propose a novel benchmarking dataset for probing three aspects of content understanding. Our probes are grounded in cognitive science and help determine if a V+ L model can, for example, determine …
