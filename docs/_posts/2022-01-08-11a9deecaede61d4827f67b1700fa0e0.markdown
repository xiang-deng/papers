The introduction of embedding techniques has pushed forward significantly the Natural Language Processing field. Many of the proposed solutions have been presented for word-level encoding; anyhow, in the last years, new mechanisms to treat information at a higher level of aggregation, like at sentence-and documentlevel, have emerged. With this work, we address specifically the sentence embeddings problem, presenting the Static Fuzzy Bag-of-Word model. Our model is Cites: Deep learning and continuous representations for natural
