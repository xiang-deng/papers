Existing label assignment strategies have achieved promising performance for providing learning targets, typically rely on statistical information and location characteristics. However, classical label assignment strategies usually lack a comprehensive quality evaluation criterion. As a result, the quality of positive samples is not reliable, which weakens the performance of detectors. We propose a dynamic label assignment strategy to provide higher quality positive samples for  Cites: Learning from noisy anchors for one-stage object detection
