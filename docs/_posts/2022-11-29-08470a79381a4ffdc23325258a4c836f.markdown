Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to use interactions between aspect terms and their contexts to predict sentiment polarity for given aspects in sentences. Current mainstream approaches use deep neural networks (DNNs) combined with additional linguistic information to improve performance. DNN-based methods, however, lack explanation and transparency to support predictions, and no existing model completely solves the trade-off between explainability and performance.
