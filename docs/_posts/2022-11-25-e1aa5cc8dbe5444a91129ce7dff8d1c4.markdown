Unsupervised domain adaptation is a machine learning-oriented application that aims to transfer knowledge learned from a seen (source) domain with labeled data to an unseen (target) domain with only unlabeled data. Recently developed techniques apply adversarial learning to learn domain-transferable features. However, current adversarial domain adaptation models suffer from the training instability of adversarial networks. Furthermore, it is unclear what the source domain pays in …
