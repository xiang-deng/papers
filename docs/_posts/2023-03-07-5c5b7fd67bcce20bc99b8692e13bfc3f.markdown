Abstract The Successor Feature framework for Reinforcement Learning algorithms improves task transfer by decomposing the learned stateaction value function. The decomposition involves two components, one that captures future-expected state features and the other that models the task-related reward structure. However, successful transfer between tasks depends heavily on how the reward function changes, possibly leading to failure of the original Successor Feature formulation Cites: Chip placement with deep reinforcement learning
