Due to the characteristics of the Chinese writing system, character-based Chinese named entity recognition models ignore the word information in sentences, which harms their performance. Recently, many works try to alleviate the problem by integrating lexicon information into character-based models. These models, however, either simply concatenate word embeddings, or have complex structures which lead to low efficiency. Furthermore, word information is viewed as the only Cites: Syn-QG: Syntactic and shallow semantic rules for question
