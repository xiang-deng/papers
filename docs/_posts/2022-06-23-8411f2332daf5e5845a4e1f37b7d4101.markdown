ABSTRACT Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms show a strong performance for many use cases, making them desirable for realworld scenarios where the algorithms provide high-impact decisions. However, one major drawback of AI algorithms is their susceptibility to bias and resulting unfairness. This has a huge influence for their application, as they have a higher failure rate for certain subgroups. In this paper, we focus on the field of affective computing and particularly
