The goal of unsupervised cross-modal hashing (UCMH) is to map different modalities into a semantic-preserving hamming space without requiring label supervision. Existing deep approaches mainly took classic CNNs and multilayer perceptrons to encode images and texts, which are inadequate for semantic extraction and hard to generate high-quality hash codes. Motivated by recent advances in transformers, we take the first investigation of transformer-based UCMH Cites: Jingfei Du, Mandar Joshi, Danqi Chen, Omer Levy, Mike Lewis
