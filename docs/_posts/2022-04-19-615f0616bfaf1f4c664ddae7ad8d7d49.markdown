Existing automated scoring models implement layers of traditional recurrent neural networks to achieve reasonable performance. However, the models provide limited performance due to the limited capacity to encode long-term dependencies. The paper proposed a novel architecture incorporating pioneering language models of the natural language processing community. We leverage pre-trained language models and integrate it with adapter modules, which use a bottle-neck architecture to Cites: Adapterhub: A framework for adapting transformers
