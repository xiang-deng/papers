Research in model robustness has a long history. Improving model robustness generally refers to the goal of ensuring machine learning models are resistant to a variety of imperfect training and testing conditions. With the unprecedented progress in deep learning architectures, large-scale training, and learning algorithms, pretrained models have become pivotal in AI. However, when considering real-world scenarios, these models are still fragile and brittle, which impedes the safe …
