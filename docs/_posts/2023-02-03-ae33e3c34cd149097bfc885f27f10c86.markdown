Event extraction is a crucial task that aims to extract event information in texts. Existing methods usually use pre-trained language models to extract events and have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, these models do not consider the complexity of the event structure and lack the use of event knowledge. To address these problems, we propose a new framework that integrates event annotation into the pre-trained model explicitly, termd as EABERT. Specifically, event …
