Computational poetics encompasses the wide range of challenges implicit in analyzing and generating poetry--in all of its many forms--through computational techniques and frameworks. In this paper we build on a nascent body of work that has proposed the use of the limerick as a model organism for computational poetics, and in particular the use of Benchmarked Poetic Minimal Pairs (BPoMP) as an investigative framework, especially for the evaluation of the poetic abilities of deep Cites: All that s human is not gold: Evaluating human evaluation of
