This project investigates the capabilities of Machine Translation models for generating translations at varying levels of readability, focusing on texts related to COVID-19.

So far, we have collected a new dataset with manual simplifications for English and Spanish sentences in the TICO-19 dataset, as  Cites: TICO-19: the Translation Initiative for COvid-19
