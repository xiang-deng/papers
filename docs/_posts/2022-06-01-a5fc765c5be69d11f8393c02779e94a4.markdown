Tooth point cloud segmentation plays an important role in the digital dentistry, and has received much attention in the past decade. Recently, methods based on the graph neural network have made significant progress. However, the development has been hindered by two challenges:(1) the heterogeneous geometry data are analyzed separately or combined linearly which leads to a semantic gap in different streams;(2) there is mis-alignment between the loss function and evaluation metrics … Cites: ‪Regularized evolution for image classifier architecture search‬
