Abstract Information systems need to process a large amount of event monitoring data. The process of finding the relationships between events is called correlation, which creates a context between independent events and previously collected information in real time and normalizes it for subsequent processing. In cybersecurity, events can determine the steps of attackers and can be analyzed as part of a specific attack strategy. In this survey, we present the systematization of  Cites: Zero-Shot Transfer Learning for Event Extraction
