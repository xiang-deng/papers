Whether Transformers can learn to apply symbolic rules and generalise to out-of-distribution examples is an open research question. In this paper, we devise a data generation method for producing intricate mathematical derivations, and systematically perturb them with respect to syntax, structure, and semantics. Our task-agnostic approach generates equations, annotations, and inter-equation dependencies, employing symbolic algebra for scalable data production and  Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
