GPT-3 has attracted much attention from both academia and industry. However, it is still unclear what GPT-3 has understood or learned especially in linguistic knowledge.

In this study, we conduct probing tasks focusing on semantic information. Specifically, we investigate GPT-3 s linguistic knowledge on semantic tasks to identify tense, the number of  Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
