Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown the strong performance of learning neural models automatically in recent years. But most NAS systems are unreliable due to the architecture gap brought by discrete representations of atomic architectures. In this paper, we improve the performance and robustness of NAS var narrowing the gap between architecture representations. More specifically, we apply a general contraction mapping to model neural networks with distributed Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications. AI
