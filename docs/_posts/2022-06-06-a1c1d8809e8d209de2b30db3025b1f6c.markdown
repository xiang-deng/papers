For the sake of better achieving the productivity of leather damage detection in industrial production, this paper proposes a Robust Breakage Detection Network (RBD-Net) model for leather breakage detection. The model is an optimized model of You Only Look Once (YOLO) v5 to identify and detect the degrees of damage in leather and the type of damage in leather without any damage from the image. Firstly, the backbone network is replaced by Cross Stage Partial Densely Connected …
