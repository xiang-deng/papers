GeeseDB is a Python toolkit for solving information retrieval research problems that leverage graphs as data structures. It aims to simplify information retrieval research by allowing researchers to easily formulate graph queries through a graph query language. GeeseDB is built on top of DuckDB, an embedded column-store relational database designed for analytical workloads. GeeseDB is available as an easy to install Python package. In only a few lines of code users can create a first stage Cites: Sparse, Dense, and Attentional Representations for Text Retrieval
