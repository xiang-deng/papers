ABSTRACT Many Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are black boxes, which hinders their deployment. Explainable AI (XAI) approaches which automatically generate counterfactual explanations aim to assist users in scrutinising AI decisions. One property of explanations crucial for their acceptance by users is their coherence. Users perceive counterfactual explanations as coherent if they present a realistic/typical counterfactual scenario that is suitable to explain the factual situation Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
