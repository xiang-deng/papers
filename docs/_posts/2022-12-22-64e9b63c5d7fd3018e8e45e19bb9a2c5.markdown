We propose a simple and practical method for named entity linking (NEL), based on entity representation by multiple embeddings. To explore this method, and to review its dependency on parameters, we measure its performance on Namesakes, a highly challenging dataset of ambiguously named entities. Our observations suggest that the minimal number of mentions required to create a knowledge base (KB) entity is very important for NEL performance. The number of embeddings is less important …
