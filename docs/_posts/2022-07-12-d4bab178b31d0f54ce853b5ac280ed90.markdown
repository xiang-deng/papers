Question answering over knowledge graphs targets to leverage facts in knowledge graphs to answer natural language questions. The presence of large number of facts, particularly in huge and well-known knowledge graphs such as DBpedia, makes it difficult to access the knowledge graph for each given question. This paper describes a generic solution based on Personal Page Rank for extracting a small subset from the knowledge graph as a knowledge subgraph which is likely to capture the answer  Cites: The value of semantic parse labeling for knowledge base question
