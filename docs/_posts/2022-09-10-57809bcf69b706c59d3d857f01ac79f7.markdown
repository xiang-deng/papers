The resilience of a query q (RES (q)) measures the minimum number of source tuples responsible for a specific query answer. If q is an IQ query, whose at most one attribute from a table has inequality relationships with attributions from other tables, the state-of-the-art work had shown that RES (q) is in PTIME. However, the state-of-the-art work is inefficient for computing the resilience of IQ queries. Moreover, the complexity of resilience for self-join free (sj-free) CQs with other kinds of inequalities Cites: Constraint-based explanation and repair of filter-based
