This study proposes a method to improve text matching through integration of lexical knowledge from external resources to model the senses of potentially ambiguous words. Specifically, a sense-aware mechanism is designed wherein a word sense disambiguation (WSD) model is introduced into text matching and both tasks (WSD and matching) are simultaneously optimized via multi-task learning. The proposed WSD is a lightweight model that distills a pre-trained BERT-based model by Cites: WikiQA: A challenge dataset for open-domain question answering
