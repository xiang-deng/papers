Investigating climatology and predicting rainfall amounts are crucial for planning and mitigating the risks caused by variable rainfall. This study utilized two multivariate polynomial regressions (MPR) and twelve machine learning algorithms, namely three artificial neural networks (ANN), four adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and five support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, to estimate monthly and annual rainfalls in a tropical location. The ground measured rainfall data were …
