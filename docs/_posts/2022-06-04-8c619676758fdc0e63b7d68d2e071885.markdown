Data has now become a shortcoming of deep learning. Researchers in their own fields share the thinking that  deep neural networks might not always perform better when they eat more data,  which still lacks experimental validation and a convincing guiding theory. Here to fill this lack, we design experiments from Identically Independent Distribution (IID) and Out of Distribution (OOD), which give powerful answers. For the purpose of guidance, based on the discussion of results, two … Cites: ‪Deep learning-enabled medical computer vision‬
