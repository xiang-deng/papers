In many spatial trajectory-based applications, it is necessary to map raw trajectory data points onto road networks in digital maps, which is commonly referred to as a map-matching process. While most previous map-matching methods have focused on using rule-based algorithms to deal with the map-matching problems, in this paper, we consider the map-matching task from the data-driven perspective, proposing a deep learning-based map-matching model. We build a Transformer Cites: Ctrl: A conditional transformer language model for controllable
