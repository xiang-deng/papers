 ChatGPT is a Large Language Model (LLM) that is finetuned from a Generative Pre-Trained Transformer-3.5 (GPT-3.5) series LLM, produced by OpenAI. An LLM is a Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained to generate text similar to human language. The fine-tuning of the GPT-3.5 is performed using supervised and reinforcement learning with human feedback [OPE2023].  Cites: NusaCrowd: Open Source Initiative for Indonesian NLP Resources
