Thirty-eight percent of protein structures in the Protein Data Bank contain at least one metal ion. However, not all these metal sites are biologically relevant. Cations present as impurities during sample preparation or in the crystallization buffer can cause the formation of protein–metal complexes that do not exist in vivo. We implemented a deep learning approach to build a classifier able to distinguish between physiological and adventitious zinc-binding sites in the 3D structures of …
