The increasing worldwide adoption of e-learning tools and widespread increase of online education has brought multiple challenges, including the ability of generating assessments at the scale and speed demanded by this environment. In this sense, recent advances in language models and architectures like the Transformer, provide opportunities to explore how to assist educators in these tasks. This study focuses on using neural language models for the generation of questionnaires composed of  Cites: Question answering and question generation as dual tasks
