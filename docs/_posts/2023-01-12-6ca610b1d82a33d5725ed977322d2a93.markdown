Automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks have become important tools in the data scientist s arsenal, as they dramatically reduce the manual work devoted to the construction of ML pipelines. Such frameworks intelligently search among millions of possible ML pipelines-typically containing feature engineering, model selection, and hyper parameters tuning steps-and finally output an optimal pipeline in terms of predictive accuracy. However, when the dataset is large, each individual Cites: Visualization-aware sampling for very large databases
