Distantly supervised relation extraction (DSRE) aims to identify semantic relations from massive plain texts. A broad range of the prior research has leveraged a series of selective attention mechanisms over sentences in a bag to extract relation features without considering dependencies among the relation features. As a result, potential discriminative information existed in the dependencies is ignored, causing a decline in the performance of extracting entity relations. In this article, we focus on going Cites: Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text
