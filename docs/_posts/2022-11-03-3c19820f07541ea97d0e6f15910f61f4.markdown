Many methods have been proposed for embedding ordinary knowledge graphs (KG), which greatly promote various applications. However, current knowledge graph embedding algorithms cannot encode weighted knowledge graphs (WKG), which are a generalized form of the ordinary KG. This paper gives a promising approach that enables to extend existing models to encode weighted knowledge graphs. Taking TransH as an example, we propose TransHExt. TransHExt shows competitive …
