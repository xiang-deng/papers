Neural networks have been widely adopted to address different real-world problems. Despite the remarkable achievements in machine learning tasks, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples that are imperceptible to humans but can mislead the state-of-the-art models. More specifically, such adversarial examples can be generalized to a variety of common data structures, including images, texts and networked data. Faced with the significant threat that adversarial attacks pose to  Cites: Semantically Equivalent Adversarial Rules for Debugging NLP
