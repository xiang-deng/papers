Data-driven intelligent computational design (DICD) is a research hotspot emerged under the context of fast-developing artificial intelligence. It emphasizes on utilizing deep learning algorithms to extract and represent the design features hidden in historical or fabricated design process data, and then learn the combination and mapping patterns of these design features for the purposes of design solution retrieval, generation, optimization, evaluation, etc. Due to its capability of  Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
