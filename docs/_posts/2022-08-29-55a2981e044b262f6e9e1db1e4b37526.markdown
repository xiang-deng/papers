Multiplex networks are very flexible at showing heterogeneous relationships between identical entities. Link prediction is a fundamental problem in network science. There are many studies on link prediction in complex networks, but few studies were conducted on link prediction in multiplex networks. This study proposes a method for estimating link likelihood in multiplex networks based on the Node-Accessibility-Distribution (NAD) and the co-evolving factors of layers. The NAD is Cites: Lego: Latent execution-guided reasoning for multi-hop question
