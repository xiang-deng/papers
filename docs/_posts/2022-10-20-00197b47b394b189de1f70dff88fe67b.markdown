Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to recommend items based on user behaviors in a session. For the online life service platforms, such as Meituan, both the user s location and the current time primarily cause the different patterns and intents in user behaviors. Hence, spatiotemporal context plays a significant role in the recommendation on those platforms, which motivates an important problem of spatiotemporal-aware session-based recommendation (STSBR).
