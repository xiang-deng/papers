ABSTRACT Unmanned Aerial Vehicles as a service (UAVaaS) has increased the field deployment of Robotic Aerial Vehicles (RAVs) for different services such as transportation and terrain exploration. These RAVs are controlled by firmware, which is often closed-source, developed by vendors, and flashed into the ROM. While these binary blobs enable off-the-shelf management of RAVs, end users (individuals or organizations) have no idea if the control firmware is designed and implemented
