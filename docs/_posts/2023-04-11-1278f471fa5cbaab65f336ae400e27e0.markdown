Graph representation is an important part of graph clustering. Recently, contrastive learning, which maximizes the mutual information between augmented graph views that share the same semantics, has become a popular and powerful paradigm for graph representation. However, in the process of patch contrasting, existing literature tends to learn all features into similar variables, ie, representation collapse, leading to less discriminative graph representations. To tackle this problem, we propose a Cites: Adaptive Graph Encoder for Attributed Graph Embedding
