Recently, natural language (NL)-based program synthesis has drawn increasing interest. Conventional methods that depend on some predefined domain-specific rules suffer from the lack of robustness and generality. Recent efforts on adopting deep learning to map queries to code requires a large number of labeled examples, making them not applicable on domains with scarce labeled examples. Although a third alternative, natural language understanding (NLU)-driven approach addresses Cites: Multi-modal synthesis of regular expressions
