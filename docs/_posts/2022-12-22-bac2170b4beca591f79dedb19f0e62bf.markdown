We describe PromptBoosting, a query-efficient procedure for building a text classifier from a neural language model (LM) without access to the LM s parameters, gradients, or hidden representations. This form of  black-box  classifier training has become increasingly important as the cost of training and inference in large-scale LMs grows. But existing black-box LM classifier learning approaches are themselves computationally inefficient, typically specializing LMs to the target task by searching …
