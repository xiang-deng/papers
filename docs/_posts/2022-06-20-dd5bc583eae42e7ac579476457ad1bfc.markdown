Although the production process of liquid crystal display model has been automated, the quality detection still depends on manual work. Mura defect is one of the common defects appearing in TFT-LCD modules. Since mura defect is not significantly different from the common background, it is difficult to detect. This paper presents a deep channel attention-based classification network (DCANet), which acts as a powerful feature extractor for object detectors, and proposes an antagonistic training  Cites: Efficientdet: Scalable and efficient object detection
