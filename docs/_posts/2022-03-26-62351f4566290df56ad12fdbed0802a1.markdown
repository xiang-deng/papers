This paper outlines a novel advanced framework that combines structurized knowledge and visual modelsComputational Knowledge Vision. In advanced studies of image and visual perception, a visual model s understanding and reasoning ability often determines whether it works well in complex scenarios. This paper presents the state-of-the-art mainstream of vision models for visual perception. This paper then proposes a concept and basic framework of Computational Cites: Blockwise Self-Attention for Long Document Understanding
