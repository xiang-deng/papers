Although traditional symbolic reasoning methods are highly interpretable, their application in knowledge graph link prediction is limited due to their low computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new neural symbolic reasoning method: RNNCTPs, which improves computational efficiency by re-filtering the knowledge selection of Conditional Theorem Provers (CTPs), and is less sensitive to the embedding size parameter. RNNCTPs are divided into relation selectors and Cites: Learning reasoning strategies in end-to-end differentiable proving
