Abstract Knowledge graphs (KGs) Embedding has been broadly studied in recent years. However, less light is shed on the ubiquitous hyper-relational KGs. Most existing hyper-relational KG embedding methods decompose n-ary facts into smaller tuples, undermining the structure of n-ary facts. Moreover, these models always suffer from low expressiveness and high complexity. In this work, to tackle the indecomposability issue, we represent n-ary fact as a hyperedge, keeping the Cites: Semantic parsing via staged query graph generation: Question
