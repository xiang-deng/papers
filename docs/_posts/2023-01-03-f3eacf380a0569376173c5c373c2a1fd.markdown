Adversarial learning is commonly used to extract latent data representations which are expressive to predict the target attribute but indistinguishable in the privacy attribute. However, whether they can achieve an expected privacy-utility tradeoff is of great uncertainty. In this paper, we posit it is the complex interaction between different attributes in the training set that causes disparate tradeoff results. We first formulate the measurement of utility, privacy and their tradeoff in adversarial …
