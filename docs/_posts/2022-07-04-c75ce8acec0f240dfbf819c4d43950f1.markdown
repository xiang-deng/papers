Human skeleton data has received increasing attention in action recognition due to its background robustness and high efficiency. In skeleton-based action recognition, graph convolutional network (GCN) has become the mainstream method. This paper analyzes the fundamental factor for GCN-based models--the adjacency matrix. We notice that most GCN-based methods conduct their adjacency matrix based on the human natural skeleton structure. Based on our former work and analysis, we
