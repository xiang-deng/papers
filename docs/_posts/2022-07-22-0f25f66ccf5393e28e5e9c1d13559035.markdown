This work characterizes the effect of depth on the optimization landscape of linear regression, showing that, despite their nonconvexity, deeper models have more desirable optimization landscape. We consider a robust and over-parameterized setting, where a subset of measurements are grossly corrupted with noise and the true linear model is captured via an $ N $-layer linear neural network. On the negative side, we show that this problem\textit {does not} have a benign landscape  Cites: On the opportunities and risks of foundation models
