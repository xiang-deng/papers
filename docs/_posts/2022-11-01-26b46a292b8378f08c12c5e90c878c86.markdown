Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a granular-level sentiment analysis task that aims to detect the sentiment polarities of a specified aspect in the text. This research shows excessive curiosity in modelling target and context through attention networks to attain effective feature representations for sentiment detection works. We have proposed a synthetic attention in bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (SA-BERT) with an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier to …
