The continuous growth of data pushes novel and efficient approaches for information retrieval. In this context, Regular Expression (RE) matching is widely employed and represents a relevant computational kernel that carries controland memory-related issues. Among the several solutions to relieve these burdens, accelerators seem a promising alternative to general-purpose systems. However, state-of-the-art benchmarking presents a highly fragmented scenario without consensus on the  Cites: HARE: Hardware accelerator for regular expressions
