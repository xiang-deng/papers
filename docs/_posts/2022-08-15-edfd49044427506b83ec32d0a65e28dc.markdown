Partial code usually involves non-fully-qualified type names (non-FQNs) and undeclared receiving objects. Resolving the FQNs of these non-FQN types and undeclared receiving objects (referred to as type inference) is the prerequisite to effective search and reuse of partial code. Existing dictionary-lookup based methods build a symbolic knowledge base of API names and code contexts, which involve significant compilation overhead and are sensitive to unseen API names and code Cites: Pre-train, prompt, and predict: A systematic survey of prompting
