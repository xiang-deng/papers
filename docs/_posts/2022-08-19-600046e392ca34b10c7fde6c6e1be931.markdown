In recent years, several relation extractions (RE) models have been developed to extract knowledge from natural language texts.

Albeit useful for general-purpose RE benchmarking, they do not allow the generation of customized microbenchmarks according to user-specified Cites: Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text
