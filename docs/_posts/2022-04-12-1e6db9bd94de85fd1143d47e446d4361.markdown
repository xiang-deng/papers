Recently, the adversarial attack and defense technology has made remarkable achievements and has been widely applied in the computer vision field, promoting its rapid development in other fields, primarily the natural language processing domain. However, discrete semantic texts bring additional restrictions and challenges to successfully implementing adversarial attacks and defenses. This survey systematically summarizes the current progress of adversarial techniques in the Cites: Semantically Equivalent Adversarial Rules for Debugging NLP
