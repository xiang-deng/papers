State-of-the-art deep NLP models have achieved impressive improvements on many tasks. However, they are found to be vulnerable to some perturbations. In this paper, we design a robustness enhancement method to defend against word substitution perturbation, whose basic idea is to fight perturbation with perturbation. We find that: although many welltrained deep models are not robust in the setting of the presence of adversarial samples, they satisfy weak robustness. That means they can handle Cites: Understanding and mitigating the tradeoff between robustness and
