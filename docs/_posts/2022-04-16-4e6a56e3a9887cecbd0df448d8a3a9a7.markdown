The molecular pathology of breast cancer is challenging due to the complex heterogeneity of cellular subtypes. The ability to directly identify and visualize cell subtype distribution at the single-cell level within a tissue section enables precise and rapid diagnosis and prognosis. Here, we applied mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to acquire and visualize the molecular profiles at the single-cell and subcellular levels of 14 different breast cancer cell lines. We built a molecular library of Cites: Deep learning-enabled breast cancer hormonal receptor status
