Due to the ever increasing traffic on roads, there has been a pressing need for Automatic Vehicle Detection (AVD) systems, so that the real-time traffic can be observed as well as managed in an efficient way. To address this research problem, several techniques have been put forward in the last decade by researchers across the world. In this article, a comprehensive survey has been introduced comprising various methods used for AVD and classification during the last 10 years. Besides …
