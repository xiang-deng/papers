In both PDTB-2 and PDTB-3, discourse relational senses are organized into a three-level hierarchy ranging from four broad top-level senses, to more specific senses below them. Most previous work on implicit discourse relation recognition have used the sense hierarchy simply to indicate what  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
