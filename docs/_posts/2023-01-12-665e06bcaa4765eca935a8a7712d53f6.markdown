Placement is essential in very large-scale integration (VLSI) physical design, as it directly affects the design cycle. Despite extensive prior research on placement, achieving fast and efficient placement remains challenging because of the increasing design complexity. In this paper, we comprehensively review the progress of placement optimization from the perspective of accelerating VLSI physical design. It can help researchers systematically understand the VLSI placement problem and Cites: A graph placement methodology for fast chip design
