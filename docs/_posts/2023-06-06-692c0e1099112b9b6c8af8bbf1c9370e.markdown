Neural QCFG is a grammar-based sequence-tosequence (seq2seq) model with strong inductive biases on hierarchical structures. It excels in interpretability and generalization but suffers from expensive inference. In this paper, we study two low-rank variants of Neural QCFG for faster inference with different trade-offs between efficiency and expressiveness. Furthermore, utilizing the symbolic interface provided by the grammar, we introduce two soft constraints over tree hierarchy and source Cites: Hierarchical Phrase-based Sequence-to-Sequence Learning
