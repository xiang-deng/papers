Understanding parameter estimation of softmax gating Gaussian mixture of experts has remained a long-standing open problem in the literature. It is mainly due to three fundamental theoretical challenges associated with the softmax gating:(i) the identifiability only up to the translation of the parameters;(ii) the intrinsic interaction via partial differential equation between the softmax gating and the expert functions in Gaussian distribution;(iii) the complex dependence between the numerator and …
