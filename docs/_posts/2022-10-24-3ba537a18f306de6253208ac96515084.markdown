Nonstandard language such as novel words or creative spellings of existing ones often occurs in natural text corpora, posing significant challenges for natural lan guage processing (NLP) models. While humans can successfully infer the meaning communicated in such nonstandard ways, NLP models largely discard linguistic in novation as noise, ignoring its fundamentally nonrandom nature and losing valuable context. In this thesis, we focus on computational modeling of such creative phe …
