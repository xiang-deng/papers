Explainable AI was born as a pathway to allow humans to explore and understand the inner working of complex systems. Though, establishing what is an explanation and objectively evaluating explainability, are not trivial tasks. With this paper, we present a new model-agnostic metric to measure the Degree of Explainability of (correct) information in an objective way, exploiting a specific theoretical model from Ordinary Language Philosophy called the Achinstein s Theory of Explanations Cites: Semantic parsing on freebase from question-answer pairs
