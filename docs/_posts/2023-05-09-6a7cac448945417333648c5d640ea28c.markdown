Based on the assumption that samples in the source and target domains are freely accessible during training, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) of question answering (QA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from labeled source datasets to similar tasks in the unlabeled target domains. However, such assumption can easily lead to privacy violation issues in real-world applications, especially when the source domain data involves privacy-intensive domains such as finance and healthcare.
