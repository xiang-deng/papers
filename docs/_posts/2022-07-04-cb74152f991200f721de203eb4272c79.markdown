With the latest developments and improvements in the field of deep learning and artificial intelligence, many exciting tasks of Natural Language Processing (NLP) achieved rapid growth in recent years, such as machine translation, summarization, named-entity recognition, sentiment analysis, question answering, automated speech recognition (ASR), etc. Language Modelling is the core problem for several natural language processing tasks. A trained autoregressive language model learns …
