Limited by the statistical-based machine learning framework, a spurious correlation is likely to appear in existing knowledge-aware recommendation methods. It refers to a knowledge fact that appears causal to the user behaviors (inferred by the recommender) but is not in fact. For tackling this issue, we present a novel approach to discovering and alleviating the potential spurious correlations from a counterfactual perspective. To be specific, our approach consists of two Cites: Robustness to spurious correlations via human annotations
