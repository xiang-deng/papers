Facial age estimation has attracted considerable attention owing to its great potential in applications. However, it still falls short of reliable age estimation due to the lack of sufficient training data with accurate age labels. Using conventional semi-supervised methods to exploit unlabeled data appears to be a good solution, but it does not yield sufficient performance gains while significantly increasing training time. Therefore, to tackle these problems, we present a Divergence-driven Consistency Training (DCT) …
