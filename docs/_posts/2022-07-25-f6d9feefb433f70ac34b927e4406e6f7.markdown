We tackle the problem of Selective Classification where the goal is to achieve the best performance on the desired coverages of the dataset. Recent state-of-the-art selective methods come with architectural changes either via introducing a separate selection head or an extra abstention logit. In this paper, we present surprising results for Selective Classification by confirming that the superior performance of state-of-the-art methods is owed to training a more generalizable classifier; however  Cites: Selective classification can magnify disparities across groups
