Masked Autoencoders is a simple yet powerful self-supervised learning method. However, it learns representations indirectly by reconstructing masked input patches. Several methods learn representations directly by predicting representations of masked patches; however, we think using all patches to encode training signal representations is suboptimal. We propose a new method, Masked Modeling Duo (M2D), that learns representations directly while obtaining training signals using only  Cites: Bigssl: Exploring the frontier of large-scale semi-supervised
