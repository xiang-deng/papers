Automated program repair (APR) aims to help developers improve software reliability by generating patches for buggy programs. Although many code language models (CLM) are developed and effective in many software tasks such as code completion, there has been little comprehensive, in-depth work to evaluate CLMs fixing capabilities and to fine-tune CLMs for the APR task. Firstly, this work is the first to evaluate ten CLMs on four APR benchmarks, which shows that surprisingly, the best  Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
