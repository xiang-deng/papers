The last decade produced rapid developments and powerful new technologies that are creating a huge upsurge in artificial intelligence research. However, for critical operational decisions (eg, consulting services), the need for explanations and interpretable results are becoming a necessity. The integration of knowledge graphs that provide relevant background knowledge in machine-readable form, and machine learning methods represents a new form of hybrid intelligent systems that Cites: Learning Knowledge Graphs for Question Answering through
