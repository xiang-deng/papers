Regardless of the often-claimed success of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), AI-based Digital Decision Support Systems (DDSS) still suffer from low adoption rates. Much algorithmic research is done, but examples of AI bringing tangible benefits to the healthcare industry are rare. In this paper, we argue that one of the reasons for those low adoption rates might be the missing domain understanding among the DDSS developers and/or the heterogeneity of domain  Cites: Why Your Data Wont Mix: New tools and techniques can help
