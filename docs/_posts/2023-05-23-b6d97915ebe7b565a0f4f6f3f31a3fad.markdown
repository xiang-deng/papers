With the development of large language models (LLMs), zero-shot learning has attracted much attention for various NLP tasks. Different from prior works that generate training data with billion-scale natural language generation (NLG) models, we propose a retrieval-enhanced framework to create training data from a general-domain unlabeled corpus. To realize this, we first conduct contrastive pretraining to learn an unsupervised dense retriever for extracting the most relevant documents Cites: Latent retrieval for weakly supervised open domain question
