We develop the first universal password model--a password model that, once pre-trained, can automatically adapt to any password distribution. To achieve this result, the model does not need to access any plaintext passwords from the target set. Instead, it exploits users auxiliary information, such as email addresses, as a proxy signal to predict the underlying target password distribution. The model uses deep learning to capture the correlation between the auxiliary data of a group of users (eg Cites: On the opportunities and risks of foundation models
