Abstract The application of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the detection of COVID-19 infection has yielded favorable results. However, with excessive model parameters, the CNN detection of COVID-19 is low in recall, highly complex in computation. In this paper, a novel lightweight CNN model, CodnNet is proposed for quick detection of COVID-19 infection. CodnNet builds a more effective dense connections based on DenseNet network to make features highly reusable and …
