This work proposes the use of a fine-tuned Transformer-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) model called BERTimbau to generate the word embeddings from texts published in a Brazilian newspaper, to create a robust NLP model to classify news in Portuguese, a task that is costly for humans to perform for big amounts of data. To assess this approach, besides the generation of the embeddings by the fine-tuned BERTimbau, a comparative analysis was conducted using the Word2Vec Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
