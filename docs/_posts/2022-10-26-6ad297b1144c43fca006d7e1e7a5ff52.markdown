Stackelberg Equilibria arise naturally in a range of popular learning problems, such as in security games or automated mechanism design, and have received increasing attention in the reinforcement learning literature recently. We present a general framework for implementing Stackelberg Equilibria search as a multi-agent RL problem, allowing a wide range of design choices. We discuss how previous approaches can be seen as specific instantiations of this framework. As a key insight Cites: The AI Economist: Taxation policy design via two-level deep
