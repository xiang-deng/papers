Entity alignment is to find identical entities in different knowledge graphs (KGs) that refer to the same real-world object. Embedding-based entity alignment techniques have been drawing a lot of attention recently because they can help solve the issue of symbolic heterogeneity in different KGs. However, in this paper, we show that the progress made in the past was due to biased and unchallenging evaluation. We highlight two major flaws in existing datasets that favor embedding-based entity  Cites: Exploring and Evaluating Attributes, Values, and Structures for
