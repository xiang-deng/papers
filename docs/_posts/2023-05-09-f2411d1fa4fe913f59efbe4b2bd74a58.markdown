Recent rapid advances in deep pre-trained language models and the introduction of large datasets have powered research in embeddingbased neural retrieval. While many excellent research papers have emerged, most of them come with their own implementations, which are typically optimized for some particular research goals instead of efficiency or code organization. In this paper, we introduce Tevatron, a neural retrieval toolkit that is optimized for efficiency, flexibility, and code simplicity …
