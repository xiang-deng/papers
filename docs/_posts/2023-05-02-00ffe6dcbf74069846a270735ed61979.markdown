Conditional text generation is supposed to generate a fluent and coherent target text that is faithful to the source text. Although pre-trained models have achieved promising results, they still suffer from the crucial factuality problem. To deal with this issue, we propose a factuality-aware pretraining-finetuning framework named FactGen, which fully considers factuality during two training stages. Specifically, at the pre-training stage, we utilize a natural language inference model to construct  Cites: Asking and Answering Questions to Evaluate the Factual
