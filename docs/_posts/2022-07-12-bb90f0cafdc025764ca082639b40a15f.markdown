Research on the automatic analysis of sonar images has focused on classical, ie non deep learning based, approaches for a long time. Over the past 15 years, however, the application of deep learning in this research field has constantly grown. This paper gives a broad overview of past and current research involving deep learning for feature extraction, classification, detection and segmentation of sidescan and synthetic aperture sonar imagery. Most research in this field has been directed …
