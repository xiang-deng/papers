The rapidly exploding of user data, especially applications of neural networks, involves analyzing data collected from individuals, which brings convenience to life. Meanwhile, privacy leakage in the applications as a potential threat needs to be addressed urgently. However, removing private information from models is difficult once the user s sensitive data enters machine learning models, particularly neural networks. Most of the previous amnestic methods based on retraining require full Cites: FastIF: Scalable Influence Functions for Efficient Model
