Traffic sign detection (TSD) in real-time environment holds great importance for applications such as automated-driven vehicles. Large variety of traffic signs, different appearances, and spatial representations causes a huge intraclass variation. In this article, an extreme learning machine (ELM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and scale transformation (ST)-based model, called improved extreme learning machine network, are proposed to detect traffic signs in real-time Cites: Learning discriminative projections for text similarity measures
