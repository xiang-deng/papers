Neural text-to-SQL models have achieved remarkable performance in translating natural language questions into SQL queries. However, recent studies reveal that text-to-SQL models are vulnerable to task-specific perturbations. Previous curated robustness test sets usually focus on individual phenomena. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive robustness benchmark 1 based on Spider, a cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmark, to diagnose the model robustness. We design 17  Cites: Opt: Open pre-trained transformer language models
