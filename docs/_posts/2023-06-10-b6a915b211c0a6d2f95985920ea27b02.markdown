Multifaceted, empirical evaluation of algorithmic ideas is one of the central pillars of Information Retrieval (IR) research. The IR community has a rich history of studying the effectiveness of indexes, retrieval algorithms, and complex machine learning rankers and, at the same time, quantifying their computational costs, from creation and training to application and inference. As the community moves towards even more complex deep learning models, questions on efficiency have once again  Cites: Pruning redundant mappings in transformer models via spectral
