Traditional collaborative filtering disregards the granularity of users  preference drifting and item popularity bias in modeling, thus diminished the accuracy of recommendation. This paper proposes a new collaborative filtering algorithm based on constrained random walk. Two new trust network: user-based and item-based are proposed, with Restricted Random Walk (RW) to adaptively track the change of users  preference drifting and item popularity bias. Experimental results on social …
