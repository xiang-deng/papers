Improving the predictive performance of machine learning models is the desired goal in many tasks and domains. The predictive performance of the learning algorithm is directly affected by the input features it receives. Feature augmentation is aimed at enhancing the quality of models by adding informative features to the original data. Explainable AI methods are typically used to explain the results of machine learning models. Recently, these methods have also been used to improve models predictive Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
