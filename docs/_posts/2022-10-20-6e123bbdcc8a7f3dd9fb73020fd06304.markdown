Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) tasks transcribe the input sequence to a target sequence. The Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion is widely used in multiple seq2seq tasks. Besides predicting the target sequence, a side product of CTC is to predict the alignment, which is the most probable input-long sequence that specifies a hard aligning relationship between the input and target units. As there are multiple potential aligning sequences (called paths) that are equally considered in  Cites: LegoNN: Building Modular Encoder-Decoder Models
