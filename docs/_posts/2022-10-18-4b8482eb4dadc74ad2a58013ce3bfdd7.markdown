Question Generation (QG) is a fundamental NLP task for many downstream applications. Recent studies on open-book QG, where supportive question-context pairs are provided to models, have achieved promising progress. However, generating natural questions under a more practical closed-book setting that lacks these supporting documents still remains a challenge. In this work, to learn better representations from semantic information hidden in question-answer pairs under Cites: GooAQ: Open question answering with diverse answer types
