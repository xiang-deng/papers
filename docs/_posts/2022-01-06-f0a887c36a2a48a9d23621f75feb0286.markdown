Applications in which researchers aim to extract a single land type from remotely sensed data are quite common in practical scenarios: extract the urban footprint to make connections with socio-economic factors; map the forest extent to subsequently retrieve biophysical variables and detect a particular crop type to successively calibrate and deploy yield prediction models. In this scenario, the (positive) targeted class is well defined, while the negative class is difficult to describe. This one-class Cites: Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder
