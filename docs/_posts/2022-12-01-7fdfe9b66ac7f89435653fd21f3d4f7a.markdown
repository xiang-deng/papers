Abstract Knowledge resources, eg knowledge graphs, which formally represent essential semantics and information for logic inference and reasoning, can compensate for the unawareness nature of many natural language processing techniques based on deep neural networks. This paper provides a focused review of the emerging but intriguing topic that fuses quality external knowledge resources in improving the performance of natural language processing tasks.
