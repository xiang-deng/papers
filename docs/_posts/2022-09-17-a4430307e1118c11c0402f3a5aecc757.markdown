Quality control is a crucial activity performed by manufacturing enterprises to ensure that their products meet quality standards and avoid potential damage to the brand s reputation. The decreased cost of sensors and connectivity enabled increasing digitalization of manufacturing. In addition, artificial intelligence enables higher degrees of automation, reducing overall costs and time required for defect inspection. This research compares three active learning approaches (with single Cites: Verified uncertainty calibration
