This study introduces a framework to extract the high-dimensional nonlinear relationships among state variables for aggregated convection. The prototype of such a framework is developed that applies the convolutional neural network models (CNN models) to retrieve the cloud characteristics from cloud-resolving model (CRM) simulations. CNN model prediction factors are hidden in the high dimensional weighted parameters in each neural network layer. Therefore, we can dig out Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
