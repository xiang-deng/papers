Despite the much discussed capabilities of today s language models, they are still prone to silly and unexpected commonsense failures.

Trained on~ 7M commonsense statements created from 19 QA datasets and two large-scale knowledge bases, and  Cites: Did aristotle use a laptop? a question answering benchmark with
