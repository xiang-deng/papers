With the dramatic development of deep learning in the past decade, interpretability has been one of the most important challenges that often prevents neural networks from being applied to fields such as finance. Among many existing explainable analyses, counterfactual generation has become widely used for understanding neural networks and making tailored recommendations. However, few studies are devoted to providing quantitative measures for evaluating counterfactuals. In this  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
