Previous studies show effective of pre-trained language models for sentiment analysis. However, most of these studies ignore the importance of sentimental information for pre-trained models. Therefore, we fully investigate the sentimental information for pre-trained models and enhance pre-trained language models with semantic graphs for sentiment analysis. In particular, we introduce Semantic Graphs based Pre-training (SGPT) using semantic graphs to obtain synonym knowledge for Cites: K-adapter: Infusing knowledge into pre-trained models with adapters
