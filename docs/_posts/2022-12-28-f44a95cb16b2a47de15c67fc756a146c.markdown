Most deep learning-based segmentation methods focus on accurate pixel-wise classification, disregarding higher order properties such as region connectivity, boundary smoothness, or the number of non-differentiable points on the object contour. To address these issues, we propose a new parameter-based object segmentation framework. Specifically, we represent the target object s boundary with parametric curves to handle the higher-order properties and find the parameters …
