Data sparsity is an important issue for click-through rate (CTR) prediction, particularly when user-item interactions is too sparse to learn a reliable model. Recently, many works on cross-domain CTR (CDCTR) prediction have been developed in an effort to leverage meaningful data from a related domain. However, most existing CDCTR works have an impractical limitation that requires homogeneous inputs (\textit {ie} shared feature fields) across domains, and CDCTR with heterogeneous inputs (\textit  Cites: LST: Ladder Side-Tuning for Parameter and Memory Efficient
