To improve the efficiency of program implementation, developers can selectively reuse the previously written code by searching the open-source codebase. To date, many code search methods have been proposed to actively push the limit of code search accuracy, where the methods designed using Self-Attention mechanism are particularly promising. However, while existing methods can improve the efficiency to capture textual semantics by attending significant words in the code component unit …
