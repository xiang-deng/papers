Knowledge graph completion is an important technology for supplementing knowledge graphs and improving data quality. However, the existing knowledge graph completion methods ignore the features of triple relations, and the introduced entity description texts are long and redundant. To address these problems, this study proposes a multi-task learning and improved TextRank for knowledge graph completion (MIT-KGC) model. The key contexts are first extracted from redundant …
