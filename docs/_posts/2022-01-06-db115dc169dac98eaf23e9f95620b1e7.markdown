Artificial Intelligence, as the hottest research topic nowadays, is mostly driven by data. There is no doubt that data is the king in the age of AI. However, natural high- quality data is precious and rare. In order to obtain enough and eligible data to support AI tasks, data processing is always required. To be even worse, the data preprocessing tasks are often dull and heavy, which require huge human labors to deal with. Statistics show 70%-80% of the data scientists time is spent on data Cites: Semantic adaptation of schema mappings when schemas evolve
