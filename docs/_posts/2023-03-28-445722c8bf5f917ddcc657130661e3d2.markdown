The process of creating animated films has traditionally been a time-consuming and labor-intensive endeavor. With the rapid onset of improvements in natural language processing (NLP), it is now possible to automate much of the film creation process, reducing the need for human involvement while still producing high-quality animated films. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to animated film generation in which, using a screenplay as the primary input, a user can create an animated film  Cites: Screenplay summarization using latent narrative structure
