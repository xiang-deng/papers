Semisupervised learning (SSL) has received a lot of recent attention as it alleviates the need for large amounts of labeled data which can often be expensive, requires expert knowledge, and be time consuming to collect. Recent developments in deep semisupervised classification have reached unprecedented performance and the gap between supervised and SSL is ever-decreasing. This improvement in performance has been based on the inclusion of numerous technical tricks, strong …
