Through using only a well-trained classifier, model-inversion (MI) attacks can recover the data used for training the classifier, leading to the privacy leakage of the training data. To defend against MI attacks, previous work utilizes a unilateral dependency optimization strategy, ie, minimizing the dependency between inputs (ie, features) and outputs (ie, labels) during training the classifier. However, such a minimization process conflicts with minimizing the supervised loss that aims to maximize the
