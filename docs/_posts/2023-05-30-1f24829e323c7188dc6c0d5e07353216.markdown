Estimating average causal effects is a common practice to test new treatments. However, the average effect masks important individual characteristics in the counterfactual distribution, which may lead to safety, fairness, and ethical concerns. This issue is exacerbated in the temporal setting, where the treatment is sequential and time-varying, leading to an intricate influence on the counterfactual distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel conditional generative modeling approach to  Cites: Causal effect variational autoencoder with uniform treatment
