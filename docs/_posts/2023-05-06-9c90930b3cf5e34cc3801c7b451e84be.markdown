Abstract Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in many scenarios. However, scalar-based features in GNN may be insufficient for the generation of graph representation via node representation, resulting in a lack of graph properties. Furthermore, the message aggregation operation of the original GNN suffers from not only a lack of global and structural information in graph but also the over-smoothing problem. As a result, we make efforts to alleviate the above Cites: Finetuning pretrained transformers into rnns
