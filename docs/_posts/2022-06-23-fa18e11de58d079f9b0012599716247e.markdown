Molecular representation learning, which aims to automate feature learning for molecules, is a vital task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Despite rapid advances in molecular pretraining models with various types of featurizations, from SMILES strings, 2D graphs to 3D geometry, there is a paucity of research on how to utilize different molecular featurization techniques to obtain better representations. To bridge that gap, we present a novel multiview contrastive …
