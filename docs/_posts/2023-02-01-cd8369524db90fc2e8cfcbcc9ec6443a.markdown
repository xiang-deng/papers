With the continuous development of humancomputer interaction, some industrial monitoring systems have gradually evolved from a single monitoring device to a comprehensive monitoring system platform, and multi-objective visual search is particularly important in the field of industrial monitoring. This study investigates the effect of conceptual and perceptual biases on similarity bias in multiple target visual searches and proposes relevant design strategies that can be applied to warning  Cites: Modeling action-level satisfaction for search task satisfaction
