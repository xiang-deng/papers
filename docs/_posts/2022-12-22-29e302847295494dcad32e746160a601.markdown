We study the problem of continually training an instruction-following agent through feedback provided by users during collaborative interactions. During interaction, human users instruct an agent using natural language, and provide realtime binary feedback as they observe the agent s instruction execution. We cast learning as a contextual bandit problem, converting the user feedback to immediate reward. We evaluate through multiple rounds of human-agent interactions, demonstrating 15.4 …
