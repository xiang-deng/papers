In the last few years, open-domain question answering (ODQA) has advanced rapidly due to the development of deep learning techniques and the availability of large-scale QA datasets. However, the current datasets are essentially designed for synchronic document collections (eg, Wikipedia). Temporal news collections such as long-term news archives spanning several decades, are rarely used in training the models despite they are quite valuable for our society.
