Large language models have ushered in a golden age of semantic parsing. The seq2seq paradigm allows for open-schema and abstractive attribute and relation extraction given only small amounts of finetuning data. Language model pretraining has simultaneously enabled great strides in natural language inference, reasoning about entailment and implication in free text. These advances motivate us to construct ImPaKT, a dataset for open-schema information extraction, consisting of  Cites: Open information extraction from the web
