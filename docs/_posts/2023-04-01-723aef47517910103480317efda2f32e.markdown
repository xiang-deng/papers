Graph representation learning has been a very active research area in recent years. The goal of graph representation learning is to generate representation vectors that accurately capture the structure and features of large graphs. This is especially important because the quality of the graph representation vectors will affect the performance of these vectors in downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Many techniques have been proposed for generating effective graph …
