Although automatic dialogue tutors hold great potential in making education personalized and more accessible, research on such systems has been hampered by a lack of sufficiently large and high-quality datasets. However, collecting such datasets remains challenging, as recording tutoring sessions raises privacy concerns and crowdsourcing leads to insufficient data quality. To address this problem, we propose a framework to semi-synthetically generate such dialogues by pairing real  Cites: SODA: Million-scale Dialogue Distillation with Social
