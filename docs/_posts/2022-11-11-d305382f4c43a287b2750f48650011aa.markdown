Vector semantics has slightly become a key tool for Natural Language Processing, especially concerning text analysis. This kind of vector representation is usually encoded through embeddings that can be used to encode semantic information at different levels of granularity. In fact, through the years, not only models for word embeddings have been developed, but also for sentence and documents. With this work we address sentence embeddings, in particular the non-parametric ones, which …
