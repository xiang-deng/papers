Large Language Models have shown tremendous performance on a large variety of natural language processing tasks, ranging from text comprehension to common sense reasoning. However, the mechanisms responsible for this success remain unknown, and it is unclear whether LLMs can achieve human-like cognitive capabilities or whether these models are still fundamentally limited. Abstract reasoning is a fundamental task for cognition, consisting of finding and applying a Cites: Beyond the Imitation Game: Quantifying and extrapolating the
