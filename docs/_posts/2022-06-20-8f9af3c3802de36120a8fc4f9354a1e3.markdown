During the last decade, several studies have been conducted to improve efficiency and robustness in the detection and segmentation of brain tumors based on different parameters like size, shape, location, and contrasts. This study proposes Multimodal Attention-gated Cascaded U-Net (MAC U-Net) model to address the performance issues observed in the detection and segmentation of low-grade tumors. The effectiveness of group normalization with attention gate is also explored with skip …
