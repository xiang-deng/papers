We propose Correct-N-Contrast (CNC), a contrastive learning method to improve robustness to spurious correlations when training group labels are unknown. Our motivating observation is that worst-group performance is related to a representation alignment loss, which measures the distance in feature space between different groups within each class. We prove that the gap between worst-group and average loss for each class is upper bounded by this alignment loss for that class. Thus, CNC Cites: Just train twice: Improving group robustness without training group
