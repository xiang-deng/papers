This work studies the semantic representations learned by BERT for compounds, that is, expressions such as sunlight or bodyguard. We build on recent studies that explore semantic information in Transformers at the word level and test whether BERT aligns with human semantic intuitions when dealing with expressions (eg, sunlight) whose overall meaning depends--to a various extent--on the semantics of the constituent words (sun, light). We leverage a dataset that includes human Cites: Composition in distributional models of semantics
