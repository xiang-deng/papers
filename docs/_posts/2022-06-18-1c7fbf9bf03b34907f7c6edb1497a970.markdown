Two key transcription factors (TFs) in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1) and BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1), belong to a small family with four BES1/BZR1 homologs (BEH14). To date, in contrast to the wealth of knowledge regarding BES1 and BZR1, little is known about BEH14. Here, we show that BEH2 was expressed preferentially in the roots and leaf margins including serrations  Cites: BRL1 and BRL3 are novel brassinosteroid receptors that function
