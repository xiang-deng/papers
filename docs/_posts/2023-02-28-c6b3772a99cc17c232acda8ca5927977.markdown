Bernstein s condition is a key assumption that guarantees fast rates in machine learning. For example, the Gibbs algorithm with prior $\pi $ has an excess risk in $ O (d_ {\pi}/n) $, as opposed to the standard $ O (\sqrt {d_ {\pi}/n}) $, where $ n $ denotes the number of observations and $ d_ {\pi} $ is a complexity parameter which depends on the prior $\pi $. In this paper, we examine the Gibbs algorithm in the context of meta-learning, ie, when learning the prior $\pi $ from $ T $ tasks (with $ n  Cites: Meta-Learning for Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation
