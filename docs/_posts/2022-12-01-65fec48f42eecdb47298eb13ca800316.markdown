Recent works on shared autonomy and assistive-AI technologies, such as assistive robot teleoperation, seek to model and help human users with limited ability in a fixed task. However, these approaches often fail to account for humans  ability to adapt and eventually learn how to execute a control task themselves. Furthermore, in applications where it may be desirable for a human to intervene, these methods may inhibit their ability to learn how to succeed with full self-control. In this paper, we …
