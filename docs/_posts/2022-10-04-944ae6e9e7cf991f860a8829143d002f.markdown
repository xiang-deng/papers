Differential privacy is the now de facto industry standard for ensuring privacy while publicly releasing statistics about a sensitive database. At a high level, differentially private algorithms add noise to the statistics they compute, so an adversary cannot with high confidence guess if any individual is in the database as any individual s effect on the statistics can be replicated by the noise. The fundamental paradigm in differential privacy is the privacy-accuracy trade-off: A differentially private algorithm s …
