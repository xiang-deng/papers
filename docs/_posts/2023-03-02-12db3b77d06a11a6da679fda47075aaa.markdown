We present Q-Cogni, an algorithmically integrated causal reinforcement learning framework that redesigns Q-Learning with an autonomous causal structure discovery method to improve the learning process with causal inference. Q-Cogni achieves optimal learning with a pre-learned structural causal model of the environment that can be queried during the learning process to infer cause-and-effect relationships embedded in a state-action space. We leverage on the sample efficient techniques of  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
