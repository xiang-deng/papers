We propose SP-NLG: A s emantic-p arsing-g uided n atural l anguage g eneration framework for logical content generation with high fidelity. Prior studies adopt large pretrained language models and coarse-to-fine decoding techniques to generate text with logic; while achieving considerable results on automatic evaluation metrics, they still face challenges in terms of logical fidelity based on human evaluation. Inspired by semantic parsing, which translates natural language utterances into executable Cites: Data-to-text generation with content selection and planning
