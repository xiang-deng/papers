Conversational recommender systems (CRS) explicitly solicit users  preferences for improved recommendations on the fly. Most existing CRS solutions employ reinforcement learning methods to train a single policy for a population of users. However, for users new to the system, such a global policy becomes ineffective to produce conversational recommendations, ie, the cold-start challenge. In this paper, we study CRS policy learning for cold-start users via meta reinforcement learning  Cites: Decoupling exploration and exploitation for meta-reinforcement
