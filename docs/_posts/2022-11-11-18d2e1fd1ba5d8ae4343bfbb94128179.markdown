Gated spiking neural P (GSNP) model is a recently developed recurrent-like network, which is abstracted by nonlinear spiking mechanism of nonlinear spiking neural P systems. In this study, a modification of GSNP is combined with attention mechanism to develop a novel model for sentiment classification, called attention-enabled GSNP model or termed as AGSNP model. The AGSNP model has two channels that process content words and aspect item respectively, where two modified GSNPs are  Cites: Aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network
