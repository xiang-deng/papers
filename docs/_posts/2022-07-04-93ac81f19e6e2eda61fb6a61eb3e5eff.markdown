Deep generative models (DGM) combine the deep neural networks with generative models to learn the underlying generation mechanism of the data of interest. This has emerged as a important approach to extracting knowledge from data in machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, there are many challenges to learning and applying DGMs in different domains despite their promising potential. Therefore, this thesis focuses on understanding, improving, and applying different deep Cites: Ctrl: A conditional transformer language model for controllable
