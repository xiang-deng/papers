The use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in engineering education can provide valuable insights into the underlying processes involved in generating text. While accessing these insights can be labor-intensive if done manually, recent advances in NLP and large language models have made it a realistic option for individuals. This study explores and evaluates a combination of clustering, summarization, and prompting techniques to analyze over 1,000 student essays in Cites: Measuring the carbon intensity of ai in cloud instances
