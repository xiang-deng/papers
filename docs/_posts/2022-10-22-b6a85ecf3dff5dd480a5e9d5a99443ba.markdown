This paper presents an empirical study to build relation extraction systems in low-resource settings. Based upon recent pre-trained language models, we comprehensively investigate three schemes to evaluate the performance in low-resource settings:(i) different types of prompt-based methods with few-shot labeled data;(ii) diverse balancing methods to address the long-tailed distribution issue;(iii) data augmentation technologies and self-training to generate more labeled in  Cites: Deep Unordered Composition Rivals Syntactic Methods for Text
