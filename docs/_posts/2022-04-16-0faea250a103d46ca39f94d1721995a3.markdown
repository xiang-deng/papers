Although artificial intelligence (AI; inclusive of machine learning) is gaining traction supporting climate change projections and impacts, limited work has used AI to address climate change adaptation. We identify this gap and highlight the value of AI especially in supporting complex adaptation choices and implementation. We illustrate how AI can effectively leverage precise, real-time information in data-scarce settings. We focus on supervised learning, transfer learning, reinforcement learning Cites: Wilds: A benchmark of in-the-wild distribution shifts
