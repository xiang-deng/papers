The number of text classification applications is increasing in parallel with the rise of artificial intelligence applications in the healthcare domain. It is vital to collect, classify, disseminate and manage information for applications used in healthcare systems. However, the process of classifying text data is of particular importance. In this chapter, we present several text classification techniques and algorithms used in healthcare systems. Also, we present a novel methodology to tune the text Cites: Electra: Pre-training text encoders as discriminators rather than
