In recent years, the employment of deep learning methods has led to several significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. Different from traditional machine learning models, deep learning-based approaches are able to extract features autonomously from raw data. This allows for bypassing the feature engineering process, which is generally considered to be both error-prone and tedious. Moreover, deep learning strategies often outperform traditional models in terms of …
