Companies and organizations often use manuals and guidelines to communicate and execute operational decisions. Decision Model and Notation (DMN) models can be used to model and automate these decisions. Modeling a decision from a textual source, however, is a time intensive and complex activity hence a need for shorter modeling times. This paper studies how NLP deep learning techniques can extract decision models from text faster. In this paper, we study and evaluate an automatic Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
