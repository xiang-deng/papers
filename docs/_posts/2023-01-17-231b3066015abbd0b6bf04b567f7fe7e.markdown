Language understanding is a key scientific issue in the fields of cognitive and computer science. However, the two disciplines differ substantially in the specific research questions. Cognitive science focuses on analyzing the specific mechanism of the brain and investigating the brain s response to language; few studies have examined the brain s language system as a whole. By contrast, computer scientists focus on the efficiency of practical applications when choosing research questions  Cites: Discourse representation structure parsing
