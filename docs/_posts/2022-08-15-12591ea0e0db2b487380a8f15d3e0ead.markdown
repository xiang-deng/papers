Debugging erroneous programs requires a great deal of human effort. To reduce human effort, automating debugging processes has been actively studied so far. One of such automation is automated program repair techniques for syntactic errors in programs. Researchers intend to support novice programmers such as students with these techniques because fixing syntactic errors is a difficult task for novice programmers. However, there exist few datasets that consist of programs written by Cites: Graph-based, self-supervised program repair from diagnostic
