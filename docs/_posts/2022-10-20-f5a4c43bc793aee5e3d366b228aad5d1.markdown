Randomized experiments (aka A/B tests) are a powerful tool for estimating treatment effects, to inform decisions making in business, healthcare and other applications. In many problems, the treatment has a lasting effect that evolves over time. A limitation with randomized experiments is that they do not easily extend to measure long-term effects, since running long experiments is time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we take a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that estimates the average …
