Knowledge graphs (KGs) consisting of a large number of triples have become widespread recently, and many knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods are proposed to embed entities and relations of a KG into continuous vector spaces. Such embedding methods simplify the operations of conducting various in-KG tasks (eg, link prediction) and out-of-KG tasks (eg, question answering). They can be viewed as general solutions for representing KGs. However, existing KGE methods …
