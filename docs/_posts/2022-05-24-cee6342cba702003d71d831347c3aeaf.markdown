Rule learning involves developing machine learning models that can be applied to a set of logical facts to predict additional facts, as well as providing methods for extracting from the learned model a set of logical rules that explain symbolically the model s predictions. Existing such approaches, however, do not describe formally the relationship between the model s predictions and the derivations of the extracted rules; rather, it is often claimed without justification that the extracted rules  Cites: Neural logic machines
