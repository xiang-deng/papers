As the complexity of power systems increases, traditional model-driven methods for online frequency stability prediction (FSP) encounter constraints in both accuracy and efficiency. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of FSP, an data-driven method using CoAtNet and SHAP values is proposed. By leveraging the combination of convolution and attention mechanisms, CoAtNet addresses the limitation of traditional deep learning approaches that may not be able to extract data features  Cites: Coatnet: Marrying convolution and attention for all data sizes
