A major limitation in applying deep learning to artificial intelligence (AI) systems is the scarcity of high-quality curated datasets. We investigate strong augmentation based self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to address this problem. Using breast cancer detection as an example, we first identify a mammogram-specific transformation paradigm and then systematically compare four recent SSL methods representing a diversity of approaches. We develop a method to convert a pretrained Cites: Meta-repository of screening mammography classifiers
