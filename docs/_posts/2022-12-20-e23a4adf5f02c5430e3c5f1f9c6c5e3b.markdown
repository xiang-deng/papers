Abstract Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms have resulted in state-of-the-art performance on Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. These algorithms typically require high-quality labeled datasets for training models. However, training NLP models effectively can suffer from issues such as scarcity of labeled data, data bias and under-representation, and privacy concerns with using sensitive data for training. Generating synthetic data to train models is a  Cites: Towards Robustifying NLI Models Against Lexical Dataset Biases
