Purpose Abundant studies of outpatient visits apply traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) approaches; more recent methods, such as the deep long short-term memory (DLSTM) model, have yet to be implemented in efforts to forecast key hospital data. Therefore, the current study aims to reports on an application of the DLSTM model to forecast multiple streams of healthcare data.
