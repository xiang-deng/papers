Over the years, the development of information technology applications, in particular, Artificial Intelligence has spurred the need to collect multi-view data on a large scale. Multi-view data, in general, is large, heterogeneous and uncertain, but also contains a lot of knowledge to mine and apply. Some of the single-view data clustering techniques have been improved to analyze multi-view data by extending the structure of the objective function or building associative models. Currently, multi … Cites: ‪Spectral clustering and transductive learning with multiple views‬
