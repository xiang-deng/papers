This study investigates machine translation between related languages ie, languages within the same family that share similar linguistic traits such as word order and lexical similarity. Machine translation through few-shot prompting leverages a small set of translation pair examples to generate translations for test sentences. This requires the model to learn how to generate translations while simultaneously ensuring that token ordering is maintained to produce a fluent and Cites: Data-to-text generation with variational sequential planning
