Previous works show that deep NLP models are not always conceptually sound: they do not always learn the correct linguistic concepts. Specifically, they can be insensitive to word order. In order to systematically evaluate models for their conceptual soundness with respect to word order, we introduce a new explanation method for sequential data: Order-sensitive Shapley Values (OSV). We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation to validate the method and surface how well various  Cites: Universal adversarial triggers for attacking and analyzing NLP
