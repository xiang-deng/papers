Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for hydrogen storage have continued to receive intense interest over the past several years. MOFs have attracted worldwide attention in the area of hydrogen energy, particularly for hydrogen storage. MOFs are a family of nanoporous materials and class of compounds. MOFs have higher surface area and porosity, low densities, flexible and tuneable porous structure, these are the attractive properties for gas storage. For these reasons MOFs have been extensively Cites: Theoretical limits of hydrogen storage in metalorganic
