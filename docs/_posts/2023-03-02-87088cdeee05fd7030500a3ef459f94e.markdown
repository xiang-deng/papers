Recently, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has achieved remarkable performance in graph representation learning. However, existing GCL methods usually follow a dual-channel encoder network (ie, Siamese networks), which adds to the complexity of the network architecture. Additionally, these methods overly depend on varied data augmentation techniques, corrupting graph information. Furthermore, they are heavily reliant on large quantities of negative nodes for each object node, which …
