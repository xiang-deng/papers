Deep neural networks (DNN) with incomparably advanced performance have been extensively applied in diverse fields (eg, image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition). Training a high-performance DNN model requires a lot of training data and intellectual and computing resources, which bring a high cost to the model owners. Therefore, illegal model abuse (model theft, derivation, resale or redistribution, etc.) seriously infringes model owners  legitimate …
