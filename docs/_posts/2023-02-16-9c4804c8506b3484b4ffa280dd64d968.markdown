This paper introduces a method called Sparsified Late Interaction for Multi-vector retrieval with inverted indexes (SLIM). Although multi-vector models have demonstrated their effectiveness in various information retrieval tasks, most of their pipelines require custom optimization to be efficient in both time and space. Among them, ColBERT is probably the most established method which is based on the late interaction of contextualized token embeddings of pre-trained language models Cites: Sparse, dense, and attentional representations for text retrieval
