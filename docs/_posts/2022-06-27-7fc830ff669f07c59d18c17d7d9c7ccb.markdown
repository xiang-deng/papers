COVID-19 has spread rapidly all over the world and has infected more than 200 countries and regions. Early screening of suspected infected patients is essential for preventing and combating COVID-19. Computed Tomography (CT) is a fast and efficient tool which can quickly provide chest scan results. To reduce the burden on doctors of reading CTs, in this article, a high precision diagnosis algorithm of COVID-19 from chest CTs is designed for intelligent diagnosis. A semi-supervised learning
