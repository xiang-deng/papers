Selective functionalization of the sterically hindered aromatic meta-C–H bond is unprecedented and remains to be a major challenge. Promoted by automation-based high-throughput experimentation (HTE) and deep learning (DL), a novel strategy to functionalize the hindered meta-C–H bond is disclosed. With carbon dioxide as a traceless director, a one-pot three-step protocol was developed to achieve selective arylation of o-alkylaryl ketones at the hindered meta position. This …
