Multi-agent reinforcement learning agents are typically trained in a single environment. As a consequence, they overfit to the training environment which results in sensitivity to perturbations and inability to generalise to similar environments. For multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches to be applicable in real-world scenarios, generalisation and robustness need to be addressed. However, unlike in supervised learning, generalisation lacks a clear definition in Cites: Decoupling exploration and exploitation for meta-reinforcement
