Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR)--answering complex logical queries over large knowledge graphs--represents an important artificial intelligence task, entailing a range of applications (eg, cyber threat hunting). However, despite its surging popularity, the potential security risks of KGR are largely unexplored, which is concerning, given the increasing use of such capability in security-critical domains. This work represents a solid initial step towards bridging the striking gap. We  Cites: Lego: Latent execution-guided reasoning for multi-hop question
