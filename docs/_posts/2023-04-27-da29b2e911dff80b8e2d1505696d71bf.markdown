An embedded system is a system consisting of software code, controller hardware, and I/O (Input/Output) hardware that performs a specific task. Developing an embedded system presents several challenges. First, the development often involves configuring hardware that requires domain-specific knowledge. Second, the library for the hardware may have API usage patterns that must be followed. To overcome such challenges, we propose a framework called ArduinoProg towards the automatic  Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
