The past decadeaka the neural erahas witnessed a substantial amount of research on representation learning for Knowledge Graphs (KGs)[52]. KGs store knowledge in the form of the so-called facts or triples (eg (head entity, relationship, tail entity)) and have been shown to be essential for enhancing several downstream applications (eg question answering [42], intelligent conversational agents [57], and recommender systems [73]). A common characteristic across most, if not all, of the Cites: Visual pivoting for (unsupervised) entity alignment
