A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system. Detecting and removing code smells is crucial for sustainable software development. However, manual detection can be daunting and time-consuming. Machine learning (ML) is a promising approach towards the automation of code smell detection. The first ML-based methods were classifiers trained on feature vectors comprising software metrics extracted by off-the-shelf tools.
