In recent years, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detection methods based on convolutional neural networks have attracted wide attention in remote sensing fields. However, these methods require a large number of labeled SAR images to train the network, where labeling for SAR images is more expensive and time-consuming than that for optical images. To address the problem of lacking labeled SAR images, in this paper, we proposed an unsupervised domain adaptation framework based on Cites: Understanding self-training for gradual domain adaptation
