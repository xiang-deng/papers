We hypothesize that existing sentence-level machine translation (MT) metrics become less effective when the human reference contains ambiguities. To verify this hypothesis, we present a very simple method for extending pretrained metrics to incorporate context at the document level. We apply our method to three popular metrics, BERTScore, Prism, and COMET, and to the reference free metric COMET-QE. We evaluate the extended metrics on the WMT 2021 metrics shared task using  Cites: A statistical analysis of summarization evaluation metrics using
