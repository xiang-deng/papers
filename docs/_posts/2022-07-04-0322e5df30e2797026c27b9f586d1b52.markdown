Sentiment analysis (SA) is widely applied in practical applications and known as emotion AI or opinion mining. In fact, SA tasks are really hard even for human; there are many factors that can affect the overall performance such as the length of the text, idiom, metaphor, or slang. In this paper, mainly proposed multi-channel word embeddings for SA consists of three parts: improving word representation, applying attention mechanism, and applying the state-of-the-art deep learning models Cites: Modeling mention, context and entity with neural networks for entity
