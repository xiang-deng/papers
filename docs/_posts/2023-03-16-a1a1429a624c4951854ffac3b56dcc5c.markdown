Large language models (LLMs) have recently taken the world by storm. They can generate coherent text, hold meaningful conversations, and be taught concepts and basic sets of instructionssuch as the steps of an algorithm. In this context, we are interested in exploring the application of LLMs to graph drawing algorithms by performing experiments on ChatGPT. These algorithms are used to improve the readability of graph visualizations. The probabilistic nature of LLMs presents  Cites: Emergent abilities of large language models
