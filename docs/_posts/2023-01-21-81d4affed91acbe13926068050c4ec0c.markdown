Natural language generation (NLG) has focused on data-to-text tasks with different structured inputs in recent years. The generated text should contain given information, be grammatically correct, and meet other criteria. We propose in this research an approach that combines solid pre-trained language models with input data augmentation. The studied data in this work are Universal Dependencies (UDs) which is developed as a framework for consistent annotation of grammar (parts of  Cites: Learning to generate product reviews from attributes
