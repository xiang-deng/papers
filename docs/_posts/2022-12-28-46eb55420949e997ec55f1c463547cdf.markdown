Abstract Machine Learning (ML) plays a crucial role in data analysis and data platforms (ie, integrated sets of technologies that collectively meet end-to-end data needs). In the last decade, we have witnessed an exponential growth in both the complexity and the number of ML techniques; leveraging such techniques to solve real-case problems has become difficult for Data Scientists. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) tools have been devised to alleviate this task, but easily became  Cites: PyGlove: Symbolic programming for automated machine learning
