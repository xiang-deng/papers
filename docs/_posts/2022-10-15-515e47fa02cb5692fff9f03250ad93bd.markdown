Designing in-depth educational questions is a time-consuming and cognitively demanding task. Therefore, it is intriguing to study how to build Question Generation (QG) models to automate the question creation process. However, existing QG datasets are not suitable for educational question generation because the questions are not real questions asked by humans during learning and can be solved by simply searching for information. To bridge this gap, we present KHANQ, a challenging …
