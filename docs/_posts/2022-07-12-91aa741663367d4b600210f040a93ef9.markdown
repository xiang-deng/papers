Session-based recommendation aims to predict next click action (eg, item) of anonymous users based on a fixed number of previous actions. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown superior performance in various applications. Inspired by the success of GNNs, tremendous endeavors have been devoted to introduce GNNs into session-based recommendation and have achieved significant results. Nevertheless, due to the highly diverse types of potential information in  Cites: Regularized evolution for image classifier architecture search
