The present work aims to carry out an analysis of the Amazon rain-forest deforestation, which can be analyzed from actual data and predicted by means of artificial intelligence algorithms. A hybrid machine learning model was implemented, using a dataset consisting of 760 Brazilian Amazon municipalities, with static data, namely geographical, forest, and watershed, among others, together with a time series data of annual deforestation area for the last 20 years (19992019).
