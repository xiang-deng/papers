Noisy partial label learning (noisy PLL) is an important branch of weakly supervised learning. Unlike PLL where the ground-truth label must reside in the candidate set, noisy PLL relaxes this constraint and allows the ground-truth label may not be in the candidate set. To address this problem, existing works attempt to detect noisy samples and estimate the ground-truth label for each noisy sample. However, detection errors are inevitable, and these errors will accumulate during training and  Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
