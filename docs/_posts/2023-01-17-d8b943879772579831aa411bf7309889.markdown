Traditional approaches to activity recognition involve the use of wearable sensors or cameras in order to recognise human activities. In this work, we extract fine-grained physical layer information from WiFi devices for the purpose of passive activity recognition in indoor environments. While such data is ubiquitous, few approaches are designed to utilise large amounts of unlabelled WiFi data. We propose the use of selfsupervised contrastive learning to improve activity recognition performance when Cites: Probing contextual language models for common ground with
