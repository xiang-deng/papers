Transfer learning (TL) is a method used in various fields of convolutional neural networks (CNN) based applications. TL provide the opportunity for CNN, able to learn with limited datasets. A generally used TL involves pre-trained model from large-scale datasets. Pre-trained model help prevent the restriction of performance from learn with limited datasets. There are many experiments on limited datasets, but few that assume small CNN models together. Limited-resources, which involves …
