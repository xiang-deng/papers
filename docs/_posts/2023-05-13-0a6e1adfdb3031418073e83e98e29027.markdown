Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are a type of knowledge representation that gained a lot of attention due to their ability to store information in a structured format. This structure representation makes KGs naturally suited for search engines and NLP tasks like question-answering (QA) and task-oriented systems; however, KGs are hard to construct. While QA datasets are more available and easier to construct, they lack structural representation. This availability of QA datasets made them a rich resource  Cites: Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text
