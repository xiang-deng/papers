Commonsense question answering has primarily been tackled through supervised transfer learning, where a language model pre-trained on large amounts of data is used as the starting point. While successful, the approach requires large amounts of labeled question-answer pairs, with increasingly larger amounts of data required as the complexity of scenarios or tasks such as commonsense QA increases. In this paper, we hypothesize that large-scale pre-training of language models encodes the …
