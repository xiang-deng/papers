Code generation models are gaining popularity because they can produce correct code from a prompt, speeding up the software development process. GitHub Copilot is currently one of the most commonly used tools for code generation. This tool is based on GPT3, a Large Language Model (LLM), and can perform zero-shot prompting tasks ie, tasks for which the model is not specifically trained. In this paper, we describe a preliminary study that investigates whether GitHub Copilot can predict …
