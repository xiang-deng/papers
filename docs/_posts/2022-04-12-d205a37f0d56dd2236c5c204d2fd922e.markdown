The advanced development of deep learning methods has recently made significant improvements in medical image segmentation. Encoderdecoder networks, such as U-Net, have addressed some of the challenges in medical image segmentation with an outstanding performance, which has promoted them to be the most dominating deep learning architecture in this domain. Despite their outstanding performance, we argue that they still lack some aspects. First, there is incompatibility in U-Net s skip Cites: Espnet: Efficient spatial pyramid of dilated convolutions for
