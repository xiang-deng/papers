Over the past few years, the field of adversarial attack received numerous attention from various researchers with the help of successful attack success rate against well-known deep neural networks that were acknowledged to achieve high classification ability in various tasks. However, majority of the experiments were completed under a single model, which we believe it may not be an ideal case in a real-life situation. In this paper, we introduce a novel federated adversarial training method for smart  Cites: Hidden Killer: Invisible Textual Backdoor Attacks with Syntactic
