Hydrogen offers a route to storing renewable electricity and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Metalorganic framework (MOF) adsorbents are promising candidates for hydrogen storage, but a deep understanding of their potential for large- scale, stationary back-up power applications has been lacking. Here we utilize techno-economic analysis and process modelling, which leverage molecular simulation and experimental results, to evaluate the future opportunities of MOF Cites: Theoretical limits of hydrogen storage in metalorganic
