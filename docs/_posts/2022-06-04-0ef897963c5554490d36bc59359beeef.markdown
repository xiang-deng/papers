Materials and Methods In this systematic review, the PubMed database was searched for peer-reviewed studies of DL algorithms for image-based radiologic diagnosis that included external validation, published from January 1, 2015, through April 1, 2021. Studies using nonimaging features or incorporating non-DL methods for feature extraction or classification were excluded. Two reviewers independently evaluated studies for inclusion, and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus … Cites: ‪Evaluation of combined artificial intelligence and radiologist …‬
