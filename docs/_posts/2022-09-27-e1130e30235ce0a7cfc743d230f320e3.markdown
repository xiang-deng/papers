Modern machine learning research relies on relatively few carefully curated datasets. Even in these datasets, and typically inuntidy or raw data, practitioners are faced with significant issues of data quality and diversity which can be prohibitively labor intensive to address. Existing methods for dealing with these challenges tend to make strong assumptions about the particular issues at play, and often require a priori knowledge or metadata such as domain labels.
