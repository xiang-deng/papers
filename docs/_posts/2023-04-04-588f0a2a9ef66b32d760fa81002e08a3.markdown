Abstract Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL) intends to identify records that match the same real-world entities across disparate data sources while preserving the privacy of the individual entities. To identify matching records across different data sources and still preserve the privacy of the information, PPRL needs to consider several restrictions due to privacy limitations. For instance, PPRL is executed over anonymized (or encrypted) data to avoid re-identification. Moreover Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
