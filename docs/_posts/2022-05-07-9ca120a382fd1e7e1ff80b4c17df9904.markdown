In recent years, quantum computers and algorithms have made significant progress indicating the prospective importance of quantum computing (QC). Especially combinatorial optimization has gained a lot of attention as an application field for near-term quantum computers, both by using gate-based QC via the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and by quantum annealing using the Ising model. However, demonstrating an advantage over classical methods in real-world Cites: Enabling certification of verification-agnostic networks via memory
