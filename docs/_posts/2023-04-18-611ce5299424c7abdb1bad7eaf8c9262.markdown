We marry two powerful ideas: decision tree ensemble for rule induction and abstract argumentation for aggregating inferences from diverse decision trees to produce better predictive performance and intrinsically interpretable than state-of-the-art ensemble models. Our approach called Arguing Tree Ensemble is a self-explainable model that first learns a group of decision trees from a given dataset. It then treats all decision trees as knowledgable agents and let them argue each other for concluding …
