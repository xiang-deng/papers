We consider the problem of predicting link formation in Social Learning Networks (SLN), a type of social network that forms when people learn from one another through structured interactions. While link prediction has been studied for general types of social networks, the evolution of SLNs over their lifetimes coupled with their dependence on which topics are being discussed presents new challenges for this type of network. To address these challenges, we develop a series of autonomous Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
