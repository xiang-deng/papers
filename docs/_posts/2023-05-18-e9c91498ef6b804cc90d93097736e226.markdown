This paper presents $\mathrm {E}(n) $ Equivariant Message Passing Simplicial Networks (EMPSNs), a novel approach to learning on geometric graphs and point clouds that is equivariant to rotations, translations, and reflections. EMPSNs can learn high-dimensional simplex features in graphs (eg triangles), and use the increase of geometric information of higher-dimensional simplices in an $\mathrm {E}(n) $ equivariant fashion. EMPSNs simultaneously generalize $\mathrm {E}(n) …
