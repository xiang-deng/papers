The current evaluation tests for AGI/GPT large language models (LLM) such as general artificial intelligence (AGI) and generative pre-training Transformer (GPT) are mostly limited to the subjective cognitive experience of testers on AI intelligence understanding, and are implemented as corresponding tests instance. The overall reflection of these tests on the intelligence capabilities of AGI/GPT is often fragmented and unsystematic, so it is a black-box test mode. This paper is based on Cites: Sparks of artificial general intelligence: Early experiments with gpt-4
