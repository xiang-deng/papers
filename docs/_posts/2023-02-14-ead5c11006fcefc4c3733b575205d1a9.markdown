The classification of domain entities into top-level ontology concepts remains an activity performed manually by an ontology engineer. Although some works focus on automating this task by applying machine-learning approaches using textual sentences as input, they require the existence of the domain entities in external knowledge resources, such as pre-trained embedding models. In this context, this work proposes an approach that combines the term representing the domain entity Cites: Electra: Pre-training text encoders as discriminators rather than
