A key challenge for Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is to distinguish semantically similar emotions. Some works utilise Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) which uses categorical emotion labels as supervision signals and contrasts in high-dimensional semantic space. However, categorical labels fail to provide quantitative information between emotions. ERC is also not equally dependent on all embedded features in the semantic space, which makes the high-dimensional SCL …
