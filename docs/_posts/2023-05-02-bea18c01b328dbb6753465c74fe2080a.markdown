The event extraction task typically consists of event detection and event argument extraction. Most previous work models these two subtasks with shared representation by multiple classification tasks or a unified generative approach. In this paper, we revisit this pattern and propose to use independent encoders to model event detection and event argument extraction, respectively, and use the output of event detection to construct the input of event argument extraction.
