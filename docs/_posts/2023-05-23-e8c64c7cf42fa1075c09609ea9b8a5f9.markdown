Over the past few years, the software engineering (SE) community has widely employed deep learning (DL) techniques in many source code processing tasks. Similar to other domains like computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), the state‐of‐the‐art DL techniques for source code processing can still suffer from adversarial vulnerability, where minor code perturbations can mislead a DL model s inference. Efficiently detecting such vulnerability to expose the risks at an …
