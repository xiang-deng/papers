Cross-network node classification (CNNC), which aims to classify nodes in a label-deficient target network by transferring the knowledge from a source network with abundant labels, draws increasing attention recently. To address CNNC, we propose a domain-adaptive message passing graph neural network (DM-GNN), which integrates graph neural network (GNN) with conditional adversarial domain adaptation. DM-GNN is capable of learning informative representations for node  Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
