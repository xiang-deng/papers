Context: The correct prediction of long-lived bugs could help maintenance teams to build their plan and to fix more bugs that often adversely affect software quality and disturb the user experience across versions in Free/Libre Open-Source Software (FLOSS). Machine Learning and Text Mining methods have been applied to solve many real-world prediction problems, including bug report handling. Objective: Our research aims to compare the accuracy of ML classifiers on long-lived bug prediction  Cites: Well-read students learn better: On the importance of pre-training
