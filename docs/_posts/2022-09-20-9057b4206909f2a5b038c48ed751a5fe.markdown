With the substantial progress of deep learning techniques, learning from data and automating repetitive tasks are increasingly explored in multiple fields ranging from decision making to scientific experiments. Datasets represent a particular form of data that is explored in the data science field where the objective of learning from datasets is to extract useful knowledge for developing data-driven solutions. The process of generating useful knowledge from datasets starts with a first step that …
