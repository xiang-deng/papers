The discovery of neural architectures from scratch is the long-standing goal of Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Searching over a wide spectrum of neural architectures can facilitate the discovery of previously unconsidered but well-performing architectures. In this work, we take a large step towards discovering neural architectures from scratch by expressing architectures algebraically. This algebraic view leads to a more general method for designing search spaces, which allows us  Cites: Searching for Efficient Transformers for Language Modeling
