Abstract Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) regresses a neural parameterized scene by differentially rendering multi-view images with ground-truth supervision. However, when interpolating novel views, NeRF often yields inconsistent and visually non-smooth geometric results, which we consider as a generalization gap between seen and unseen views. Recent advances in convolutional neural networks have demonstrated the promise of advanced robust data augmentations, either random or …
