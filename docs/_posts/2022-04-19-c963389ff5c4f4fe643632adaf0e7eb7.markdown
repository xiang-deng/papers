Screening mammography improves breast cancer outcomes by enabling early detection and treatment. However, false positive callbacks for additional imaging from screening exams cause unnecessary procedures, patient anxiety, and financial burden. This work demonstrates an AI algorithm that reduces false positives by identifying mammograms not suspicious for breast cancer. We trained the algorithm to determine the absence of cancer using 123,248 2D digital mammograms (6,161 Cites: Evaluation of combined artificial intelligence and radiologist
