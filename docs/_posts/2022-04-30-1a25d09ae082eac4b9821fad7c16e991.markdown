Ranking responses for a given dialogue context is a popular benchmark in which the setup is to re-rank the ground-truth response over a limited set of $ n $ responses, where $ n $ is typically 10. The predominance of this setup in conversation response ranking has lead to a great deal of attention to building neural re-rankers, while the first-stage retrieval step has been overlooked. Since the correct answer is always available in the candidate list of $ n $ responses, this artificial evaluation setup Cites: Domain-matched pre-training tasks for dense retrieval
