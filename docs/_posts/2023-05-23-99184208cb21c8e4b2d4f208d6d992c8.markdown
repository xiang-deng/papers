In this thesis, we explore the various ways in which differential equations and reduced-order modeling can be applied in the context of deep learning. The work is divided into two main parts. The first part is about neural ordinary differential equations, a type of neural network architecture that uses systems of ordinary differential equations as a fundamental building block. We propose a new interpolation-based algorithm for efficient and memory-effective training of these …
