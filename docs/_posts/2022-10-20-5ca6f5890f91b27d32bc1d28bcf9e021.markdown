The Neo4j query language Cypher enables efficient querying for graphs and has become the most popular graph database language. Due to its complexities, semantic parsing (similar to Text-to-SQL) that translates natural language queries to Cypher becomes highly desirable. We propose the first Text-to-CQL dataset, SpCQL, which contains one Neo4j graph database, 10,000 manually annotated natural language queries and the matching Cypher queries (CQL). Correspondingly, based Cites: Rat-sql: Relation-aware schema encoding and linking for text-to
