1 these trained vectors represents the spintronics knowledge and the pattern obtained from the cosine distances between various materials names and the word spin-orbit torque correctly estimated the spin-orbit torque efficiencies in various known materials. In addition, the model predicted 32 new spin-orbit torque materials, where 9 of them are expected to exhibit a spin-orbit torque efficiency much greater than unity, with the largest expected value of 36.4.
