While neural networks have shown remarkable success on classification tasks in terms of average-case performance, they often fail to perform well on certain groups of the data. Such group information may be expensive to obtain; thus, recent works in robustness and fairness have proposed ways to improve worst-group performance even when group labels are unavailable for the training data. However, these methods generally underperform methods that utilize group information at training Cites: Just train twice: Improving group robustness without training group
