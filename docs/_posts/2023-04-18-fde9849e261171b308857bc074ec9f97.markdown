Adversarial attacks can help to reveal the vulnerability of neural networks. In the text classification domain, synonym replacement is an effective way to generate adversarial examples. However, the number of replacement combinations grows exponentially with the text length, making the search difficult. In this work, we propose an attack method which combines a synonym selection network and search strategies of beam search and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The synonym …
