Code comments generation is a multi-disciplinary research, involving many different fields such as software engineering and natural language processing. In general, the automatic generation of code comments takes the source code as the input and its corresponding natural language description as outputs. In previous work, the code is regarded as a sequence and modeled by sequence models such as RNN, ignoring the data flow between variables and long-range dependencies in the code  Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
