In the field of software engineering, applying language models to the token sequence of source code is the state-of-the-art approach to building a code recommendation system. When applying language models to source code, it is difficult for state-of-the-art language models to deal with the data inconsistency problem, which is caused by the free naming conventions of source code. It is common for user-defined variables or methods with similar semantics in source …
