Search result diversification focuses on reducing redundancy and improving subtopic richness in the results for a given query. Most existing approaches measure document diversity mainly based on text or pre-trained representations. However, some underlying relationships between the query and documents are difficult for the model to capture only from the content. Given that the knowledge base can offer well-defined entities and explicit relationships between entities, we exploit knowledge to Cites: ERNIE: Enhanced Language Representation with Informative
