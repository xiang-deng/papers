A variety of planning research is being actively conducted in multiple research fields. The focus of these studies is to flexibly utilize both immediate and deliberative planning in response to the environment and to adaptively prioritize multiple goals and actions in a human-like manner. To achieve this, a method that applies active propagation to multi-agent planning (agent activation spreading network) has been proposed and is being utilized in various research fields. Furthermore, with the …
