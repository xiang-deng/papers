The coordinated signaling activity of auxin and brassinosteroids (BRs) is critical for optimal plant growth and development. Nutrient-derived signals regulate root growth by modulating the levels and spatial distribution of growth hormones to optimize nutrient uptake and assimilation. However, the effect of the interaction of these two hormones and their signaling on root plasticity during low and differential availability of nitrogen (N) forms (NH4+/NO3-) remains elusive. We demonstrate that root Cites: BRL1 and BRL3 are novel brassinosteroid receptors that function
