Software clones are often introduced when developers reuse code fragments to implement similar functionalities in the same or different software systems. Many high-performing clone detection tools today are based on deep learning techniques and are mostly used for detecting clones written in the same programming language, whereas clone detection tools for detecting cross-language clones are also emerging rapidly.
