A machine learning model for correcting errors in Ukrainian texts has been developed. It was established that the neural network has the ability to correct simple sentences written in Ukrainian; however, the development of a full-fledged system requires the use of spell-checking using dictionaries and the checking of rules, both simple and those based on the result of parsing dependencies or other features. In order to save computing resources, a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder …
