Automated program repair (APR) aims to reduce the effort of software development. With the development of deep learning, lots of DL-based APR approaches have been proposed using an encoder-decoder architecture. Despite the promising performance, these models share the same limitation: generating lots of untypable patches. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the existing models do not consider the constraints of code captured by a set of typing rules.
