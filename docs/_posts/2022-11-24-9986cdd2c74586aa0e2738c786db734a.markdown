Multi-label text classification (MLTC) is one of the key tasks in natural language processing. It aims to assign multiple target labels to one document. Due to the uneven popularity of labels, the number of documents per label follows a long-tailed distribution in most cases. It is much more challenging to learn classifiers for data-scarce tail labels than for data-rich head labels. The main reason is that head labels usually have sufficient information, eg, a large intra-class diversity, while tail labels …
