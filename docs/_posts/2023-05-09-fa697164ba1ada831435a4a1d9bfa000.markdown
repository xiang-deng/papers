Tailoring outputs of large language models, such as ChatGPT, to specific user needs remains a challenge despite their impressive generation quality. In this paper, we propose a tri-agent generation pipeline consisting of a generator, an instructor, and an editor to enhance the customization of generated outputs. The generator produces an initial output, the user-specific instructor generates editing instructions, and the editor generates a revised output aligned with user preferences.
