Building new, powerful data-driven defenses against prevalent software vulnerabilities needs sizable, quality vulnerability datasets, so does large-scale benchmarking of existing defense solutions. Automatic data generation would promisingly meet the need, yet there is little work aimed to generate muchneeded quality vulnerable samples. Meanwhile, existing similar and adaptable techniques suffer critical limitations for that purpose. In this paper, we present VULGEN, the first  Cites: Learning structural edits via incremental tree transformations
