Open-world classification in dialog systems require models to detect open intents, while ensuring the quality of in-domain (ID) intent classification. In this work, we revisit methods that leverage distance-based statistics for unsupervised out-of- domain (OOD) detection. We show that despite their superior performance on threshold-independent metrics like AUROC on test-set, threshold values chosen based on the performance on a validation-set do not generalize well to the test-set Cites: Discriminative nearest neighbor few-shot intent detection by
