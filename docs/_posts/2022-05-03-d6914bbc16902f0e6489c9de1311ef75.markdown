Cross-target stance detection (CTSD) aims to identify the stance of the text towards a target, where stance annotations are available for (though related but) different targets. Recently, models based on external semantic and emotion knowledge have been proposed for CTSD, achieving promising performance. However, such solutions rely on much external resources and harness only one source target, which is a waste of other available targets. To address the problem above, we propose a Cites: Well-read students learn better: On the importance of pre-training
