Seismic internal multiples are the key factors affecting the accuracy and reliability of velocity analysis and migration. The removal of internal multiples is a challenging direction. To effectively remove the internal multiples from the seismic data, we propose the unsupervised deep neural network (DNN) combined with the adaptive virtual events (AVE) method. First, we use the AVE method to get the predicted internal multiples, which can calibrate the true internal multiples in the original data Cites: Fully Character-Level Neural Machine Translation without Explicit
