Blueprint is a declarative domain-specific language for document extraction. Users describe document layout using spatial, textual, semantic, and numerical fuzzy constraints, and the language runtime extracts the field-value mappings that best satisfy the constraints in a given document. We used Blueprint to develop several document extraction solutions in a commercial setting. This approach to the extraction problem proved powerful. Concise Blueprint programs were able to Cites: Webtables: exploring the power of tables on the web
