We study the problem of few-shot Fine-grained Entity Typing (FET), where only a few annotated entity mentions with contexts are given for each entity type. Recently, prompt-based tuning has demonstrated superior performance to standard fine-tuning in few-shot scenarios by formulating the entity type classification task as a fill-in-the-blank problem. This allows effective utilization of the strong language modeling capability of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs).
