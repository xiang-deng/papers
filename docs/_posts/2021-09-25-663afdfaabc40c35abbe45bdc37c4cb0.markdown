Named entity recognition (NER) is an important task in natural language processing (NLP). Until the revival of neural network based models for NLP, NER taggers employed traditional machine learning approaches or finite-state transducers to detect the entities in a given sentence. Neural models improved the state-of-the-art performance with sequence-based models and word embeddings. These approaches neglect the morphological information embedded in the surface forms of Cites: StructVAE: Tree-structured latent variable models for semi
