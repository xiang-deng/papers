Sentiment analysis for user reviews has received substantial heed in recent years. There are many deep learning models for natural language processing (NLP) applications. Long-short term memory (LSTM) and Convolutional neural network (CNN) based models efficiently enhance sentiment accuracy. Aspect-level sentiment analysis involves aspect extraction, aspect categorization, and polarity classification. The aspect sentiments in the dataset are classified as positive, negative, and neutral Cites: Cached Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks for Document
