Deep networks are prone to performance degradation when there is a domain shift between the source (training) data and target (test) data. Recent test-time adaptation methods update batch normalization layers of pre-trained source models deployed in new target environments with streaming data to mitigate such performance degradation. Although such methods can adapt on-the-fly without first collecting a large target domain dataset, their performance is dependent on streaming conditions  Cites: Wilds: A benchmark of in-the-wild distribution shifts
