In recent years, more and more visualization methods for explanations of artificial intelligence have been proposed that focus on untangling black box models for single instances of the data set. While the focus often lies on supervised learning algorithms, the study of uncertainty estimations in the unsupervised domain for high-dimensional data sets in the explainability domain has been neglected so far. As a result, existing visualization methods struggle to visualize global uncertainty patterns Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
