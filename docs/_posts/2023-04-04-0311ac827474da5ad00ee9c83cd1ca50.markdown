The paraphrase generator for citation sentences is used to produce several sentence alternatives to avoid plagiarism. Furthermore, the generation results need to pay attention to semantic similarity and lexical divergence standards. This study proposed the StoPGEN model as an algorithm for generating citation paraphrase sentences with stochastic output. The generation process is guided by an objective function using a simulated annealing algorithm to maintain the properties of semantic  Cites: Paraphrasing revisited with neural machine translation
