Key Information Extraction (KIE) is aimed at extracting structured information (eg key-value pairs) from form-style documents (eg invoices), which makes an important step towards intelligent document understanding. Previous approaches generally tackle KIE by sequence tagging, which faces difficulty to process non-flatten sequences, especially for table-text mixed documents. These approaches also suffer from the trouble of pre-defining a fixed set of labels for each type of documents, as well as the Cites: DROP: A Reading Comprehension Benchmark Requiring Discrete
