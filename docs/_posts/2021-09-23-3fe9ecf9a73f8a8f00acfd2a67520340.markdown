Detailed kinetic modeling describes a complex chemical system in terms of thousands of intermediate elementary reaction steps occurring between hundreds of short lived species. Many chemical systems in combustion, atmospheric chemistry, and heterogeneous catalysis are described using detailed kinetic models. Building detailed kinetic models manually is error prone and requires a significant amount of human time.
