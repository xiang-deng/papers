In this paper, we explore the challenging problem of performing a generative task (ie, summarization) in a target language when labeled data is only available in English. We assume a strict setting with no access to parallel data or machine translation. Prior work has shown, and we confirm, that standard transfer learning techniques struggle in this setting, as a generative multilingual model fine-tuned purely on English catastrophically forgets how to generate non-English. Given the recent rise of … Cites: ‪Metaicl: Learning to learn in context‬
