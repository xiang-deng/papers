A fundamental task for knowledge graphs (KGs) is knowledge graph completion (KGC). It aims to predict unseen edges by learning representations for all the entities and relations in a KG. A common concern when learning representations on traditional graphs is degree bias. It can affect graph algorithms by learning poor representations for lower-degree nodes, often leading to low performance on such nodes. However, there has been limited research on whether there exists degree …
