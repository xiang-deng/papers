Most uses of machine learning today involve training a model from scratch for a particular task, or sometimes starting with a model pretrained on a related task and then fine-tuning on a downstream task. Both approaches offer limited knowledge transfer between different tasks, time-consuming human-driven customization to individual tasks and high computational costs especially when starting from randomly initialized models. We propose a method that uses the layers of a Cites: Chip placement with deep reinforcement learning
