Multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to pinpoint answer entities by reasoning across multiple triples in knowledge graphs (KGs). To enhance model interpretability, reinforcement learning (RL) based methods are proposed. However, RL-based solutions suffer from two major issues. The first is aimless exploration due to the limited observation information. The second is delayed and sparse rewards caused by weak supervision. To bridge the gap, we propose an …
