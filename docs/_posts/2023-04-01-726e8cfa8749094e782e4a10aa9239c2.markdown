End-to-end deep learning models are increasingly applied to safety-critical human activity recognition (HAR) applications, eg, healthcare monitoring and smart home control, to reduce developer burden and increase the performance and robustness of prediction models. However, integrating HAR models in safety-critical applications requires trust, and recent approaches have aimed to balance the performance of deep learning models with explainable decision-making for complex activity …
