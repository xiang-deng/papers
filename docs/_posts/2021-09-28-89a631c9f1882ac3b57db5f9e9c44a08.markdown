In safety-critical machine learning applications, it is crucial to defend models against adversarial attacks--small modifications of the input that change the predictions. Besides rigorously studied $ ell_p $-bounded additive perturbations, recently proposed semantic perturbations (eg rotation, translation) raise a serious concern on deploying ML systems in real-world. Therefore, it is important to provide provable guarantees for deep learning models against semantically meaningful input Cites: Semidefinite relaxations for certifying robustness to adversarial
