With the rapid development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), log-based anomaly detection has become vital for smart industrial construction that has prompted many researchers to contribute. To detect anomalies based on log data, semi-supervised approaches stand out from supervised and unsupervised approaches because they only require a portion of labeled data and are relatively stable. However, the state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches still suffer from two Cites: Text summarization with pretrained encoders
