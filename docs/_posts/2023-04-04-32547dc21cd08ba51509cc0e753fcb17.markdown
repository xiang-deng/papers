Knowledge graph (KG) technology is a newly emerged knowledge representation method in the field of artificial intelligence. Knowledge graphs can form logical mappings from cluttered data and establish triadic relationships between entities. Accurate derivation and reasoning of knowledge graphs play an important role in guiding power equipment operation and decision-making. Due to the complex and weak relations from multi-source heterogeneous data, the use of KGs has become …
