We demonstrate an AI assisted data labeling system which applies unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning to facilitate accurate and efficient labeling of large data sets. Our system (1) applies representative data sampling and active learning in order to seed and maintain a semi-supervised learner that assists the human labeler (2) provides visual labeling assistance and optimizes labeling mechanics using predicted labels (3) seamlessly updates and learns from ongoing Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
