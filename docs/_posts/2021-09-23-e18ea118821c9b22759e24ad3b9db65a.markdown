Regular Expression (RE) matching is a computational kernel used in several applications. Since RE complexity and data volumes are steadily increasing, hardware acceleration is gaining attention also for this problem. Existing approaches have limited flexibility as they require a different implementation for each RE. On the other hand, it is complex to map efficient RE representations like non-deterministic finite-state automata onto software-programmable engines or parallel architectures Cites: HARE: Hardware accelerator for regular expressions
