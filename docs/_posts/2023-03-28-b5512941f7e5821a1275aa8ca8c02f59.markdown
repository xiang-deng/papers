Large language models have demonstrated surprising ability to perform in-context learning, ie, these models can be directly applied to solve numerous downstream tasks by conditioning on a prompt constructed by a few input-output examples. However, prior research has shown that in-context learning can suffer from high instability due to variations in training examples, example order, and prompt formats. Therefore, the construction of an appropriate prompt is essential for improving the  Cites: Fantastically ordered prompts and where to find them: Overcoming
