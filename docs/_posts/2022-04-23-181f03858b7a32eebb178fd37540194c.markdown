Question answering on knowledge bases (KBQA) poses a unique challenge for semantic parsing research due to two intertwined factors: large search space and ambiguities in schema linking. The predominant ranking-based KBQA models, which rely on a candidate enumeration step to reduce the search space, struggle with flexibility and have impractical online running time. In this paper, we present ArcaneQA, a novel generation-based model that addresses both the large search Cites: UnifiedSKG: Unifying and Multi-Tasking Structured Knowledge
