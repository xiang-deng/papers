We target the problem of automatically synthesizing proofs of semantic equivalence between two programs made of sequences of statements. We represent programs using abstract syntax trees (AST), where a given set of semantics-preserving rewrite rules can be applied on a specific AST pattern to generate a transformed and semantically equivalent program. In our system, two programs are equivalent if there exists a sequence of application of these rewrite rules that leads to rewriting one …
