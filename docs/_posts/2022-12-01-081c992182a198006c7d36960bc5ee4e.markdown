Text matching is a fundamental research problem in natural language understanding. Interaction-based approaches treat the text pair as a single sequence and encode it through cross encoders, while representation-based models encode the text pair independently with siamese or dual encoders. Interactionbased models require dense computations and thus are impractical in real-world applications. Representation-based models have become the mainstream paradigm for efficient  Cites: BoolQ: Exploring the Surprising Difficulty of Natural Yes/No
