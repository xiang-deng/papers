An Entity Linking system aligns the textual mentions of entities in a text to their corresponding entries in a knowledge base.

In this work, we present a neural entity linking system that connects the product and organization type entities in business conversations to their corresponding Wikipedia and Wikidata entries. The proposed system leverages Cites: Scalable zero-shot entity linking with dense entity retrieval
