This paper investigates a new research task in multimedia analysis, dubbed as Video2Subtitle. The goal of this task is to finding the most plausible subtitle from a large pool for a querying video clip. We assume that the temporal duration of each sentence in a subtitle is unknown. Compared with existing cross-modal matching tasks, the proposed Video2Subtitle confronts several new challenges. In particular, video frames/subtitle sentences are temporally ordered, respectively, yet no precise …
