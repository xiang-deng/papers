Decoupling has become a new paradigm in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for its effectiveness and scalability. However, this paradigm still faces two several restrictions: unsatisfying propagation, caused by noisy or confused edges, could greatly degrade model performance; fixed aggregation schema with the same propagation steps and the same combination weights for each node limit achieving optimal performance. To address these problems, we propose a novel decoupled Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
