This paper proposes a new method of impact classification for a Structural Health Monitoring system through the use of Self-Attention, the central building block of the Transformer neural network. As a topical and highly promising neural network architecture, the Transformer has the potential to greatly improve the speed and robustness of impact detection. This paper investigates the suitability of this new network, confronting the advantages and disadvantages offered by the Transformer …
