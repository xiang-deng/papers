Recently, the response selection for retrieval-based dialogue systems has gained enormous attention from both academic and industrial communities. Although the previous methods achieve promising results for intelligent customer service systems and open-domain chatbots, the response selection in medical dialogues suffers from lower performance because of the strong dependency on the domain knowledge. In this paper, we construct two specialized medical knowledge bases and propose a Cites: A knowledge-grounded neural conversation model
