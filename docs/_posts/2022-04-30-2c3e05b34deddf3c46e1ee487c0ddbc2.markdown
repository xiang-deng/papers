Technology for open-ended language generation, a key application of artificial intelligence, has advanced to a great extent in recent years. Large-scale language models, which are trained on large corpora of text, are being used in a wide range of applications everywhere, from virtual assistants to conversational bots. While these language models output fluent text, existing research shows that these models can and do capture human biases. Many of these biases, especially those that could Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
