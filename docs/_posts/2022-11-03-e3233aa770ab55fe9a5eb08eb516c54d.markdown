Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform well in answering questions and in producing long-form texts, both in few-shot closed-book settings. While the former can be validated using well-known evaluation metrics, the latter is difficult to evaluate. We resolve the difficulties to evaluate long-form output by doing both tasks at once--to do question answering that requires long-form answers. Such questions tend to be multifaceted, ie, they may have ambiguities and/or require …
