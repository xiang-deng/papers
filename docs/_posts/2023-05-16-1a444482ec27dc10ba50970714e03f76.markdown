Dense text retrieval has become a widely used paradigm for recalling existing language models, and efficient dense text retrieval is essential for obtaining sufficiently accurate candidate samples. However, the existing methods for dense text retrieval, which typically use dual-encoder architectures to match similar queries and documents, suffer from a lack of information interaction at low data volumes, resulting in suboptimal performance. Additionally, existing research relies on …
