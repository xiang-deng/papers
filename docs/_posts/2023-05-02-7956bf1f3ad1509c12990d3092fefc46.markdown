We present FewShotTextGCN, a novel method designed to effectively utilize the properties of word-document graphs for improved learning in low-resource settings. We introduce K-hop Neighbourhood Regularization, a regularizer for heterogeneous graphs, and show that it stabilizes and improves learning when only a few training samples are available. We furthermore propose a simplification in the graph-construction method, which results in a graph that is∼ 7 times less dense and yields …
