The relational triplet is a format to represent relational facts in the real world, which consists of two entities and a semantic relation between these two entities. Since the relational triplet is the essential component in a knowledge graph (KG), extracting relational triplets from unstructured texts is vital for KG construction and has attached increasing research interest in recent years. In this work, we find that relation correlation is common in real life and could be beneficial for the relational triplet Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
