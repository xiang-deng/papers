Our vision paper outlines a plan to improve the future of semantic interoperability in data spaces through the application of machine learning. The use of data spaces, where data is exchanged among members in a self-regulated environment, is becoming increasingly popular. However, the current manual practices of managing metadata and vocabularies in these spaces are time-consuming, prone to errors, and may not meet the needs of all stakeholders.
