Fruit shape is an important biological trait that is also of special commercial value in tomato. The SUN gene has been known as a key regulator of tomato fruit elongation for years, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its transcriptional regulation remain little understood. Here, a unique BZR1-like transcription factor, BZR1. 7, was identified as a trans-acting factor of the SUN gene promoter that bound to the conserved E-box of the promoter to promoted SUN gene expression.
