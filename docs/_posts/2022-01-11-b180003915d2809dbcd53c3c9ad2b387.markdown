Aspect-level sentiment classification aims to integrating the context to predict the sentiment polarity of aspect-specific in a text, which has been quite useful and popular, eg opinion survey and products  recommending in ecommerce. Many recent studies exploit a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to perform aspect-level sentiment classification, but the limitation of long-term dependencies is not solved well, so that the semantic correlations between each two words of the text are Cites: Effective LSTMs for target-dependent sentiment classification
