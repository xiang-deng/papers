Graph clustering has been a hot research topic and is widely used in many fields, such as community detection in social networks. Lots of works combining auto-encoder and graph neural networks have been applied to clustering tasks by utilizing node attributes and graph structure. These works usually assumed the inherent parameters (ie size and variance) of different clusters in the latent embedding space are homogeneous, and hence the assigned probability is monotonous over the  Cites: Adaptive Graph Encoder for Attributed Graph Embedding
