Question generation over knowledge bases (KBQG) aims at generating natural questions about a subgraph, which can be answered by a given answer entity. Existing KBQG models still face two main challenges:(1) Most models often focus on the most relevant part of the answer entity, while neglecting the rest of the subgraph.(2) There are a large number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) predicates in real-world scenarios, which are hard to adapt for most KBQG models. To address these Cites: Fine-tuning can distort pretrained features and underperform out-of
