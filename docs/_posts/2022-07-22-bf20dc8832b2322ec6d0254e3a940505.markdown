As a fundamental task in natural language processing, relation extraction from unstructured text is usually processed with named entity recognition together. These models intend to extract entities and predict relations simultaneously. However, they typically focus on entity pairs representations or relation representations, which ignores the contextual semantic. To tackle these problems, we introduce a three-stage relational triple extraction model with relation-attentive contextual semantic  Cites: A General Framework for Information Extraction using Dynamic
