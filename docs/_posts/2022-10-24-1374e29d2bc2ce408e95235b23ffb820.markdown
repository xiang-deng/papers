We investigate the knowledge graph entity typing task which aims at inferring plausible entity types. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based Entity Typing (TET) approach, effectively encoding the content of neighbors of an entity. More precisely, TET is composed of three different mechanisms: a local transformer allowing to infer missing types of an entity by independently encoding the information provided by each of its neighbors; a global transformer aggregating the information …
