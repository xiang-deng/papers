In this paper, we propose document-level end-to-end sentiment analysis to efficiently understand aspect and review sentiment expressed in online reviews in a unified manner. In particular, we assume that star rating labels are a coarse-grained synthesis of aspect ratings across in the review. We propose a Distantly Supervised Pyramid Network (DSPN) to efficiently perform Aspect-Category Detection, Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis, and Rating Prediction using only document star rating  Cites: Document modeling with gated recurrent neural network for
