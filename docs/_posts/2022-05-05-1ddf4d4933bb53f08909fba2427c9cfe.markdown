Cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) is currently a hot research direction in the field of software reliability. Traditional CPDP methods cannot capture the semantic and contextual information of programs by handcrafted features, which affects the prediction performance. In this paper, we apply technology in the NLP domain to solve it. We first extract token vectors from the abstract syntax tree (AST) of source and target code files, and then convert them into numerical vectors by the word Cites: Detecting formal thought disorder by deep contextualized word
