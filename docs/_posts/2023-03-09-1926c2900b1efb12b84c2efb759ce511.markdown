At present, backdoor attacks attract attention as they do great harm to deep learning models. The adversary poisons the training data making the model being injected with a backdoor after being trained unconsciously by victims using the poisoned dataset. In the field of text, however, existing works do not provide sufficient defense against backdoor attacks. In this paper, we propose a Noise-augmented Contrastive Learning (NCL) framework to defend against textual backdoor attacks when training  Cites: Reformulating Unsupervised Style Transfer as Paraphrase
