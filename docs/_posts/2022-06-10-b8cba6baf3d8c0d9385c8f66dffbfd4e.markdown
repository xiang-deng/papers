With the advent of the 6G era, the concept of semantic communication has attracted increasing attention. Compared with conventional communication systems, semantic communication systems are not only affected by physical noise existing in the wireless communication environment, eg, additional white Gaussian noise, but also by semantic noise due to the source and the nature of deep learning-based systems. In this paper, we elaborate on the mechanism of semantic noise. In particular, we …
