Few-shot question answering (QA) aims at precisely discovering answers to a set of questions from context passages while only a few training samples are available. Although existing studies have made some progress and can usually achieve proper results, they suffer from understanding deep semantics for reasoning out the questions. In this paper, we develop Gotta, a Generative prOmpT-based daTa Augmentation framework to mitigate the challenge above.
