The assignment problem has many real-world applications such as allocations of agents and tasks for optimal utility gain. While it has been well-studied in the optimization literature when the underlying utility between every pair of agent and task is known, research is limited when the utilities are unknown and need to be learned from data on the fly. In this work, motivated by the mentor-mentee matching application in US universities, we develop an efficient sequential assignment  Cites: Provably optimal algorithms for generalized linear contextual bandits
