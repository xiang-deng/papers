End-to-end AutoML has attracted intensive interests from both academia and industry which automatically searches for ML pipelines in a space induced by feature engineering, algorithm/model selection, and hyper-parameter tuning. Existing AutoML systems, however, suffer from scalability issues when applying to application domains with large, high-dimensional search spaces. We present VolcanoML, a scalable and extensible framework that facilitates systematic exploration of large  Cites: AlphaD3M: Machine learning pipeline synthesis
