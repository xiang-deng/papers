Selective classification allows models to abstain from making predictions (eg, say I don t know ) when in doubt in order to obtain better effective accuracy. While typical selective models can be effective at producing more accurate predictions on average, they may still allow for wrong predictions that have high confidence, or skip correct predictions that have low confidence. Providing calibrated uncertainty estimates alongside predictions--probabilities that correspond to true frequencies  Cites: Randaugment: Practical automated data augmentation with a
