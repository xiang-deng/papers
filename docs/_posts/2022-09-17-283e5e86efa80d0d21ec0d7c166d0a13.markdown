Conversational recommender system (CRS) aims to model user preference through interactive conversations. Although there are some works, they still have two drawbacks:(1) they rely on large amounts of training data and suffer from data sparsity problem; and (2) they do not fully leverage different types of knowledge extracted from dialogues. To address these issues in CRS, we explore the intrinsic correlations of different types of knowledge by self-supervised learning, and propose  Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
