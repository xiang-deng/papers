An applied problem facing all areas of data science is harmonizing data sources. Joining data from multiple origins with unmapped and only partially overlapping features is a prerequisite to developing and testing robust, generalizable algorithms, especially in health care. We approach this issue in the common but difficult case of numeric features such as nearly Gaussian and binary features, where unit changes and variable shift make simple matching of univariate summaries unsuccessful.
