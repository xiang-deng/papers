Obtaining labelled data in a particular context could be expensive and time consuming. Although different algorithms, including unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, self-learning have been adopted, the performance of text classification varies with context. Given the lack of labelled dataset, we proposed a novel and simple unsupervised text classification model to classify cargo content in international shipping industry using the Standard International Trade Classification …
