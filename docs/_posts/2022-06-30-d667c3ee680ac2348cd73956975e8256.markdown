Abstract Machine learning especially deep learning methods have been widely used for runoff prediction in recent years. Models based on the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) framework were recently introduced into the field of rainfall-runoff modeling. In this paper, we demonstrate a new design of a seq2seq model which shows higher prediction accuracy than previous seq2seq models. Our new design takes advantage of the high linear correlation between historical runoff and future …
