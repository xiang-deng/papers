This work explores the utility of explicit structure for representation learning in NLP by developing StrAE--an autoencoding framework that faithfully leverages sentence structure to learn multi-level node embeddings in an unsupervised fashion. We use StrAE to train models across different types of sentential structure and objectives, including a novel contrastive loss over structure, and evaluate the learnt embeddings on a series of both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks. Our experiments indicate that Cites: Unsupervised parsing with S-DIORA: Single tree encoding for
