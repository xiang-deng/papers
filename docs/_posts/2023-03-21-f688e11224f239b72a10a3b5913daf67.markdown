Text retrieval using densesparse hybrids has been gaining popularity because of their effectiveness. Improvements to both sparse and dense models have also been noted, in the context of open-domain question answering. However, the increasing sophistication of proposed techniques places a growing strain on the reproducibility of results. Our work aims to tackle this challenge. In Generation Augmented Retrieval (GAR), a sequence-to-sequence model was used to generate candidate answer Cites: Neurips 2020 efficientqa competition: Systems, analyses and
