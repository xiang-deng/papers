In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on a bias measure, log-likelihood Masked Language Model (MLM) scoring, on a benchmark dataset. Previous work evaluates whether MLMs are biased or not for certain protected attributes (eg, race) by comparing the log-likelihood scores of sentences that contain stereotypical characteristics with one category (eg, black) versus another (eg, white). We hypothesized that this approach might be too sensitive to the choice of contextual  Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
