We introduce a conceptualisation for generating argumentation frameworks (AFs) from causal models for the purpose of forging explanations for models outputs. The conceptualisation is based on reinterpreting properties of semantics of AFs as explanation moulds, which are means for characterising argumentative relations. We demonstrate our methodology by reinterpreting the property of bi-variate reinforcement in bipolar AFs, showing how the extracted bipolar AFs may be used as  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
