Software vulnerabilities can pose severe harms to a computing system. They can lead to system crash, privacy leakage, or even physical damage. Correctly identifying vulnerabilities among enormous software codes in a timely manner is so far the essential prerequisite to patch them. Unfortantely, the current vulnerability identification methods, either the classic ones or the deep-learning-based ones, have several critical drawbacks, making them unable to meet the present-day  Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
