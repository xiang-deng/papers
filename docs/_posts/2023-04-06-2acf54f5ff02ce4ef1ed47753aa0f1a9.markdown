The continuous development of Question Answering (QA) datasets has drawn the research community s attention toward multi-domain models. A popular approach is to use multi-dataset models, which are models trained on multiple datasets to learn their regularities and prevent overfitting to a single dataset. However, with the proliferation of QA models in online repositories such as GitHub or Hugging Face, an alternative is becoming viable. Recent works have demonstrated that combining Cites: QA Dataset Explosion: A Taxonomy of NLP Resources for
