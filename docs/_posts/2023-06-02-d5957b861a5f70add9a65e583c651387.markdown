Intent discovery is the task of inferring latent intents from a set of unlabeled utterances, and is a useful step towards the efficient creation of new conversational agents. We show that recent competitive methods in intent discovery can be outperformed by clustering utterances based on abstractive summaries, ie, labels , that retain the core elements while removing non-essential information. We contribute the IDAS approach, which collects a set of descriptive utterance labels by  Cites: Learning To Retrieve Prompts for In-Context Learning
