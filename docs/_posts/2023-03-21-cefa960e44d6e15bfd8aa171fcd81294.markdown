In this research article the supervised adaptive approach for word sense disambiguation is discussed. The most critical and identified problem of natural language understanding is the lexical ambiguity. Lexical ambiguity is introduced by the polysemy words. This paper describes different state-of-the-art techniques to detect ambiguous words from the ambiguous sentence. The word embedding is an important phase of word sense disambiguation and which is succeeded by  Cites: An experimental study of graph connectivity for unsupervised word
