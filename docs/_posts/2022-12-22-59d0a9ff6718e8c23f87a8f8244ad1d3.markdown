Abstract Knowledgeenhanced shorttext matching has been a significant task attracting much attention in recent years. However, the existing approaches cannot effectively balance effect and efficiency. Effective models usually consist of complex network structures leading to slow inference speed and the difficulties of applications in actual practice. In addition, most knowledgeenhanced models try to link the mentions in the text to the entities of the knowledge graphsthe difficulties of entity  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
