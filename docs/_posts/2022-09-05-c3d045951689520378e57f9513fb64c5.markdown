Multi-hop question answering from knowledge bases (KBQA) is a hot research topic in natural language processing. Recently, graph neural network-based (GNN-based) methods have achieved promising results as the KB can be organized as a knowledge graph (KG). However, they often suffered from the sparsity of the KG which was detrimental to the structure-encoding and reasoning capabilities of GNN. Specifically, a KG is a sparse graph linked by directed relations and previous studies Cites: The web as a knowledge-base for answering complex questions
