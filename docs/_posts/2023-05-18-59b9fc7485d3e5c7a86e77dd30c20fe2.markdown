Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) is a classical approach to address lexical mismatch by enriching the query using first-pass retrieval. Moreover, recent work on generative-relevance feedback (GRF) shows that query expansion models using text generated from large language models can improve sparse retrieval without depending on first-pass retrieval effectiveness. This work extends GRF to dense and learned sparse retrieval paradigms with experiments over six standard document  Cites: Query Expansion Using Contextual Clue Sampling with Language
