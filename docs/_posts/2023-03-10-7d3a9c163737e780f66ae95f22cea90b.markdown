In recent years, leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques has become one of the main solutions to tackle many software engineering (SE) tasks, in research studies (ML4SE). This has been achieved by utilizing state-of-the-art models that tend to be more complex and black-box, such as deep learning, which is led to less explainable solutions. This lack of explainability reduces trust and uptake of ML4SE solutions by professionals in the industry. One potential remedy is to offer explainable AI (XAI) …
