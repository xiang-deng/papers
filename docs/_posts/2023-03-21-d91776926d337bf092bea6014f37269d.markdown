Attaining better sentence embeddings benefits a wide range of natural language processing tasks. SimCSE applied a simple contrastive learning framework to train BERT models and achieved excellent sentence embeddings. Based on SimCSE, this paper proposes Importance-aware contrastive learning via semantically augmented instances for Unsupervised Sentence Embeddings (IconUSE), further improving the performance of sentence embeddings. IconUSE includes three optimizations. Firstly Cites: SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings
