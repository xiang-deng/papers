Recent developments in the methods of explainable AI (xAI) methods allow us to explore the inner workings of deep neural networks (DNNs), revealing crucial information about input-output relationships and realizing how data connects with machine learning models. In this paper we explore interpretability of DNN models designed for identifying jets coming from top quark decay in the high energy proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We review a subset of existing …
