In the past few years, cross-modal image-text retrieval (ITR) has experienced increased interest in the research community due to its excellent research value and broad real-world application. It is designed for the scenarios where the queries are from one modality and the retrieval galleries from another modality. This paper presents a comprehensive and up-to-date survey on the ITR approaches from four perspectives. By dissecting an ITR system into two processes: feature extraction and Cites: Vinvl: Revisiting visual representations in vision-language models
