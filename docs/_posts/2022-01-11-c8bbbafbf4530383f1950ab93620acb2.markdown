PURPOSE: To examine the ability of 5 artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer vision algorithms, most trained to detect visible breast cancer on mammograms, to predict future risk relative to the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium clinical risk prediction model (BCSC v2). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this case-cohort study, women who had a screening mammogram in 2016 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California with no evidence of cancer on final imaging assessment were followed Cites: Evaluation of combined artificial intelligence and radiologist
