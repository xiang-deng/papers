This paper describes our system in the SemEval-2022 Task 12: linking mathematical symbols to their descriptions , achieving first on the leaderboard for all the subtasks comprising named entity extraction (NER) and relation extraction (RE). Our system is a two-stage pipeline model based on SciBERT that detects symbols, descriptions, and their relationships in scientific documents. The system consists of 1) machine reading comprehension (MRC)-based NER model, where each entity type is …
