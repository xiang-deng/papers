Efficiently identifying keyphrases that represent a given document is a challenging task. In the last years, plethora of keyword detection approaches were proposed. These approaches can be based on statistical (frequency-based) properties of eg, tokens, specialized neural language models, or a graph-based structure derived from a given document. The graph-based methods can be computationally amongst the most efficient ones, while maintaining the retrieval performance. One of the main Cites: Semeval 2017 task 10: Scienceie-extracting keyphrases and
