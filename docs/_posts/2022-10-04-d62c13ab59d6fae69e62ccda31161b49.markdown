AI chips play a vital role in real-time AI applications. AI chip design requires vast knowledge reuse in integrated circuits and neural networks, and this knowledge continues to grow at a rapid rate, leading to a heavy burden on designers. Automated methods are urgently needed to handle the massive and rapidly growing literature. In the realm of traditional EDA, deep learning can produce excellent designs by learning from a large number of design examples. However, in front-end  Cites: Chip placement with deep reinforcement learning
