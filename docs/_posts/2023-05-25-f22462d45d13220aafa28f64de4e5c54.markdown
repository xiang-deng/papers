Prompt learning is an effective paradigm that bridges gaps between the pre-training tasks and the corresponding downstream applications. Approaches based on this paradigm have achieved great transcendent results in various applications. However, it still needs to be answered how to design a general-purpose framework based on the prompt learning paradigm for various information extraction tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel composable prompt-based generative framework …
