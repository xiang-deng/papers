Abstract Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become an integral part of AI as it enables knowledge construction and exploring missing information. KGE encodes the entities and relations (elements) in a knowledge graph into a low-dimensional vector space. The conventional KGE models are trained using positive and negative examples by discriminating the positives from the negatives. However, the existing knowledge graphs contain only the positives. Hence, it is required to generate Cites: Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text
