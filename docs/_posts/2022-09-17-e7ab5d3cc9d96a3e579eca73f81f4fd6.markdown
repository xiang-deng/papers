Representing the structural relations between entities, ie, knowledge graph embedding, which is a method to learn low-dimensional representations of knowledge, has become an increasingly prevalent research orientation in cognitive and human intelligence. It is significant to study how to interrelate, fuse and embed the knowledge graph data from different domains while considering data not shared. In this paper, we propose a model of cross-domain knowledge graph embedding in  Cites: Observed Versus Latent Features for Knowledge Base and Text
