Document-level relation extraction (Doc-level RE) is a more practical and challenging task, which provides a new perspective on obtaining factual knowledge from the more complex cross-sentence text. Recent Doc-level RE, based on pre-trained language models, uses graph neural networks to implicitly model relation reasoning in a document. However, it is not perfect that the model neglects explicit reasoning clues, leading to a weak ability and a lack of capability to model long Cites: Coreferential reasoning learning for language representation
