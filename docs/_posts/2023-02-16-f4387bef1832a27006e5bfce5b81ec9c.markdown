We present a comprehensive study involving three different types of machine learning (unsupervised, supervised, and an emphasis on semisupervised) for bedrock-lithology classification using a publicly available dataset from New South Wales, Australia. The goal of this work is to demonstrate (1) the value each different type of machine learning can provide and (2) which machine learning type (s) may be preferable under different circumstances. Training data are characteristically …
