Long-form answers, consisting of multiple sentences, can provide nuanced and comprehensive answers to a broader set of questions.

Our main goal is to understand how humans organize information to craft complex answers. We develop an ontology of six sentence-level functional roles for long-form Cites: KILT: a benchmark for knowledge intensive language tasks
