Merging structured knowledge has been widely investigated to build common resources in recent years. Indeed, many merging operators have been proposed and developed. However, the majority of them lack comparison and evaluation. Finding ontology sources for evaluation is not an effortless task. To this end, we propose a framework for evaluating the quality of ontology merging operators. The primary strategy starts with an original ontology as a gold standard to create noisy ontologies  Cites: Discovering subsumption relationships for web-based ontologies
