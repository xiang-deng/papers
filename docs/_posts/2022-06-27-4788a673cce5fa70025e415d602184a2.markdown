Due to the interaction of many factors in the stock market, stock price prediction has always been a challenging problem in the field of machine learning. In particular, the mutation factors of the stock market often have a great impact on subsequent predictions. The existing prediction models seldom consider the impacts of other stocks in the stock market and mutation points on the prediction accuracy of target stocks. Therefore, this paper presents a new knowledge graph and deep learning
