With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years and the subsequent increase in complexity of the applied models, the growing demand in computational resources is starting to pose a significant challenge. The need for higher compute power is being met with increasingly more potent accelerator hardware as well as the use of large and powerful compute clusters. However, the gain in prediction accuracy from large models trained on distributed and accelerated systems ultimately comes at the  Cites: Green AI
