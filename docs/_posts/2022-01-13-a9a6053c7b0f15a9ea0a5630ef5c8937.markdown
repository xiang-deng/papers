Multi-label image recognition has been an indispensable fundamental component for many real computer vision applications. However, a severe threat of privacy leakage in multi-label image recognition has been overlooked by existing studies. To fill this gap, two privacy-preserving models, Privacy-Preserving Multi-label Graph Convolutional Networks (P2-ML-GCN) and Robust P2-ML-GCN (RP2-ML-GCN), are developed in this article, where differential privacy mechanism is implemented on the Cites: Glove: Global vectors for word representation
