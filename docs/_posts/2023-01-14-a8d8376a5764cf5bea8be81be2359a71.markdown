This paper presents DAGOBAH SL 2022, a semantic table interpretation system that has been continuously improved over the last four years when participating in the SemTab challenge. This year, we have improved the lookup coverage using external resources and we have integrated language models for better understanding the table headers. We have also implemented various system optimizations that lead to a reduction in execution time of about 30%. In this paper, we also show the  Cites: TaBERT: Pretraining for joint understanding of textual and tabular
