Topic segmentation is important in understanding scientific documents since it can not only provide better readability but also facilitate downstream tasks such as information retrieval and question answering by creating appropriate sections or paragraphs. In the topic segmentation task, topic coherence is critical in predicting segmentation boundaries. Most of the existing models have tried to exploit as many contexts as possible to extract useful topic-related information.
