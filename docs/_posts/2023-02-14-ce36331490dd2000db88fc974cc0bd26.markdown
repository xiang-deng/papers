In the last 5 years, language representation models, such as BERT and GPT3, based on transformer neural networks, have led to enormous progress in natural language processing (NLP). One such NLP task is commonsense reasoning, where performance is usually evaluated through multiplechoice question answering benchmarks. Till date, many such benchmarks have been proposed, and leaderboards tracking stateoftheart performance on those benchmarks suggest  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
