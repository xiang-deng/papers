In the last 5 years, language representation models, such as BERT and GPT‐3, based on transformer neural networks, have led to enormous progress in natural language processing (NLP). One such NLP task is commonsense reasoning, where performance is usually evaluated through multiple‐choice question answering benchmarks. Till date, many such benchmarks have been proposed, and  leaderboards  tracking state‐of‐the‐art performance on those benchmarks suggest …
