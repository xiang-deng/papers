We consider the task of self-supervised representation learning (SSL) for tabular data: tabular-SSL. Typical contrastive learning based SSL methods require instance-wise data augmentations which are difficult to design for unstructured tabular data. Existing tabular-SSL methods design such augmentations in a relatively ad-hoc fashion and can fail to capture the underlying data manifold. Instead of augmentations based approaches for tabular-SSL, we propose a new reconstruction
