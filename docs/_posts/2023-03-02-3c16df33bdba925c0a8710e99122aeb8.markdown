This paper studies the prediction of a target $\mathbf {z} $ from a pair of random variables $(\mathbf {x},\mathbf {y}) $, where the ground-truth predictor is additive $\mathbb {E}[\mathbf {z}\mid\mathbf {x},\mathbf {y}]= f_\star (\mathbf {x})+ g_ {\star}(\mathbf {y}) $. We study the performance of empirical risk minimization (ERM) over functions $ f+ g $, $ f\in\mathcal {F} $ and $ g\in\mathcal {G} $, fit on a given training distribution, but evaluated on a test distribution which exhibits covariate shift Cites: Accuracy on the line: on the strong correlation between out-of
