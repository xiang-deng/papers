Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) belonging to porous 2-or 3-dimensional materials have shown promising potential with wide use in different multidisciplinary fields because they possess remarkable structural properties which confer on them tunable functionalities coupled with excellent morphologies and topologies. Different syntheses approaches have been designed and developed for the preparation of various MOF derivatives. However, unique solvents such as deep eutectic solvents …
