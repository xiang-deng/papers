Semi-supervised learning is an effective method to study how to use both labeled data and unlabeled data to improve the performance of the classifier, which has become the hot field of machine learning in recent years. Graph-based semi-supervised learning is very promising among these Semi-supervised methods for its good performance and universality, it represents all the data as a graph and the label information is propagated from the labeled data to the unlabeled data along with the  Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
