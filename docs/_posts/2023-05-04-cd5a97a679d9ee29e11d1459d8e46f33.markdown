Due to the lack of temporal annotation, current Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) methods are generally stuck into over-complete or incomplete localization. In this paper, we aim to leverage the text information to boost WTAL from two aspects, ie,(a) the discriminative objective to enlarge the inter-class difference, thus reducing the over-complete;(b) the generative objective to enhance the intra-class integrity, thus finding more complete temporal boundaries. For the …
