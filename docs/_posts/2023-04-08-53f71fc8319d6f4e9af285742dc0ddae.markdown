Recent advances in deep learning have made learning representation from ever-growing datasets possible in the domain of vision, natural language processing (NLP), and robotics, among others. However, deep networks are notoriously data-hungry; for example, training language models with attention mechanisms sometimes requires trillions of parameters and tokens. In contrast, we can often access a limited number of samples in many tasks. It is crucial to learn models from …
