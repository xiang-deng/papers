Camera-based contactless photoplethysmography refers to a set of popular techniques for contactless physiological measurement. The current state-of-the-art neural models are typically trained in a supervised manner using videos accompanied by gold standard physiological measurements. However, they often generalize poorly out-of-domain examples (ie, videos that are unlike those in the training set). Personalizing models can help improve model generalizability, but Cites: Generalized inner loop meta-learning
