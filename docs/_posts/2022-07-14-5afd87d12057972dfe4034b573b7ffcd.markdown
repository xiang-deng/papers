This work proposes the adoption of deep pre-trained models to generate neologisms, approaching the word generation problem as a supervised summarization task in which we provide the definition of the topic as input and expect a new summarized word as output. We explore subword (T5) and character-level (ByT5) models for this task, fine-tuning them with two different datasets and assessing the quality of the outcomes. We demonstrate the success of the proposals …
