Real-world economies can be modeled as a network with many heterogeneous and strategic agents. In this setting, it is very challenging to find optimal mechanisms, eg, taxes, 1) when taking strategic best responses into account and 2) even when using restrictive assumptions, eg, that supply always meets demand. Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a natural framework to learn mechanisms and model strategic best responses, but independent MARL often collapses to trivial …
