The ability to generate rules and hypotheses plays a key role in multiple aspects of human cognition including concept learning and explanation. Previous research has framed this ability as a form of inference via probabilistic program induction. However, this approach requires careful construction of the right grammar and hypothesis space for a particular task. In this work, we propose an alternative computational account of rule generation and concept learning that sidesteps some … Cites: ‪Shaping visual representations with language for few-shot …‬
