As a typical label-limited task, it is significant and valuable to explore networks that enable to utilize labeled and unlabeled samples simultaneously for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image scene classification. Graph convolutional network (GCN) is a powerful semisupervised learning paradigm that helps to capture the topological relationships of scenes in SAR images. While the performance is not satisfactory when existing GCNs are directly used for SAR image scene classification with limited … Cites: ‪Semi-supervised Learning on Directed Graphs.‬
