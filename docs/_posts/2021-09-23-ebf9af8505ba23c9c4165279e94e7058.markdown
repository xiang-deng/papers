Abstract Knowledge graphs (KGs) store real-world information in the form of graphs consisting of relationships between entities and have been widely used in the Semantic Web community since it is readable by machines. However, most KGs are known to be very incomplete. The issues of structure sparseness and noise paths in large-scale KGs create a substantial barrier to representation learning. In this paper, we propose an Attribute-embodied neural Relation Path Prediction (ARPP) model to Cites: Compositional Learning of Embeddings for Relation Paths in
