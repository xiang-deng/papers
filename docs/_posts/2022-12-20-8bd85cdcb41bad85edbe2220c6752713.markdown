Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing converts a natural language sentence into a specially designed semantic graph (AMR), which captures the most essential semantic entities and relations of the input sentence. While the recent introduction of pretrained sequence-to-sequence models have brought performance improvement and pipeline simplification, the problem of how to best encode structural information into seq2seq models remains. This exploratory work proposes joint training of …
