Abstract Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has been applied to a wide variety of applications. In parallel, network-based modeling has highlighted the importance of Markov chains and other random-walk models for analyzing the structural patterns through centrality analysis, community detection, and geometric embedding. In particular, Google s PageRank algorithm has revolutionized web-search and many other applications involving social, biological, and technological networks.
