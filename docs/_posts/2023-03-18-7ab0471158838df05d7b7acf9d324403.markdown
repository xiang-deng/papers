The ability to learn continually is essential in a complex and changing world. In this paper, we characterize the behavior of canonical value-based deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches under varying degrees of non-stationarity. In particular, we demonstrate that deep RL agents lose their ability to learn good policies when they cycle through a sequence of Atari 2600 games. This phenomenon is alluded to in prior work under various guises--eg, loss of plasticity, implicit under …
