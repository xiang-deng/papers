1. Summary Large Language Models (LLMs), such asGPT-4, an advanced Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), is capable of processing multiple types of input and output, such as text and images, and has demonstrated close to human-layer performance in various professional and academic evaluations. However, the current application evaluation of GPT-4 still lacks an effective evaluation system and standard system, resulting in the inability to fully reflect its capabilities and limitations  Cites: Sparks of artificial general intelligence: Early experiments with gpt-4
