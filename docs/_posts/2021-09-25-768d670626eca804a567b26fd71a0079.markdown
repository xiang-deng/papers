Deep learning approaches have achieved great success in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, deep neural models often suffer from overfitting and data scarcity problems that are pervasive in NLP tasks. In recent years, Multi-Task Learning (MTL), which can leverage useful information of related tasks to achieve simultaneous performance improvement on multiple related tasks, has been used to handle these problems. In this paper, we give an overview of the Cites: Multi-task learning for conversational question answering over a
