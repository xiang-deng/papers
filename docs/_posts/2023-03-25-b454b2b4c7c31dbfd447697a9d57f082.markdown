The analysis and inference of program play an important role in software development, maintenance and migration. How to efficiently obtain high quality information from program code has become a hot research topic. In recent years, deep learning-based representation learning technology has achieved good results in the natural language processing domain. A large number of researchers have introduced the representation learning technology into the code analysis domain of  Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
