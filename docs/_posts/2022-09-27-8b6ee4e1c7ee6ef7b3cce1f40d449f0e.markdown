We study the problem of explainability-first clustering where explainability becomes a first-class citizen for clustering. Previous clustering approaches use decision trees for explanation, but only after the clustering is completed. In contrast, our approach is to perform clustering and decision tree training holistically where the decision tree s performance and size also influence the clustering results. We assume the attributes for clustering and explaining are distinct, although this is not necessary. We observe …
