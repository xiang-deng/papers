Partial label learning (PLL) is an emerging framework in weakly supervised machine learning with broad application prospects. It handles the case in which each training example corresponds to a candidate label set and only one label concealed in the set is the ground-truth label. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy framework for PLL including four categories: disambiguation strategy, transformation strategy, theory-oriented strategy and extensions. We analyze and evaluate methods in each  Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
