Reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively researched for enhancing human-environment interactions in various human-centric tasks, including e-learning and healthcare. Since deploying and evaluating policies online are high-stakes in such tasks, off-policy evaluation (OPE) is crucial for inducing effective policies. In human-centric environments, however, OPE is challenging because the underlying state is often unobservable, while only aggregate rewards can be observed (students test Cites: Breaking the curse of horizon: Infinite-horizon off-policy estimation
