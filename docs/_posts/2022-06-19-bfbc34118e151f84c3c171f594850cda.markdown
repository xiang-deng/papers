Open-Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) assumes that a target domain contains unknown classes, which are not discovered in a source domain. Existing domain adversarial learning methods are not suitable for OSDA because distribution matching with\textit {unknown} classes leads to the negative transfer. Previous OSDA methods have focused on matching the source and the target distribution by only utilizing\textit {known} classes. However, this\textit {known}-only matching may fail to …
