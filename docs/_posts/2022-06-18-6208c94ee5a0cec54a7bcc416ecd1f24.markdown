Current architectures for multi-modality tasks such as visual question answering suffer from their high complexity. As a result, these architectures are difficult to train and require high computational resources. To address these problems we present a CLIP-based architecture that does not require any fine-tuning of the feature extractors. A simple linear classifier is used on the concatenated features of the image and text encoder. During training an auxiliary loss is added which operates on …
