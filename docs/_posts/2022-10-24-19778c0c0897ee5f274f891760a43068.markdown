Fault localization has been used to provide feedback for incorrect student programs since locations of faults can be a valuable hint for students about what caused their programs to crash. Unfortunately, existing fault localization techniques for student programs are limited because they usually consider either the program s syntax or semantics alone. This motivates the new design of fault localization techniques that use both semantic and syntactical information of the program.
