Abstract In recent years, Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches with enhanced knowledge graphs (KG) perform well in question answering (QA) tasks. One critical challenge is how to effectively utilize interactions between the QA context and KG. However, existing work only adopts the identical QA context representation to interact with multiple layers of KG, which results in a restricted interaction. In this paper, we propose DRLK (Dynamic Hierarchical Reasoning with Language Model Cites: Greaselm: Graph reasoning enhanced language models for
