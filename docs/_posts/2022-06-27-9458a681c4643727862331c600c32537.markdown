Neural backdoors represent one primary threat to the security of deep learning systems. The intensive research has produced a plethora of backdoor attacks/defenses, resulting in a constant arms race. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks, many critical questions remain under-explored:(i) what are the strengths and limitations of different attacks/defenses?(ii) what are the best practices to operate them? and (iii) how can the existing attacks/defenses be further
