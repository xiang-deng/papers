Abstract Evaluation of the narrative text generated by machines has traditionally been a challenge, particularly when attempting to evaluate subjective elements such as interest or believability. Recent improvements in narrative machine text generation have been largely driven by the emergence of transformerbased language models, trained on massive quantities of data, resulting in higher quality text generation. In this study, a corpus of stories is generated using the pretrained Cites: STORIUM: A Dataset and Evaluation Platform for Machine-in-the
