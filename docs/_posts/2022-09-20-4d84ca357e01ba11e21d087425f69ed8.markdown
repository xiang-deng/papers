With the development of data science, more and more machine learning technologies have been designed to solve complicated and challenging real-world tasks containing a large volume of data. And many significant real-world datasets contain data in the form of networks or graphs. Graph Neural Networks is one of the powerful machine learning tools, which could provide a perfect solution to processing a large amount of non-Euclidean data. And because most bio information …
