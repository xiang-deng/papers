Abstract The Cancer Registry of Norway organises a population-based breast cancer screening program, where 250 000 women participate each year. The interpretation of the screening mammograms is a manual process, but deep neural networks are showing potential in mammographic screening. Most methods focus on methods trained from pixel-level annotations, but these require expertise and are time- consuming to produce. Through the screenings, image level annotations are Cites: An interpretable classifier for high-resolution breast cancer
