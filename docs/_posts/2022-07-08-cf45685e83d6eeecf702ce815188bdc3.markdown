Explanations for\emph {black-box} models help us understand model decisions as well as provide information on model biases and inconsistencies. Most of the current explainability techniques provide a single level of explanation, often in terms of feature importance scores or feature attention maps in input space. Our focus is on explaining deep discriminative models at\emph {multiple levels of abstraction}, from fine-grained to fully abstract explanations. We achieve this by using the natural Cites: Learning by abstraction: The neural state machine
