Researchers use datasets of Question-Solution pairs to train machine learning models, such as source code generation models. A Question-Solution pair contains two parts: a programming question and its corresponding Solution Snippet. A Solution Snippet is a source code that solves a programming question. These datasets of Question-Solution pairs can be extracted from a number of different platforms. In this research, I study how Question-Solution pairs are extracted from Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
