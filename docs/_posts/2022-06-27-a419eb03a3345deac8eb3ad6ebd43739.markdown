One way of science-guided machine learning is to directly couple mechanistic modeling with machine learning approaches within a differentiable programming approach, leading to a so-called hybrid modeling approach. For instance, well-established theoretical knowledge can be formulated as explicit equations, while parameters, which cannot be derived from first principles, or space-time-varying (latent) states, are estimated via a machine learning approach. Such hybrid modeling Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
