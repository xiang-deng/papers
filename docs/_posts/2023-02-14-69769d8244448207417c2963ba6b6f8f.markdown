We introduce a regression-based framework to explore the dependence that global features have on score predictions from pretrained transformer-based language models used for Automated Essay Scoring (AES). We demonstrate that neural networks use approximations of rubric-relevant global features to determine a score prediction. By considering linear models on the hidden states, we can approximate global features and measure their importance to score predictions. This study uses …
