Text style transfer is an exciting task within the field of natural language generation that is often plagued by the need for high-quality paired datasets. Furthermore, training a model for multi-attribute text style transfer requires datasets with sufficient support across all combinations of the considered stylistic attributes, adding to the challenges of training a style transfer model. This paper explores the impact of training data input diversity on the quality of the generated text from the multi-style  Cites: Reformulating Unsupervised Style Transfer as Paraphrase
