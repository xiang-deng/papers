In few-shot text classification, the lack of significant features limits models from generalizing to data not included in the training set. Data augmentation is a solution to the classification tasks; however, the standard augmentation methods in natural language processing are not feasible in few-shot learning. In this study, we explore data augmentation in few-shot text classification. We propose saliency-equivalent concatenation (SEC) 1 1 Our code is available at https://github. com/IKMLab/SEC Cites: Strata: Self-training with task augmentation for better few-shot
