Normalizing flows model complex probability distributions using maps obtained by composing invertible layers. Special linear layers such as masked and 1 {\texttimes} 1 convolutions play a key role in existing architectures because they increase expressive power while having tractable Jacobians and inverses. We propose a new family of invertible linear layers based on butterfly layers, which are known to theoretically capture complex linear structures including permutations and  Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
