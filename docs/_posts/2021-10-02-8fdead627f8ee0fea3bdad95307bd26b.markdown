Entity linking (EL) is the process of linking entity mentions appearing in web text with their corresponding entities in a knowledge base. EL plays an important role in the fields of knowledge engineering and data mining, underlying a variety of downstream applications such as knowledge base population, content analysis, relation extraction, and question answering. In recent years, deep learning (DL), which has achieved tremendous success in various domains, has also been Cites: Modeling mention, context and entity with neural networks for entity
