However, current autoregressive approaches suffer from high latency. In this paper, we focus on non-autoregressive translation (NAT) for this problem for its efficiency advantage. We identify that current constrained NAT models, which are based on iterative editing, do not handle low-frequency constraints well. To this end, we propose a plug-in algorithm for this line of work, ie, Aligned Constrained Training (ACT), which alleviates this problem by familiarizing the model with the source-side Cites: Latent-variable non-autoregressive neural machine translation
