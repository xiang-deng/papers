Graph is a ubiquitous structure in natural language processing (NLP), which describes a collection of entities, represented as nodes, and their pairwise relationships, represented as edges. Many sentence-level meaning representations employ directed, acyclic graphs as the underlying formalism, while most tree-based syntactic representations can also be regarded as graphs. In this thesis, we mainly focus on predicting graphs from texts, and integrating graphs for downstream tasks Cites: Cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction with graph lstms
