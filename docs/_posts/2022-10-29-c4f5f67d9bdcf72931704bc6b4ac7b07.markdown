We survey a current, heated debate in the AI research community on whether large pre-trained language models can be said to understand language--and the physical and social situations language encodes--in any important sense. We describe arguments that have been made for and against such understanding, and key questions for the broader sciences of intelligence that have arisen in light of these arguments. We contend that a new science of intelligence can be developed  Cites: Competency Problems: On Finding and Removing Artifacts in
