Although data-free incremental learning methods are memory-friendly, accurately estimating and counteracting representation shifts is challenging in the absence of historical data. This paper addresses this thorny problem by proposing a novel incremental learning method inspired by human analogy capabilities. Specifically, we design an analogy-making mechanism to remap the new data into the old class by prompt tuning. It mimics the feature distribution of the target old class on the old …
