Question Answering (QA) systems play an important role in today s humancomputer interaction systems. QA performance can be significantly improved using effective answer passage retrieval and ranking techniques. Our focus in this paper is on both non machine learning-based and deep learning-based passage retrieval and ranking systems for QA to leverage linguistic features within the text of questions and passages and improve passage ranking effectiveness. We propose a decoupled Cites: Efficient passage retrieval with hashing for open-domain question
