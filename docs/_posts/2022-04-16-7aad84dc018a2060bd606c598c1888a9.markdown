In a task-oriented dialogue system, Dialogue State Tracking (DST) keeps track of all important information by filling slots with values given through the conversation. Existing methods generally rely on a predefined set of values and struggle to generalise to previously unseen slots in new domains. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain and multi-lingual dialogue state tracker in a neural reading comprehension approach. Our approach fills the slot values using span prediction Cites: A simple language model for task-oriented dialogue
