Modern datacenters host a wide range of applications. Managing application performance is critical for the overall cost efficiency of datacenter infrastructures. However, previous solutions struggle to address the unique challenges presented in datacenters and cannot achieve robust and efficient management for datacenter-scale computing. In this thesis, I will focus on representative data center management problems and address these challenges utilizing practical machine  Cites: On the Number of Linear Regions of Deep Neural Networks
