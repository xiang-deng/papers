The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enabled large-scale AI applications to land in the market and practice. However, while AI technology has brought many conveniences to people in the productization process, it has also exposed many security issues. Especially, attacks against online learning vulnerabilities of chatbots occur frequently. Therefore, this paper proposes a semantics censorship chatbot system based on reinforcement learning, which is Cites: Detecting formal thought disorder by deep contextualized word
