User Behavior Modeling (UBM) plays a critical role in user interest learning, which has been extensively used in recommender systems. Crucial interactive patterns between users and items have been exploited, which brings compelling improvements in many recommendation tasks. In this paper, we attempt to provide a thorough survey of this research topic. We start by reviewing the research background of UBM. Then, we provide a systematic taxonomy of existing UBM Cites: Ask me anything: Dynamic memory networks for natural language
