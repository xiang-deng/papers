Entity matching (EM) identifies tuples from different data sources that refer to the same real-world entity. One of the main challenges of EM is attribute heterogeneity, that is, there are many different types of attributes in an entity. Present researches focus on using rules or neural networks to select similarity measures for different types of attributes. However, they select only one specific similarity measure for each attribute but ignore matching information from many other aspects. In addition Cites: Principles of data integration
