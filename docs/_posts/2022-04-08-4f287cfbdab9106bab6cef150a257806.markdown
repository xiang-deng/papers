This paper proposes a method for improved CTC inference with searched intermediates and multi-pass conditioning. The paper first formulates self- conditioned CTC as a probabilistic model with an intermediate prediction as a latent representation and provides a tractable conditioning framework. We then propose two new conditioning methods based on the new formulation:(1) Searched intermediate conditioning that refines intermediate predictions with beam-search,(2) Cites: Latent-variable non-autoregressive neural machine translation
