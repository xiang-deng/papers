Event extraction (EE) is a fundamental information extraction task that aims to identify structured events, including event types, triggers and arguments, from unstructured texts. The overlapping EE, in which a trigger may be assigned to multiple event types, or an argument owns more than one role, is a more challenging task. Existing methods deconstruct the task in a pipeline-based cascade decoding paradigm, sequentially extracting overlapping event elements (triggers and arguments) based Cites: Entity, relation, and event extraction with contextualized span
