Detecting anomaly plays a vital role in ensuring the reliability and safety of many applications. However, this task is challenging due to the unclear correlation underneath the testing data and the class imbalanced issue between anomalous and normal data. Moreover, it is noted that the misclassification of anomalous and normal data is usually associated with different costs in real applications. To solve these issues, we propose a search-based cost-sensitive hypergraph learning  Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
