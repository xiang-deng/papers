Deep learning algorithms have seen a massive rise in popularity for remote sensing over the past few years. Recently, studies on applying deep learning techniques to graph data in remote sensing (eg, public transport networks) have been conducted. In graph node classification tasks, traditional graph neural network (GNN) models assume that different types of misclassifications have an equal loss and thus seek to maximize the posterior probability of the sample nodes under labeled classes.
