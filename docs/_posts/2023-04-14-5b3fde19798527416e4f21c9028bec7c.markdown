Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a classical algorithmic problem that is increasingly relevant in practice today across a variety of AI application domains. For AI-first applications, ANNS is the key index that connects neural networks for search [27], recommendation [6] and content generation/summarization [10, 18, 19, 25, 26] with relevant items in the knowledge store. This linking process helps better ground the output of the models and generates higher quality results. While ANNS is  Cites: Few-shot learning with retrieval augmented language models
