Load Forecasting helps the utility to make important decision such as load scheduling, load shedding, etc. The main objective of load forecasting are control, operation and planning of power system. With increasing complexity of power system, the proper choice of machine learning techniques also becomes challenging. This paper presents a comparative analysis of nineteen machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Bagged Tree, Cubic Support Vector …
