In explainable AI there is usually a trade-off between the fidelity and the complexity of the explanation. In exemplar-based explanation systems, this complexity can be measured by the number or size of the examples needed for the human to grasp a concept that has sufficient fidelity with the AI system to be explained. In this paper we analyse a concept class of Boolean functions that is learned by AI systems (CNN) as bitmaps of possibly rotated and resized letters. We assume the human learner …
