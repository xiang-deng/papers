How we choose to represent our data has a fundamental impact on our ability to subsequently extract information from them. Machine learning promises to automatically determine efficient representations from large unstructured datasets, such as those arising in biology. However, empirical evidence suggests that seemingly minor changes to these machine learning models yield drastically different data representations that result in different biological interpretations of data Cites: Structure-based protein function prediction using graph
