High-feature dimensions is one of the obvious challenges facing large-scale hierarchical classification problem. One promising way to overcome such problem is reducing the features size by removing irrelevant, noise and redundant features. Filter-based feature selection methods are commonly used to construct smaller subset of most relevant features in either adaptive or global approach at each non leaf node within the hierarchy. Both the Feature selection approaches do not only Cites: Hierarchical classification via orthogonal transfer
