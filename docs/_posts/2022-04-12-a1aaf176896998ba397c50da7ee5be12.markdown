A long-standing goal of Machine Learning (ML) and AI at large is to design autonomous agents able to efficiently interact with our world. Towards this, taking inspirations from the interactive nature of human and animal learning, several lines of works focused on building decision making agents embodied in real or virtual environments. In less than a decade, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) established itself as one of the most powerful set of techniques to train such Cites: Experience grounds language
