Preterm infants spontaneous movements monitoring is a valuable ally to early recognise neuro-motor impairments, especially common in infants born before term. Currently, highly-specialized clinicians assess the movements quality on the basis of subjective, discontinuous, and time-consuming observations. To support clinicians, automatic monitoring systems have been developed, among which Deep Learning algorithms (mainly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)) are up-to-date the most Cites: Green AI
