Facilitating the interactions between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in automated systems is becoming central with the advancements in technology and their more widespread adoption in practical applications. Mathematical programming scheduling techniques are a driving factor to assist ground station operators both on board the satellite, for autonomous decision making, and on ground, for supporting mid-term operations scheduling. When communication to ground is limited …
