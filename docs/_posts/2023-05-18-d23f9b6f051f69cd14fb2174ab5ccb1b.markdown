As information retrieval researchers, we not only develop algorithmic solutions to hard problems, but we also insist on a proper, multifaceted evaluation of ideas. The literature on the fundamental topic of retrieval and ranking, for instance, has a rich history of studying the effectiveness of indexes, retrieval algorithms, and complex machine learning rankers, while at the same time quantifying their computational costs, from creation and training to application and inference. This is evidenced, for  Cites: Multi-stage document ranking with BERT
