The sensor-based recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in smart-home environments is an active research area, with relevant applications in healthcare and ambient assisted living. The application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to ADLs recognition has the potential of making this process trusted, transparent and understandable. The few works that investigated this problem considered only interpretable machine learning models. In this work, we propose DeXAR, a novel Cites: Does the Whole Exceed its Parts? The Effect of AI Explanations on
