Generative neural models hold great promise in enhancing programming education by synthesizing new content for students. We seek to design neural models that can automatically generate programming tasks for a given specification in the context of visual programming domains. Despite the recent successes of large generative models like GPT-4, our initial results show that these models are ineffective in synthesizing visual programming tasks and struggle with logical and spatial Cites: Sparks of artificial general intelligence: Early experiments with gpt-4
