Abstract Recently, Probabilistic Circuits such as Sum-Product Networks have received growing attention, as they can represent complex features but still provide tractable inference. Although quite successful, unfortunately, they lack the capability of handling control structures, such as for and while loops. In this work, we introduce Sum-Product Loop Language (SPLL), a novel programming language that is capable of tractable inference on complex probabilistic code that includes loops … Cites: ‪End-to-end differentiable proving‬
