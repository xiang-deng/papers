Objectives Federated learning (FL) allows multiple institutions to collaboratively develop a machine learning algorithm without sharing their data. Organizations instead share model parameters only, allowing them to benefit from a model built with a larger dataset while maintaining the privacy of their own data. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the current state of FL in healthcare and discuss the limitations and promise of this technology. Methods We conducted a literature search … Cites: ‪Deep learning-enabled medical computer vision‬
