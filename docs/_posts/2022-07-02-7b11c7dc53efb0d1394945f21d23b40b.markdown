Multi-label aspect category detection allows a given review sentence to contain multiple aspect categories, which is shown to be more practical in sentiment analysis and attracting increasing attention. As annotating large amounts of data is time-consuming and labor-intensive, data scarcity occurs frequently in real-world scenarios, which motivates multi-label few-shot aspect category detection. However, research on this problem is still in infancy and few methods are available. In this
