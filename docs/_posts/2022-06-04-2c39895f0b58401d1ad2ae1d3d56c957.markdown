Data sources for medical image segmentation can be quite extensive, and models trained with data from a source domain may perform poorly on data from the target domain owing to domain shift issues. To overcome the impact of domain shift, we propose a novel meta-learning-based multi-source domain adaptation framework for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we designed a domain discriminator module to produce category prediction over the latent features, and an image … Cites: ‪Multi-Source Domain Adaptation for Text Classification via …‬
