Retrieving relevant images from a catalog based on a query image together with a modifying caption is a challenging multimodal task that can particularly benefit domains like apparel shopping, where fine details and subtle variations may be best expressed through natural language. We introduce a new evaluation dataset, Challenging Fashion Queries (CFQ), as well as a modeling approach that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the existing Fashion IQ (FIQ) dataset.
