Text adversarial attack is an effective strategy to investigate the vulnerability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Most of text attack studies focus on word-level attacks with static or dynamic optimization algorithms. However, they are hard to balance (1) attack performance (ie, attack success rate, word substitution rate) and (2) attack efficiency. Generally, static optimization is fast but suffers from low attack performance, and the dynamic adversary improves the attacking quality but is …
