Event argument extraction (EAE) is an important information extraction task, which aims to identify the arguments of an event described in a given text and classify the roles played by them. A key characteristic in realistic EAE data is that the instance numbers of different roles follow an obvious long-tail distribution. However, the training and evaluation paradigms of existing EAE models either prone to neglect the performance on tail roles , or change the role instance distribution for model training Cites: Natural language to structured query generation via meta-learning
