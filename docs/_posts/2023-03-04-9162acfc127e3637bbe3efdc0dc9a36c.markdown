Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) have led to significant improvement in natural language interfaces for structured databases (NL2SQL). Despite the great strides, the overall accuracy of NL2SQL models is still far from being perfect ( 75% on the Spider benchmark). In practice, this requires users to discern incorrect SQL queries generated by a model and manually fix them when using NL2SQL models. Currently, there is a lack of  Cites: Representing Schema Structure with Graph Neural Networks for
