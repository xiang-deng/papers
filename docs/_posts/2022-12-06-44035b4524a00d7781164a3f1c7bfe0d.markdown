Previous research has shown that the design of Meaning Representation (MR) greatly influences model performance of a neural semantic parser. Therefore, designing a good MR is a long-term goal for semantic parsing. However, it is still an art as there is no quantitative indicator that can tell us which MR among a set of candidates may have the best final model performance. In practice, in order to select an MR, researchers often have to go through the whole training-testing process for Cites: A syntactic neural model for general-purpose code generation
