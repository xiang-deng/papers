Abstract Recently, multi-head Graph Attention Networks (GATs) have achieved satisfactory performance in Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) tasks by imposing attention mechanism in local information. However, existing GATs based KGE approaches update entities with few neighbors is difficult to obtain structured semantic information, and these methods only use relations to model the local pairwise importance of entities, which result in missing semantic information of entity  Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
