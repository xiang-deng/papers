Abstract In the Natural Language Processing domain, original and controllable text generation techniques are producing creative, original, and realistic results (Keskar et al. 2017). However, there has been limited focus on applying these controlled generation techniques to English language education. This is partly due to the availability of good quality, labelled data, since manually labelling data is costly, time consuming and error prone. To address this issue, this paper proposes to cluster and  Cites: Ctrl: A conditional transformer language model for controllable
