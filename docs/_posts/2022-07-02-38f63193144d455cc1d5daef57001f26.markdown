Knowledge embeddings (KE) represent a knowledge graph (KG) by embedding entities and relations into continuous vector spaces. Existing methods are mainly structure-based or description-based. Structure-based methods learn representations that preserve the inherent structure of KGs. They cannot well represent abundant long-tail entities in real-world KGs with limited structural information. Description-based methods leverage textual information and language
