Answer sentence selection (AS2) modeling requires annotated data, ie, hand- labeled question-answer pairs. We present a strategy to collect weakly supervised answers for a question based on its reference to improve AS2 modeling. Specifically, we introduce Reference-based Weak Supervision (RWS), a fully automatic large- scale data pipeline that harvests high-quality weakly-supervised answers from abundant Web data requiring only a question-reference pair as input. We study the Cites: Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research
