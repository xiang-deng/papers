Writing source code is a challenging task, requiring the understanding of complex concepts, algorithms and programming paradigms. This task becomes increasingly challenging when source code has to be optimized for non-functional properties such as run-time performance, memory usage or energy efficiency. These properties often depend on in-depth knowledge of the language, the compiler and even the hardware archhitecture te sourceb code wil e run on. Cites: Learning to Superoptimize Real-world Programs
