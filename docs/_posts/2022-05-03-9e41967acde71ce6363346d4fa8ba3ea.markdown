The abstraction of data streams encompasses a vast range of diverse applications that continuously generate data and therefore require dedicated algorithms and approaches for exploitation and mining. In this framework both unsupervised and supervised approaches are generally employed, depending on the task and on the availability of annotated data. This thesis proposes novel algorithms and techniques specifically tailored for the streaming setting and for knowledge discovery from Social Cites: Learning sentiment-specific word embedding for twitter sentiment
