The problem of integrating high-level task planning in the execution loop of a real-world robot architecture remains challenging, as the planning times of traditional symbolic planners explode combinatorially with the number of symbols to plan upon. In this paper, we present Teriyaki, a framework for training Large Language Models (LLMs), and in particular the now well-known GPT-3 model, into neurosymbolic planners compatible with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL).
