Speaker identification (SID) in the household scenario (eg, for smart speakers) is an important but challenging problem due to limited number of labeled (enrollment) utterances, confusable voices, and demographic imbalances. Conventional speaker recognition systems generalize from a large random sample of speakers, causing the recognition to underperform for households drawn from specific cohorts or otherwise exhibiting high confusability. In this work, we propose a graph-based semi Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
