In the mobile-edge-cloud continuum, a plethora of heterogeneous data sources and computation-capable nodes are available. Such nodes can cooperate to perform a distributed learning task, aided by a learning controller (often located at the network edge). The controller is required to make decisions concerning (i) data selection, ie, which data sources to use;(ii) model selection, ie, which machine learning model to adopt, and (iii) matching between the layers of the model and the available physical …
