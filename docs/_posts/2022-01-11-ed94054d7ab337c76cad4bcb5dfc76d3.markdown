Recent breakthroughs in the Deep Learning field have resulted in neural models surpassing human intelligence in a variety of specialized tasks. Modern neural networks have proven their effectiveness in object detection and segmentation applications. However, real-time performance is becoming more challenging for them, especially in cases when a vehicle s autonomy depends on its ability to perceive the surrounding environment within moments. As a result, model Cites: ESPNetv2: A Light-weight, Power Efficient, and General Purpose
