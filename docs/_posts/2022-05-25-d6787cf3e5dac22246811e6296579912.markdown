Accurate short-term forecasting of the individual residential load is a challenging task due to the nonlinear behavior of the residential customer. Moreover, there are a large number of features that have impact on the energy consumption of the residential load. Recently, deep learning algorithms are widely used for short-term load forecasting (STLF) of residential load. Although deep learning algorithms are capable of achieving promising results due to their ability in feature extraction  Cites: Empirical evaluation of gated recurrent neural networks on
