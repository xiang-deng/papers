Conversational recommendation system (CRS) aims at recommending appropriate items to the user through a multi-turn conversation. The end-to-end CRS is a type of CRS that models the recommendation task and the conversation task simultaneously which has attracted more and more attention in recent years. At the same time, knowledge graph and Transformer are incorporated into the end-to-end CRS to generate better recommendations and better responses to the user, which makes the  Cites: Evidence-aware inferential text generation with vector quantised
