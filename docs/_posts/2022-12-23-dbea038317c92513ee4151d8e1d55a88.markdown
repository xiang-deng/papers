A coreference resolution system is to cluster all mentions that refer to the same entity in a given context. All coreference resolution systems need to tackle two main tasks: one task is to detect all of the potential mentions, and the other is to learn the linking of an antecedent for each possible mention. In this paper, we propose a hybrid rule-neural coreference resolution system based on actor-critic learning, such that it can achieve better coreference performance by leveraging the advantages from both the …
