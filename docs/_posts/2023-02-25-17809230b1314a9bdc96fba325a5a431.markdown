Distant supervision employs external knowledge bases to automatically label corpora. The labeled sentences in a corpus are usually packaged and trained for relation extraction using a multi-instance learning paradigm. The automated distant supervision inevitably introduces label noises. Previous studies that used sentence-level attention mechanisms to de-noise neither considered correlation among sentences in a bag nor correlation among bags. As a result, a large amount of Cites: Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text
