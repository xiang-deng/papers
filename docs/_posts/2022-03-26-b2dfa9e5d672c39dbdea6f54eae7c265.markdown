A considerable amount of data related to space mission design has been accumulated since artificial satellites started to venture into space in the 1950s. This data has today become an overwhelming volume of information, triggering a significant knowledge reuse bottleneck at the early stages of space mission design. Meanwhile, virtual assistants, text mining and Natural Language Processing techniques have become pervasive to our daily life.
