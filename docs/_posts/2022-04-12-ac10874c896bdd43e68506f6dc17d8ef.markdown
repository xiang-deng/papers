The large transformer-based language models demonstrate excellent performance in natural language processing. By considering the closeness of natural languages to the high-level programming language such as C/C++, this work studies how good are the large transformer-based language models detecting software vulnerabilities. Our results demonstrate the well performance of these models on software vulnerability detection. The answer enables extending transformer-based language Cites: Dawn Drain, Neel Sundaresan, Jian Yin, Daxin Jiang, and Ming
