As few-shot relation classification requires less data to train the neural network models, high costs related to data collection and labeling are eliminated. Compared with the traditional few-shot task, the interdisciplinary few-shot relation classification faces many semantic gap issues (eg, common sense, subject terminology and insufficient migratable information), bringing the linguistic bias between the testing phase and the training phase. Previous methods mainly focus on the training phase Cites: Natural language to structured query generation via meta-learning
