The collaborative filtering (CF) problem with only user-item interaction information can be solved by graph signal processing (GSP), which uses low-pass filters to smooth the observed interaction signals on the similarity graph to obtain the prediction signals. However, the interaction signal may not be sufficient to accurately characterize user interests and the low-pass filters may ignore the useful information contained in the high-frequency component of the observed signals, resulting in Cites: Adaptive Graph Encoder for Attributed Graph Embedding
