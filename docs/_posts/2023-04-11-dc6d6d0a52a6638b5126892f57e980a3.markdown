Food-derived bioactive peptides (FBPs) are gaining interest due to their great potential in agricultural byproduct valorization and high-activity peptide screening. The introduction of bioinformatics into FBP studies further enhances the prospects of this field. This review provides a comprehensive overview and critical insight into the latest advances in bioinformatics-driven FBPs studies. The roles of databases, proteolysis simulation, bioactivity potency evaluation, quantitative structure-activity Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
