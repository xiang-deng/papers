One of the main methods for semantic interpretation of text is mapping it into a vector in some embedding space. Such vectors can then be used for a variety of text processing tasks. Recently, most embedding spaces are a product of training large language models. One major drawback of this type of representation is its incomprehensibility to humans. Understanding the embedding space is crucial for several important needs, including the need to explain the decision of a system that Cites: Explaining and improving model behavior with k nearest neighbor
