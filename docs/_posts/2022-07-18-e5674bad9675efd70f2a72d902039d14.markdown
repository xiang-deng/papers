Automatic theorem proving with deep learning methods has attracted attentions recently. In this paper, we construct an automatic proof system for trigonometric identities. We define the normalized form of trigonometric identities, design a set of rules for the proof and put forward a method which can generate theoretically infinite trigonometric identities. Our goal is not only to complete the proof, but to complete the proof in as few steps as possible. For this reason, we design a model to learn proof Cites: End-to-end differentiable proving
