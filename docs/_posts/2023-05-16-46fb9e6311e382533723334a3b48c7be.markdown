Abstract Natural Language Generation (NLG) is one of the most critical yet challenging tasks in all Natural Language Processing applications. It is a process to automate text generation so that humans can understand its meaning. A handful of research articles published in the literature have described how NLG can produce understandable texts in various languages. The use of sequence-to-sequence modeling powered by deep learning techniques such as Long Term Short Term  Cites: Text generation from tables
