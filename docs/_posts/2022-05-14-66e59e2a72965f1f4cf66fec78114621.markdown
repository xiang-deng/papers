Dense retrievers encode texts and map them in an embedding space using pre- trained language models. These embeddings are critical to keep high-dimensional for effectively training dense retrievers, but lead to a high cost of storing index and retrieval. To reduce the embedding dimensions of dense retrieval, this paper proposes a Conditional Autoencoder (ConAE) to compress the high-dimensional embeddings to maintain the same embedding distribution and better recover the Cites: Sewon Min, Ledell Wu, Sergey Edunov, Danqi Chen, and Wentau
