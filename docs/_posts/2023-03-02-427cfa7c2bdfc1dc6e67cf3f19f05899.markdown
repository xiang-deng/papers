Lack of explainability is a key factor limiting the practical adoption of high-performant Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) controllers. Explainable RL for networking hitherto used salient input features to interpret a controller s behavior. However, these feature-based solutions do not completely explain the controller s decision-making process. Often, operators are interested in understanding the impact of a controller s actions on performance in the future, which feature-based solutions …
