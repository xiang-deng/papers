Machine learning (ML) has made enormous progress in the last two decades. Specifically, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have led to several breakthroughs. The applications range from synthesizing high-resolution images that are indistinguishable from real photos to large-scale language models that achieve human-level performance on various tasks. Yet, while humans can apply learned knowledge to new situations with only a few examples, neural networks often fail at …
