Few-shot relation extraction (FSRE) aims at recognizing unseen relations by learning with merely a handful of annotated instances. To generalize to new relations more effectively, this paper proposes a novel pipeline for the FSRE task based on queRy-information guided Attention and adaptive Prototype fuSion, namely RAPS. Specifically, RAPS first derives the relation prototype by the query-information guided attention module, which exploits rich interactive information between the support …
