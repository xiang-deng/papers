Recent advances in the field of natural language processing were achieved with deep learning models. This led to a wide range of new research questions concerning the stability of such large-scale systems and their applicability beyond well-studied tasks and datasets, such as information extraction in non-standard domains and languages, in particular, in low-resource environments. In this work, we address these challenges and make important contributions across fields such as …
