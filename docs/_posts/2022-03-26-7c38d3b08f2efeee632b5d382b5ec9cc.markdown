Deep semi-supervised learning is becoming an active research topic because it jointly utilizes labeled and unlabeled samples in training deep neural networks. Recent advances are mainly focused on inductive semi-supervised learning which generally extends supervised algorithms to include unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose CL_PLP, a new transductive deep semi-supervised learning algorithm based on contrastive self-supervised learning and partial label propagation.
