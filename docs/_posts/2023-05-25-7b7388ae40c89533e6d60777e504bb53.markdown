Tools serve as pivotal interfaces that enable humans to understand and reshape the world. With the advent of foundational models, AI systems can utilize tools to expand their capabilities and interact with the world. Existing tool learning methodologies, encompassing supervised fine-tuning and prompt engineering approaches, often induce language models to utilize tools indiscriminately, as complex problems often exceed their own competencies. However, introducing tools for simple tasks, which Cites: Rainier: Reinforced knowledge introspector for commonsense
