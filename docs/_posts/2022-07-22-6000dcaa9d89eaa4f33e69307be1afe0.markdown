Abstract Multi-hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graph (multi-hop KGQA) is a challenging task since it requires reasoning with multiple triplets over knowledge graph to find the correct answer entities. Benefiting from expeditious development of attention mechanism and graph neural network, recent works in multi-hop KGQA based on information retrieval have made great progress. However, most existing works focus on encoding questions and knowledge graph in isolation so that the Cites: The web as a knowledge-base for answering complex questions
