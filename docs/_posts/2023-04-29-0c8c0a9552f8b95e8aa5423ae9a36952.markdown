With growing size of Neural Networks (NNs), model sparsification to reduce the computational cost and memory demand for model inference has become of vital interest for both research and production. While many sparsification methods have been proposed and successfully applied on individual models, to the best of our knowledge their behavior and robustness has not yet been studied on large populations of models. With this paper, we address that gap by applying two popular  Cites: Editing Models with Task Arithmetic
