Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models are an effective and popular approach to represent and reason with multi-relational data. Prior studies have shown that KGE models are sensitive to hyperparameter settings, however, and that suitable choices are dataset-dependent. In this paper, we explore hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for very large knowledge graphs, where the cost of evaluating individual hyperparameter configurations is excessive. Prior studies often avoided this cost by  Cites: Observed Versus Latent Features for Knowledge Base and Text
