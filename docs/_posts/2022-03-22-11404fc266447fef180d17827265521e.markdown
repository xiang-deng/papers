Abstract Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) is the task of extracting structured information from text. Recent advances in applying Deep Learning to OpenIE tasks have improved the state of the art for the task, although few works have been produced for languages other than English. In this work, we propose PortNOIE, a neural framework for open information extraction for the Portuguese language. We evaluate our method on a manually annotated corpus of Open IE extractions Cites: Open information extraction from the web
