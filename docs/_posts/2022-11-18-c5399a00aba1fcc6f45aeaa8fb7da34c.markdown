Deep learning has achieved great success in learning features from massive remote sensing images (RSIs). To better understand the connection between feature learning paradigms (eg, unsupervised feature learning (USFL), supervised feature learning (SFL), and self-supervised feature learning (SSFL)), this paper analyzes and compares them from the perspective of feature learning signals, and gives a unified feature learning framework. Under this unified framework, we analyze the …
