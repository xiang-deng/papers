Multimedia summarization with multimodal output can play an essential role in real- world applications, ie, automatically generating cover images and titles for news articles or providing introductions to online videos. In this work, we propose a multimodal hierarchical multimedia summarization (MHMS) framework by interacting visual and language domains to generate both video and textual summaries. Our MHMS method contains video and textual segmentation and summarization module Cites: Text summarization with pretrained encoders
