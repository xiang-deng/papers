Urban green space plays a crucial role in the construction of ecological city and livable environment. While multi-temporal remote sensing images provide strong support for urban green cover monitoring, they often suffer from data shifting, where the data distribution varies from phase to phase. Designing a general multi-temporal framework to extract urban green cover is challenging, mainly due to possible time-consuming data-labeling and inconsistent prediction. To address that, we propose …
