Conversational, multi-turn, text-to-SQL (CoSQL) tasks map natural language utterances in a dialogue to SQL queries. State-of-the-art (SOTA) systems use large, pre-trained and finetuned language models, such as the T5-family, in conjunction with constrained decoding. With multi-tasking (MT) over coherent tasks with discrete prompts during training, we improve over specialized text-to-SQL T5-family models. Based on Oracle analyses over n-best hypotheses, we apply a query plan model and  Cites: Exploring unexplored generalization challenges for cross
