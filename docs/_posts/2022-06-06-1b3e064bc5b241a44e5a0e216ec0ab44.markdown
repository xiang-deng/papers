Task-oriented dialogue systems employ third-party APIs to serve end-users via natural language interactions. while existing advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have produced promising and useful results to recognize user intents, the synthesis of API calls to support a broad range of potentially complex user intents is still largely a manual and costly process. In this paper, we propose a new approach to recognize and realize complex  Cites: Find or classify? dual strategy for slot-value predictions on multi
