Proximal femur fractures represent a major health concern, and substantially contribute to the morbidity of elderly. Correct classification and diagnosis of hip fractures has a significant impact on mortality, costs and hospital stay. In this paper, we present a method and empirical validation for automatic subclassification of proximal femur fractures and Dutch radiological report generation that does not rely on manually curated data. The fracture classification model was trained on 11,000 X Cites: Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with
