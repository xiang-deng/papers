The growing interaction between humans and machines raises the necessity to more sophisticated tools for natural language understanding. Dependency parsing is crucial for capturing the semantics of a sentence. Although graph-based dependency parsing approaches outperform transition-based methods because they are not exposed to error propagation as their compeer, their feature space is comparatively limited. Thus, the main issue with graph-based parsing is how to expand the set of Cites: Deep unordered composition rivals syntactic methods for text
