Few-shot named entity recognition (NER) aims at identifying named entities based on only few labeled instances. Most existing prototype-based sequence labeling models tend to memorize entity mentions which would be easily confused by close prototypes. In this paper, we proposed a Prototypical Semantic Decoupling method via joint Contrastive learning (PSDC) for few-shot NER. Specifically, we decouple class-specific prototypes and contextual semantic prototypes by two masking …
