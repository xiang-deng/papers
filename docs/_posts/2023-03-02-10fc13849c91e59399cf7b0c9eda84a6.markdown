The study of the interrelations between the composition and properties of materials is greatly significant for accelerating the research and development of new materials. Knowledge graph reasoning provides effective support for exploring potential materials information by structuring graph data and creating linkages. However, the nature of materials data leads to sparse graph structures that differ from those typically encountered in benchmark datasets. To understand what the implications of …
