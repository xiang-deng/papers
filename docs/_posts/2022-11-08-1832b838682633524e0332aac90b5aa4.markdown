As the basis of many artificial intelligence tasks, text similarity measurement has received extensive attention in current studies. However, few of them focus on the resource-limited scenes (ie, limited computational resources and few training datasets), which are becoming increasingly popular and challenging with the development of the Internet of Things. Worse still, popular methods such as the deep-neural-network-based methods may lose their power in such scenes, since they  Cites: Deep Unordered Composition Rivals Syntactic Methods for Text
