Abstract In recent years, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been widely used in applications such as search engines and Q&A systems. During construction, errors were inevitably introduced and KGs may contain many incorrect facts. However, most KG representation learning methods assume that all triple facts are correct, making KG noise detection a challenge. Although some knowledge representation methods are based on a confidence-aware framework, they are usually limited by the  Cites: Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text
