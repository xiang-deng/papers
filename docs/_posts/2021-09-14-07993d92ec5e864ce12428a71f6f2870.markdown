Identifying vulnerable code is a precautionary measure to counter software security breaches. Tedious expert effort has been spent to build static analyzers, yet insecure patterns are barely fully enumerated. This work explores a deep learning approach to automatically learn the insecure patterns from code corpora. Because code naturally admits graph structures with parsing, we develop a novel graph neural network (GNN) to exploit both the semantic context and structural regularity of a Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
