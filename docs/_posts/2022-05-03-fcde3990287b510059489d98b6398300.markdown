With the increasing demand for multi-media data retrieval in different modalities, cross-modal retrieval algorithms based on deep learning are constantly updated. However, most of them have trouble with large model parameters and insufficient intrinsic nature between different modalities. We proposed a Light-weight Transformer Alignment Network (LTAN), which adopts the current mainstream visual and textual feature extraction methods.
