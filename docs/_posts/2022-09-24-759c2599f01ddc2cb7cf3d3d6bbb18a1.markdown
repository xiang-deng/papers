The past few years have witnessed the wide application of machine learning models to fix vulnerabilities automatically. However, existing approaches cannot capture the characteristics of vulnerabilities that are helpful to improve the effectiveness of automated vulnerability fixing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automatically fixing vulnerabilities, called SPVF. SPVF captures the security property from the descriptive information about the vulnerability. SPVF is based on the Cites: Graph-based, self-supervised program repair from diagnostic
