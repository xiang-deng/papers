This work demonstrates that a transfer learning-based deep learning model can perform unambiguous classification based on microscopic images of material surfaces with a high degree of accuracy. A transfer learning-enhanced deep learning model was successfully used in combination with an innovative approach for eliminating noisy data based on automatic selection using pixel sum values, which was refined over different epochs to develop and evaluate an effective model for …
