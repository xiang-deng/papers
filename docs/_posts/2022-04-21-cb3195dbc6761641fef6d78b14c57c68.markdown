Recently, the fusion of images and point clouds has received appreciable attentions in various fields, for example, autonomous driving, whose advantage over single- modal vision has been verified. However, it has not been extensively exploited in the scene captioning task. In this paper, a novel scene captioning framework with deep fusion of images and point clouds based on region correlation and attention is proposed to improve performances of captioning models. In our model, a Cites: Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with
