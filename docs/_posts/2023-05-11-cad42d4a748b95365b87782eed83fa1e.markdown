In the context of multitask learning (MTL), representation learning is often accomplished through a feature-extractor that is shared across all tasks. This way, intuitively, the statistical cost of learning is collaboratively split across all tasks which enables sample efficiency. In this work, we consider a novel fairness scenario where T tasks can be split into majority and minority groups of sizes T maj and T min respectively: The group assignments are unknown during MTL and T min/T maj ratio Cites: Weighted training for cross-task learning
