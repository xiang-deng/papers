Researchers increasingly use unstructured text data to construct quantitative variables for analysis. This goal has traditionally been achieved using keyword‐based approaches, which require researchers to specify a dictionary of keywords mapped to the theoretical concepts of interest. However, recent machine learning (ML) tools for text classification and natural language processing can be used to construct quantitative variables and to classify unstructured text documents. In this …
