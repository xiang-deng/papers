We study generalizable policy learning from demonstrations for complex low-level control tasks (eg, contact-rich object manipulations). We propose an imitation learning method that incorporates the idea of temporal abstraction and the planning capabilities from Hierarchical RL (HRL) in a novel and effective manner. As a step towards decision foundation models, our design can utilize scalable, albeit highly sub-optimal, demonstrations. Specifically, we find certain short subsequences of the  Cites: Chain of thought prompting elicits reasoning in large language
