This paper proposes a novel approach to intent-expressive motion planning and intent estimation for agents/robots with uncertain discrete-time affine dynamics. In contrast to the more commonly considered stochastic settings, our intent-expressive trajectory planning approach is set-based and leverages the active model discrimination framework for designing optimal inputs to attain certain target/goal states, while allowing an observer/teammate to clearly infer the intended goal based  Cites: Legibility and predictability of robot motion
