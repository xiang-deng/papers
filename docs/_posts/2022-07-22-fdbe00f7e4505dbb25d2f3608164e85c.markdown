Abstract Knowledge graphs have been applied in question answering. Many researchers have proposed methods based on query graph generation, but there are some defects such as high cost of query graph generation and large search scope of knowledge graphs. Especially for the complex questions, which refer to those with multi-hop relations and constraints, there are problems such as incomplete search and inaccurate selection of answers.
