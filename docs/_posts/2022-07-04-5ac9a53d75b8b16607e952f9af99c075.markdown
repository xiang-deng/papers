ABSTRACT A large number of publications have incorporated deep learning in the process of remote sensing change detection. In these Deep Learning Change Detection (DLCD) publications, deep learning methods have demonstrated their superiority over conventional change detection methods. However, the theoretical underpinnings of why deep learning improves the performance of change detection remain unresolved. As of today, few in-depth reviews have investigated the  Cites: Never-ending learning
