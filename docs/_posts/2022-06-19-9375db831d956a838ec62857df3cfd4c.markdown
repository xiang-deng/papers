This paper presents our research approach and findings towards maximizing the accuracy of our classifier of feature claims for cybersecurity literature analytics, and introduces the resulting model ClaimsBERT. Its architecture, after extensive evaluations of different approaches, introduces a feature map concatenated with a Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) model. We discuss deployment of this new concept and the research insights that resulted in the
