Abstract Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a functional material with a large specific surface area and high porosity have attracted increasing attention for their great potential in various applications. As a relatively time-saving, cost-effective, high-efficient and results-predictable method, theoretical calculation has gradually become a trend to guide MOFs material design and development. In this review, the most recent advances in theoretical studies of MOFs were systemically summarized  Cites: Theoretical limits of hydrogen storage in metalorganic
