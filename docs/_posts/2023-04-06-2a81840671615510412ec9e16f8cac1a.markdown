Predicting link states on dynamic attributed networks is one of the most fundamental problems for network analysis. To accurately predict the formations and disappearances of links, we need to utilize three types of information, that is, structural information, node content information, and temporal information, simultaneously. To this end, we propose a novel approach called LUSTC for predicting links and unlinks with structural information, temporal information, and …
