Capsules (vector-valued neurons) have recently become a more active area of research in neural networks. However, existing formulations have several drawbacks including the large number of trainable parameters that they require as well as the reliance on routing mechanisms between layers of capsules. The primary aim of this project is to demonstrate the benefits of a new formulation of capsules called Homogeneous Vector Capsules (HVCs) that overcome these drawbacks.
