Machine learning (ML) has emerged as an indispensable methodology to describe, discover, and predict complex physical phenomena that efficiently help us learn underlying functional rules, especially in cases when conventional modeling approaches cannot be applied. While conventional feedforward neural networks are typically limited to performing tasks related to static patterns in data, recursive models can both work iteratively based on a changing input and discover complex dynamical Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
