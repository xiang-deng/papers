This paper reports on creating virtual assistants (VA) that enable users to query a database in the natural language. Building SQL queries from the natural language is a complicated task. We build the query via a conversation between the user and the virtual assistant allowing the users to describe their needs during a more detailed conversation. The VA uses information about the schema of the data source to guide the user. The query is built incrementally. To test the proposed method, we  Cites: Semantic parsing with syntax-and table-aware sql generation
