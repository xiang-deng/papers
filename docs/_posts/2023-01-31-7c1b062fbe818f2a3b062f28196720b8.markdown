Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) systems have recently achieved unprecedented high performance and have approached or even exceeded the human level. However, almost all these systems only focus on integrating knowledge and designing the WSD classification layer while having few works related to loss function, which is equally essential for WSD systems. In this paper, we propose Enhanced Bi-encoder Model (EBEM) with a more flexible loss function, Circle loss Cites: Moving down the long tail of word sense disambiguation with gloss
