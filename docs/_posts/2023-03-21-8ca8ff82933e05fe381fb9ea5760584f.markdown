In machine learning, an informative dataset is crucial for accurate predictions. However, high dimensional data often contains irrelevant features, outliers, and noise, which can negatively impact model performance and consume computational resources. To tackle this challenge, the Bird s Eye View (BEV) feature selection technique is introduced. This approach is inspired by the natural world, where a bird searches for important features in a sparse dataset, similar to how a bird search for Cites: scBERT as a large-scale pretrained deep language model for cell
