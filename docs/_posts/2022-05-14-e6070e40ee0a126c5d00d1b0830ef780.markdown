Creating labeled natural language training data is expensive and requires significant human effort. We mine input output examples from large corpora using a supervised mining function trained using a small seed set of only 100 examples. The mining consists of two stages--(1) a biencoder-based recall-oriented dense search which pairs inputs with potential outputs, and (2) a crossencoder-based filter which re-ranks the output of the biencoder stage for better precision.
