We propose to use reinforcement learning to inform transformer-based contextualized link prediction models by providing paths that are most useful for predicting the correct answer. This is in contrast to previous approaches, that either used reinforcement learning (RL) to directly search for the answer, or based their prediction on limited or randomly selected context. Our experiments on WN18RR and FB15k-237 show that contextualized link prediction models consistently …
