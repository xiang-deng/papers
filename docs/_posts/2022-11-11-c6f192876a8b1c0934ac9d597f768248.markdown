Estimating treatment effects from observational data is a central problem in causal inference. Methods to solve this problem exploit inductive biases and heuristics from causal inference to design multi-head neural network architectures and regularizers. In this work, we propose to use neurosymbolic program synthesis, a data-efficient, and interpretable technique, to solve the treatment effect estimation problem. We theoretically show that neurosymbolic programming can solve the treatment effect  Cites: Neuro-symbolic program synthesis
