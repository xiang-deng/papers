In recent years Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have made significant progress in computer vision. These advancements have been applied to other areas, such as remote sensing and have shown satisfactory results. However, the lack of large labeled datasets and the inherent complexity of remote sensing problems have made it difficult to train deep CNNs for dense prediction problems. To solve this issue, ImageNet pretrained weights have been used as a starting point in various  Cites: A framework for contrastive self-supervised learning and designing
