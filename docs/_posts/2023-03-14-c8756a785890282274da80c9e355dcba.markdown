Visual prompt learning, as a newly emerged technique, leverages the knowledge learned by a large-scale pre-trained model and adapts it to downstream tasks through the usage of prompts. While previous research has focused on designing effective prompts, in this work, we argue that compared to prompt design, a good mapping strategy matters more. In this sense, we propose SeMap, a more effective mapping using the semantic alignment between the pre-trained model s knowledge …
