Data compression means the route towards adjusting, encoding or changing the bit structure of information so that it requires less space. The fundamental standard behind compression is to build up a strategy or convention for utilizing less bits to express the actual data. Character encoding is fairly identified with compression of data that illustrate a character by a kind of encoding system. We proposes an efficient and simple compression algorithm for large natural text named n-Sequence based m …
