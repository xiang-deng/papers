This paper proposes a distributed version of Determinant Point Processing (DPP) inference to enhance multi-source data diversification under limited communication bandwidth. DPP is a popular probabilistic approach that improves data diversity by enforcing the repulsion of elements in the selected subsets. The well-studied Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference in DPP aims to identify the subset with the highest diversity quantified by DPP. However, this approach is limited by the  Cites: Multi-document summarization with determinantal point process
