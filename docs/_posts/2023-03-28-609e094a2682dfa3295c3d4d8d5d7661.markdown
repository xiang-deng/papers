Machine learning models with various tensor operators are becoming ubiquitous in recent years. There are two types of operators in machine learning: compute-intensive operators (eg, GEMM and convolution) and memory-intensive operators (eg, ReLU and softmax). In emerging machine learning models, compute-intensive operators are usually organized in a chain structure. With the continual specialization of hardware, the gap between computing performance and memory bandwidth has …
