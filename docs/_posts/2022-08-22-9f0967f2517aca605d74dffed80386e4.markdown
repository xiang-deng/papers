Multi-view subspace clustering, which aims to partition a dataset into its relevant subspaces based on their multi-view features, has been widely applied to identify various characteristics of datasets. The typical model of multi-view subspace clustering in literature often makes use of the nuclear norm to seek the underlying low-rank representation. However, due to the sum property of the singular values dened by tensor nuclear norm, the existing multi-view subspace clustering does not Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
