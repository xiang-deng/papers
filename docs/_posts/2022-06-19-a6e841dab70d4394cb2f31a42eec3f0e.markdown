Abstract Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is a research field that automates machine learning processes and optimizes their costs. As machine learning begins to be widely used, many users in industry and academia are paying attention to AutoML. However, to satisfy the different demands in their various fields, the AutoML systems have been defined and studied differently according to several requirements. This paper classifies various characteristics of the AutoML systems Cites: AlphaD3M: Machine learning pipeline synthesis
