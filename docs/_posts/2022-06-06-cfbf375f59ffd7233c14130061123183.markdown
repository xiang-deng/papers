We are currently experiencing a revolution in data production and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Data are produced much faster than they can be consumed. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop AI algorithms for all aspects of modern life. Furthermore, the medical field is a fertile field in which to apply AI techniques. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers and a leading cause of death around the world. Early detection is critical to treating the disease effectively …
