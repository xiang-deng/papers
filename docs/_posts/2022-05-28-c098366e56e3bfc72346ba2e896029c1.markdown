Semi-parametric models, which augment generation with retrieval, have led to impressive results in language modeling and machine translation, due to their ability to leverage information retrieved from a datastore of examples. One of the most prominent approaches, $ k $ NN-MT, has an outstanding performance on domain adaptation by retrieving tokens from a domain-specific datastore\citep {khandelwal2020nearest}. However, $ k $ NN-MT requires retrieval for every single  Cites: Topic models for dynamic translation model adaptation
