Opponent modeling is necessary for autonomous agents to capture the intents of others during strategic interactions. Most previous works assume that they can access enough interaction history to build the model. However, it may not be realistic. To solve this problem, we present a novel rationality-consistent opponent modeling (ROM) method for games with imperfect information. In our approach, a game-theoretical concept of consistence about rationality is proposed to take advantage of  Cites: Few-shot Language Coordination by Modeling Theory of Mind
