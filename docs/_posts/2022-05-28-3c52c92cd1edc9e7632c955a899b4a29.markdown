It is increasingly common to solve combinatorial optimisation problems that are partially-specified. We survey the case where the objective function or the relations between variables are not known or are only partially specified. The challenge is to learn them from available data, while taking into account a set of hard constraints that a solution must satisfy, and that solving the optimisation problem (esp. during learning) is computationally very demanding. This paper overviews four seemingly … Cites: ‪Learning and inference for structured prediction: A unifying …‬
