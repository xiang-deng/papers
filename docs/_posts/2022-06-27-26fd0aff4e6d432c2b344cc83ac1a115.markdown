The constant evolution of biomedicine, biophysics and biochemistry has enabled scientists to investigate and study each cell identity via analyzing the transciptome and its kinetics, the chromatin accessibility patterns but also via investigating the structure of proteins and RNA. Taking all this under consideration, scientists have developed algorithms and machine learning (ML) schemes that take advantage of the current state-of-the-art approaches to predict the cell states, discover the exact …
