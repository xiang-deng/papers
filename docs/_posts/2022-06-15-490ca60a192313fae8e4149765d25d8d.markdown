In some stock markets, stock prices are not allowed to rise above a daily limit to restrain the surge of price (called price limit). When the price limit occurs, investors tend to chase the continuing upward momentum for profit-making. However, For the stocks that hit daily price limit, we observe whether they close at daily price limit will lead to the opposite price trends of the next trading day. Therefore, this work aims to predict whether a stock that hits its daily price limit will also close at the same price Cites: Relation structure-aware heterogeneous information network
