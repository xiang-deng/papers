Sequential recommendation problems have received increased research interest in recent years. In such scenarios, the task is to suggest items to users to consume next, given their past interaction history, eg, the next movie to watch or the next item to place in the shopping cart. A number of machine learning models were proposed recently for the task of sequential recommendation, with the latest ones based on deep learning techniques, in particular on Transformers.
