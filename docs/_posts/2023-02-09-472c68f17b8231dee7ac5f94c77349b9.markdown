We study the design of incentive mechanisms for the problem of information elicitation without verification (IEWV). In IEWV, a data requester seeks to design proper incentives to optimize the tradeoff between the quality of information (collected from distributed crowd workers) and the total cost of incentives (provided to crowd workers) without verifiable ground truth. While prior work often relies on sufficient knowledge of worker information, we study a scenario where the data …
