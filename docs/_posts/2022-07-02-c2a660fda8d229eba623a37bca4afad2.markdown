In recent years, due to the characteristics of graph convolutional networks (GCN) that can effectively integrate node information and topological structure, they have shown strong capabilities in graph data representation learning. Since the data in the social recommender systems exists in a graph structure, these characteristics of GNN greatly promote the development of social recommendation. However, the construction of GCN-based social recommender systems faces the following …
