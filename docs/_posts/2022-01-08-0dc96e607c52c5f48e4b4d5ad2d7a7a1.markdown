There is amazing progress in Deep Learning based models for Image captioning and Low Light image enhancement. For the first time in literature, this paper develops a Deep Learning model that translates night scenes to sentences, opening new possibilities for AI applications in the safety of visually impaired women. Inspired by Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering, a novel Interactive Image Captioning is developed.
