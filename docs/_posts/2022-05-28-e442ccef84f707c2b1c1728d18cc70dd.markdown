Dense retrievers encode documents into fixed dimensional embeddings. However, storing all the document embeddings within an index produces bulky indexes which are expensive to serve. Recently, BPR (Yamada et al., 2021) and JPQ (Zhan et al., 2021a) have been proposed which train the model to produce binary document vectors, which reduce the index 32x and more. The authors showed these binary embedding models significantly outperform more traditional index compression  Cites: Efficient passage retrieval with hashing for open-domain question
