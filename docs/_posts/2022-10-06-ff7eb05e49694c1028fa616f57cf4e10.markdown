In many industries it is too dangerous or expensive to learn via online interaction with the real-world. The goal of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is therefore to learn a policy solely from collected data. Using this data, offline model-based RL (MBRL) methods employ supervised learning to train a model of the world (a dynamics model), against which a learning agent can safely interact. In our work, we define domain generalisation with reference to the logging/behavioural policies employed …
