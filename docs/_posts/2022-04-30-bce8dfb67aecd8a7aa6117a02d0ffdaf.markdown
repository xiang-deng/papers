Recently, computational social scientists have proposed exciting new methods for mapping meaning space and analysing the structure and evolution of complex cultural constructs from large text datasets. These emerging approaches to  cultural cartography are based on a foundation of neural network word embeddings that represent the meaning of words, in relation to one another, as vectors in a shared highdimensional latent space. These new methods have the potential to Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
