Sequential pattern analysis has become a mature topic with a lot of techniques for a variety of sequential pattern mining-related problems. Moreover, tailored solutions for specific domains, such as business process mining, have been developed. However, there is a gap in the literature for advanced techniques for efficient detection of arbitrary sequences in large collections of activity logs. In this work, we introduce the SIESTA (S calable i nfrastructur e of s equential pa t tern a nalysis) solution making a Cites: The Seattle report on database research
