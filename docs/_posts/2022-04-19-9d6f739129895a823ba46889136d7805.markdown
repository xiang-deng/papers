Row completion is the task of augmenting a given table of text and numbers with additional, relevant rows. The task divides into two steps: subject suggestion, the task of populating the main column; and gap filling, the task of populating the remaining columns. We present state-of-the-art results for subject suggestion and gap filling measured on a standard benchmark (WikiTables). Our idea is to solve this task by harmoniously combining knowledge base table interpretation and free text Cites: TaBERT: Pretraining for joint understanding of textual and tabular
