Advanced analytics are fundamental to transform large manufacturing data into resourceful knowledge for various purposes. In its very nature, such industrial big data can relay its usefulness to reach further utilitarian applications. In this context, Machine Learning (ML) is among the major predictive modeling approaches that can enable manufacturing researchers and practitioners to improve the product quality and achieve resource efficiency by exploiting large amounts of data (which is Cites: AlphaD3M: Machine learning pipeline synthesis
