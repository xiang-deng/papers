In recent years, knowledge graphs have been considered as pyramids of interconnected data enriched with semantics for complex decision-making. The potential of knowledge graphs and the demand for interpretability of machine learning models in diverse domains (eg, healthcare) have gained more attention. The lack of model transparency impacts negatively the understanding and, in consequence, interpretability of the predictions made by a model.
