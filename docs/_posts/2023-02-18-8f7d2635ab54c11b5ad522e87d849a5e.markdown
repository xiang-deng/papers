Estimating the position of someone s head is a difficult problem with many potential uses. Many methods almost solved head pose estimation problems but They are not suitable for edge devices and embedded systems because they are computationally expensive. In this paper, a deep learning network based on a modified MobileNetV3 architecture is proposed to reduce the computational cost with results comparable to heavy methods. The proposed method is pruned to achieve even less computational  Cites: Good subnetworks provably exist: Pruning via greedy forward
