Few-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task aiming to identify named entities via limited annotated samples. Recently, prototypical networks have shown promising performance in few-shot NER. Most of prototypical networks will utilize the entities from the support set to construct label prototypes and use the query set to compute span-level similarities and optimize these label prototype representations. However, these methods are usually unsuitable for fine-tuning in the target domain Cites: Label semantics for few shot named entity recognition
