Due to the small sizes of green apples and the similar color of the fruit skin and background in real complex orchard environments, detecting small green apples remains a great challenge. In this paper, we present a focal bottleneck transformer network (FBoT-Net) to incorporate high-level semantic information with strong representation ability and global and local feature information through the focal bottleneck transformer module. We replace the multi-head self-attention with a focal …
