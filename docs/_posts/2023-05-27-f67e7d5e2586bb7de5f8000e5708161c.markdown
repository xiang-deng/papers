Conventional supervised approaches for text-to-SQL parsing often require large amounts of annotated data, which is costly to obtain in practice. Recently, in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) has caught increasing attention due to its superior few-shot performance in a wide range of tasks. However, most attempts to use in-context learning for text-to-SQL parsing still lag behind supervised methods. We hypothesize that the under-performance is because text-to-SQL parsing requires Cites: Compositional generalization and natural language variation: Can
