Many texts, especially in chemistry and biology, describe complex processes. We focus on texts that describe a chemical reaction process and questions that ask about the process s outcome under different environmental conditions. To answer questions about such processes, one needs to understand the interactions between the different entities involved in the process and to simulate their state transitions during the process execution under different conditions. A state transition is defined Cites: MathQA: Towards interpretable math word problem solving with
