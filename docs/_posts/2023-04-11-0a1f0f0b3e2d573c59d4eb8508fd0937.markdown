Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is a fundamental technique that extracts expressive representation from knowledge graph (KG) to facilitate diverse downstream tasks. The emerging federated KGE (FKGE) collaboratively trains from distributed KGs held among clients while avoiding exchanging clients sensitive raw KGs, which can still suffer from privacy threats as evidenced in other federated model trainings (eg, neural networks). However, quantifying and defending against such Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
