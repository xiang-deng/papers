Recently, a number of new Semi-Supervised Learning methods have emerged. As the accuracy for ImageNet and similar datasets increased over time, the performance on tasks beyond the classification of natural images is yet to be explored. Most Semi-Supervised Learning methods rely on a carefully manually designed data augmentation pipeline that is not transferable for learning on images of other domains. In this work, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning method that …
