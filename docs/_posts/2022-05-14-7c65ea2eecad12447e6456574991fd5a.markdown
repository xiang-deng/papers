Automatic transfer of text between domains has become popular in recent times. One of its aims is to preserve the semantic content of text being translated from source to target domain. However, it does not explicitly maintain other attributes between the source and translated text, for eg, text length and descriptiveness. Maintaining constraints in transfer has several downstream applications, including data augmentation and de-biasing. We introduce a method for such constrained Cites: Beyond BLEU: Training Neural Machine Translation with Semantic
