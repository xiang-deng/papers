This paper proposes an efficient and semi-automated method for human-in-the-loop post-editing for machine translation (MT) corpus generation. The method is based on online training of a custom MT quality estimation metric on-the-fly as linguists perform post-edits. The online estimator is used to prioritize worse hypotheses for post-editing, and auto-close best hypothe-ses without post-editing. This way, significant improvements can be achieved in the resulting quality of post-edits at a lower cost  Cites: Phrase-level Active Learning for Neural Machine Translation
