Identifying temporal relationship between events is crucial to text understanding. Recent work on temporal relation extraction only focuses on single Event-Event (EE) relations, ignoring the other Event-DCT (ED) and Event-Timex (ET) relations and suffering from imbalanced annotation. Moreover, few previous work can directly learn time intervals of events, a critical temporal clue, because the intervals are rarely occur in real-world texts. In this paper, we propose a novel Time interval Anchoring  Cites: Joint constrained learning for event-event relation extraction
