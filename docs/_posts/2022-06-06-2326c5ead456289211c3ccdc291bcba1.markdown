The automatic classification of hyperspectral data is made complex by several factors, such as the high cost of true sample labeling coupled with the high number of spectral bands, as well as the spatial correlation of the spectral signature. In this paper, a transductive collective classifier is proposed for dealing with all these factors in hyperspectral image classification. The transductive inference paradigm allows us to reduce the inference error for the given set of unlabeled data, as sparsely labeled …
