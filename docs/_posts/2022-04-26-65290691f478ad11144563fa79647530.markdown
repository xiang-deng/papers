Sleep staging has been widely used as an approach in sleep diagnoses at sleep clinics. Graph neural network (GNN)-based methods have been extensively applied for automatic sleep stage classifications with significant results. However, the existing GNN-based methods rely on a static adjacency matrix to capture the features of the different electroencephalogram (EEG) channels, which cannot grasp the information of each electrode. Meanwhile, these methods ignore the importance of Cites: Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for
