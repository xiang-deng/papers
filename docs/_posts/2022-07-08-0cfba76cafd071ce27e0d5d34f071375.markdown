Prediction of metallurgical responses during the flotation process is extremely vital to increase the process efficiency using a proper modeling approach. In this study, two new variants of the recurrent neural network (RNN) method were used to predict the copper ore flotation indices, ie, grade and recovery within different operating conditions. The model input parameters including pulp pH and solid content as well as frother and collector dosages were first analysed and then optimized using a two  Cites: Recurrent neural networks for multivariate time series with missing
