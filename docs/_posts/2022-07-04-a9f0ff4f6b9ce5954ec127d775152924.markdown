Flagging the presence of cardiac devices such as pacemakers before an MRI scan is essential to allow appropriate safety checks. We assess the accuracy with which a machine learning model can classify the presence or absence of a pacemaker on pre-existing chest radiographs. A total of 7973 chest radiographs were collected, 3996 with pacemakers visible and 3977 without. Images were identified from information available on the radiology information system (RIS) and correlated with …
