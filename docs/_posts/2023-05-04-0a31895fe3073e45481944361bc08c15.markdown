Labeling up data for classification tasks is a complex process, accompanied by unavoidable errors. Manual or automatic labeling of texts for classification includes systematical errors that can be identified using system approaches based on statistics and machine learning models. It is small data sets that are considered, since the consequences of labeling errors are most noticeable in them. However, in case of small datasets, due to the lack of samples, the problem of sparse distributions …
