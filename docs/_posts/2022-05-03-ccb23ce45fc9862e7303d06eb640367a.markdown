The development of end-to-end models has largely sped up the research in massively multilingual automatic speech recognition (MMASR). Previous research has demonstrated the feasibility to build high quality MMASR models. In this work, we study the impact of adding more languages and propose a lifelong learning approach to build high quality MMASR systems. Experiments on a 66-language Voice Search task show that we can take a model built on 15 languages and Cites: On the opportunities and risks of foundation models
