Metal organic framework (MOF) are widely used in adsorption and separation due to their porous nature, high surface area, structural diversity and lower crystal density. Due to their exceptional thermal and chemical stability, Cu-based MOF are considered excellent hydrogen storage materials in the world of MOFs. Efforts to assess the effectiveness of hydrogen storage in MOFs with molecular simulation and theoretical modeling are crucial in identifying the most promising materials before Cites: Theoretical limits of hydrogen storage in metalorganic
