In this paper, is presented an approach on Feature Engineering for applications on Machine learning in Remote Sensing. Singular Value Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis were applied over a group of bands in order to reduce the amount of data and dimensionality of it. The results provided demonstrate the relevance of Feature Engineering in the field of computer sciences-ML, as it improves drastically the results of a model without changing the parameters of the …
