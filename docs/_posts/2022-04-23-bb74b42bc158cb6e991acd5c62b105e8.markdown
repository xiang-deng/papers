Understanding causality is key to the success of NLP applications, especially in high- stakes domains. Causality comes in various perspectives such as enable and prevent that, despite their importance, have been largely ignored in the literature. This paper introduces a novel fine-grained causal reasoning dataset and presents a series of novel predictive tasks in NLP, such as causality detection, event causality extraction, and Causal QA. Our dataset contains human annotations of 25K cause Cites: Cosmos QA: Machine reading comprehension with contextual
