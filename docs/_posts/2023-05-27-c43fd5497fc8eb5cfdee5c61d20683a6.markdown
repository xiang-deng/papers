Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability on controllable text generation. However, the potential of LLMs in generating text from structured tables remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we study the capabilities of LLMs for table-to-text generation tasks, particularly aiming to investigate their performance in generating natural language statements that can be logically entailed by a provided table. First, we investigate how LLMs compare to state-of-the-art table-to-text fine Cites: Dart: Open-domain structured data record to text generation
