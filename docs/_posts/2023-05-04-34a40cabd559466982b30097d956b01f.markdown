Languages models have been successfully applied to a variety of reasoning tasks in NLP, yet the language models still suffer from compositional generalization. In this paper we present Explainable Verbal Reasoner Plus (EVR+), a reasoning framework that enhances language models compositional reasoning ability by (1) allowing the model to explicitly generate and execute symbolic operators, and (2) allowing the model to decompose a complex task into several simpler ones in a flexible manner  Cites: Self-consistency improves chain of thought reasoning in language
