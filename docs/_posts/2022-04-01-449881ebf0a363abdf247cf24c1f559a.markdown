A fundamental and challenging problem in deep learning is catastrophic forgetting, ie the tendency of neural networks to fail to preserve the knowledge acquired from old tasks when learning new tasks. This problem has been widely investigated in the research community and several Incremental Learning (IL) approaches have been proposed in the past years. While earlier works in computer vision have mostly focused on image classification and object detection, more recently some IL Cites: Contrastive learning of medical visual representations from paired
