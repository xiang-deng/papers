The design of specialized architectures for accelerating the inference procedure of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a booming area of research nowadays. While first-generation rigid accelerator proposals use simple fixed dataflows tailored for dense DNNs, more recent architectures have argued for flexibility to efficiently support a wide variety of layer types, dimensions, and sparsity. As the complexity of these accelerators grows, the analytical models currently being used for design-space …
