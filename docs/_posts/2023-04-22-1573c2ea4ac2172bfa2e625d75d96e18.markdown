In the paradigm of online continual learning, one neural network is exposed to a sequence of tasks, where the data arrive in an online fashion and previously seen data are not accessible. Such online fashion causes insufficient learning and severe forgetting on past tasks issues, preventing a good stability-plasticity trade-off, where ideally the network is expected to have high plasticity to adapt to new tasks well and have the stability to prevent forgetting on old tasks simultaneously. To solve these …
