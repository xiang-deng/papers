The remarkable performance boost of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms is a result of re-emergence of deep neural networks that have been applied in a diverse set of applications. The success of deep learning stems from relaxing the need for the non-trivial task of feature-engineering. However, this remarkable success is conditioned on manually annotating a large amount of data points to generate suitable training datasets to supervise training of these networks. Since manual data annotation is  Cites: Linguistic Knowledge and Transferability of Contextual
