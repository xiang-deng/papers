Traffic prediction methods on a single-source data have achieved excellent results in recent years, especially the Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) based models with spatio-temporal dependency. In reality, various modes of urban transportation operate simultaneously. They influence and complement each other in common space-time occasions, constituting the transportation system dynamically. Thus, traffic data from multiple sources is ostensibly heterogeneous, but internally Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
