The aim of this paper is to investigate the benefit of combining both language and acoustic modelling for speaker diarization. Although conventional systems only use acoustic features, in some scenarios linguistic data contain high discriminative speaker information, even more reliable than the acoustic ones.

The proposed system is based on an iterative algorithm where Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
