Automatically generating human-readable text describing the functionality of a program is the intent of source code summarization. Although Neural Language Models achieve significant performance in this field, an emerging trend is combining neural models with external knowledge. Most previous approaches rely on the sentence-level retrieval and combination paradigm (retrieval of similar code snippets and use of the corresponding code and summary pairs) on the encoder side …
