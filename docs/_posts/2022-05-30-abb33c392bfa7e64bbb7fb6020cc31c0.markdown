Recently, how to handle the situation where only a few samples in the dataset are labeled has become a hot academic topic. Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown its great capacity and potential in this topic. However, existing methods tend to focus more on the relationship between unlabeled samples and labeled samples or focus on unlabeled samples  information while rarely exploring the hidden information between unlabeled data of the same category. To address this  Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
