Data-intensive systems are the backbone of today s computing and are responsible for shaping data centers. Over the years, cloud providers have relied on three principles to maintain cost-effective data systems: use disaggregation to decouple scaling, use domain-specific computing to battle waning laws, and use serverless to lower costs. Although they work well individually, they fail to work in harmony: an issue amplified by emerging data system workloads. In this paper, we envision a Cites: Apiary: A DBMS-Backed Transactional Function-as-a-Service
