We investigate the potential implications of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models and related technologies on the US labor market. Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their correspondence with GPT capabilities, incorporating both human expertise and classifications from GPT-4. Our findings indicate that approximately 80% of the US workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of GPTs, while around 19% of workers may  Cites: On the opportunities and risks of foundation models
