Purpose: Arti cial intelligence and machine learning have led to prominent and spectacular innovations in various scenarios. Application in medicine, however, can be challenging due to privacy concerns and strict legal regulations. Methods that centralize knowledge instead of data could address this issue. Methods: In this work, 6 different decentralized machine learning algorithms are applied to 12-lead ECG classi cation and compared to conventional, centralized machine learning. Results Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
