The paper deals with the problem of controlling the state of industrial devices according to the readings of their sensors. The current methods are based on an approach to feature extraction in which the prediction occurs. We propose an interaction method of multiple blocks of different complexity, which aggregate information differently over time, to create a common latent space for RUL prediction, and train the resulting architecture in a single pass with a new loss function aimed at Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
