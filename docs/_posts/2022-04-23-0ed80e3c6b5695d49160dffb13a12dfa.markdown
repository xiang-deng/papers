Existing Chinese text error detection mainly focuses on spelling and simple grammatical errors. These errors have been studied extensively and are relatively simple for humans. On the contrary, Chinese semantic errors are understudied and more complex that humans cannot easily recognize. The task of this paper is Chinese Semantic Error Recognition (CSER), a binary classification task to determine whether a sentence contains semantic errors.
