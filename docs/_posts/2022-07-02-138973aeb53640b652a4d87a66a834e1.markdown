Text simplification is the task of rewriting a text so that it is readable and easily understood. In this paper, we propose a simple yet novel unsupervised sentence simplification system that harnesses parsing structures together with sentence embeddings to produce linguistically effective simplifications. This means our model is capable of introducing substantial modifications to simplify a sentence while maintaining its original semantics and adequate fluency. We establish the …
