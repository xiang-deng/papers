Deep neural networks are one of the most important methods in machine learning. The advantages of neural networks are their excellent prediction performance and versatility using deep architecture and generalized inputoutput forms. However, as neural networks are black-box models, they lack explanatory power for their predictions. In this study, we propose a new neural network architecture that includes the interpretability of predictions for multivariate time-series (MTS) data by employing Cites: Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate
