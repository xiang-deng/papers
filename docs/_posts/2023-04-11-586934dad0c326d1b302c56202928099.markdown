Commercial search engines use different semantic models to augment lexical matches. These models provide candidate items for a user s query from a target space of millions to billions of items. Models with different inductive biases provide relatively different predictions, making it desirable to launch multiple semantic models in production. However, latency and resource constraints make simultaneously deploying multiple models impractical. In this paper, we introduce a Cites: Latent retrieval for weakly supervised open domain question
