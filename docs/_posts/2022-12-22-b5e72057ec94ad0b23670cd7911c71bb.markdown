Machine learning models can reach high performance on benchmark natural language processing (NLP) datasets but fail in more challenging settings. We study this issue when a pre-trained model learns dataset artifacts in natural language inference (NLI), the topic of studying the logical relationship between a pair of text sequences. We provide a variety of techniques for analyzing and locating dataset artifacts inside the crowdsourced Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) …
