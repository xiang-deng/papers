Eigendecomposition methods have been shown to generate sets of useful options which improve learning speed when used in hierarchical reinforcement learning. However, these methods focus on navigation by learning reward-agnostic representations and struggle when presented with environments with dynamic reward structures, such as adversarial agents. Taking inspiration from mammals, which are known to maintain specialized groupings of cells to perform complex Cites: Explore, discover and learn: Unsupervised discovery of state
