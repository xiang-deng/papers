Unsupervised graph-level representation learning has recently shown great potential in a variety of domains, ranging from bioinformatics to social networks. Plenty of graph contrastive learning methods have been proposed to generate discriminative graph-level representations recently. They typically design multiple types of graph augmentations and enforce a graph to have consistent representations under different views. However, these techniques mostly neglect the intrinsic hierarchical …
