Towards building intelligent dialogue agents, there has been a growing interest in introducing explicit personas in generation models. However, with limited persona- based dialogue data at hand, it may be difficult to train a dialogue generation model well. We point out that the data challenges of this generation task lie in two aspects: first, it is expensive to scale up current persona-based dialogue datasets; second, each data sample in this task is more complex to learn with than conventional Cites: Dialogue natural language inference
