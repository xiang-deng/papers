Conventional domain adaptation methods do not work well when a large gap exists between the source and the target domain. Gradual domain adaptation is one of the approaches to address the problem by leveraging the intermediate domain, which gradually shifts from the source to the target domain. The previous work assumed that the number of the intermediate domains is large and the distance of the adjacent domains is small; hence, the gradual domain adaptation algorithm by self-training Cites: Understanding self-training for gradual domain adaptation
