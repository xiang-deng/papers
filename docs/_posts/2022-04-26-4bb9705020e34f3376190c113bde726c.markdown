Huge pretrained language models (LMs) have demonstrated surprisingly good zero- shot capabilities on a wide variety of tasks. This gives rise to the appealing vision of a single, versatile model with a wide range of functionalities across disparate applications. However, current leading techniques for leveraging a frozen LM--ie, leaving its weights untouched--still often underperform fine-tuning approaches which modify these weights in a task-dependent way. Those, in turn, suffer forgetfulness Cites: Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering
