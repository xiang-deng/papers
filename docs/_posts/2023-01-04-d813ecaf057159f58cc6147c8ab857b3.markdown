The dynamic expansion architecture is becoming popular in class incremental learning, mainly due to its advantages in alleviating catastrophic forgetting. However, task confusion is not well assessed within this framework, eg, the discrepancy between classes of different tasks is not well learned (ie, inter-task confusion, ITC), and certain priority is still given to the latest class batch (ie, old-new confusion, ONC). We empirically validate the side effects of the two types of confusion. Meanwhile, a  Cites: Continual learning via neural pruning
