Data-intensive applications do not fully utilize the compute capabilities of Von Neumann architectures because of the memory bandwidth bottleneck. These memory-bandwidth limited applications can be accelerated by minimizing the data movement between the memory and the compute units through in-memory computing (IMC). Using IMC, this work accelerated four different types of applications and algorithms. Cites: Xlnet: Generalized autoregressive pretraining for language
