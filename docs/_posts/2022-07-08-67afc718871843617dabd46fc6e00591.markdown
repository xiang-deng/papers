This paper proposes a class of temporal association rules, denoted by TACOs, for event prediction. As opposed to previous graph rules, TACOs monitor updates to graphs, and can be used to capture temporal interests in recommendation and catch frauds in response to behavior changes, among other things. TACOs are defined on temporal graphs in terms of change patterns and (temporal) conditions, and may carry machine learning (ML) predicates for temporal event prediction. We settle the …
