Background: Temporal distribution shift negatively impacts the performance of clinical prediction models over time. Pretraining foundation models using self- supervised learning on electronic health records (EHR) may be effective in acquiring informative global patterns that can improve the robustness of task-specific models. Objective: To evaluate the utility of EHR foundation models in improving the in- distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance of clinical prediction Cites: On the opportunities and risks of foundation models
