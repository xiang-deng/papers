Automated photo-identification of blue whale individuals has received little attention over the years compared to humpback and right whales, most likely because of the difficulty of the task: blue whales are identified using the low-contrast pigmentation of their skin (light and dark shades of grey displayed in patches of varying sizes). This paper explores the use of three local feature matching techniques (SIFT, L2-Net and LoFTR) for blue whale photo-identification and compares their performance to that of Cites: Removing spurious features can hurt accuracy and affect groups
