Background: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is an important component in Dialogue Systems (DS) which makes the utterances of humans understandable by machines. A central aspect of NLU is intent classification. In intent classification, an NLU receives a user utterance, and outputs a list of N ranked hypotheses (an N-best list) of the predicted intent along with a confidence estimation (a real number between 0 and 1) that is assigned to each hypothesis. Objectives: In this study, we …
