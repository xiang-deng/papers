With collaborative DNN inference, part of queries run on their source edge device to reduce latencies. Because edges show diverse performance and network conditions, different layers should run on different devices, and queries on the datacenter show irregular structures. However, emerging schemes are not able to process such irregular queries. We propose ICE, a collaborative inference service scheme that effectively supports irregular queries. ICE comprises a query slicer, a query manager  Cites: Dynet: The dynamic neural network toolkit
