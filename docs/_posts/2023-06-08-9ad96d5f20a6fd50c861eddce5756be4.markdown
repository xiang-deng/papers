Aspect sentiment classification tasks aim to identify the aspect in a sentence and express the sentiment polarities of the aspect. In existing studies, combining different deep learning models has achieved good results in aspectual sentiment classification tasks; however, problems such as complex syntactic parsing relationships, insensitivity to syntactic structure information and lack of exploitation of external sentiment knowledge. We propose a graph attention network (SSK-GAT)  Cites: Adaptive recursive neural network for target-dependent twitter
