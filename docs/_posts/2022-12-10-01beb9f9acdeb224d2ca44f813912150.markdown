As an important research work in knowledge fusion, entity alignment can promote the sharing and integration of multi-source knowledge graphs. Recently, entity alignment based on graph neural networks has received a lot of attention for its ability to capture the topology of entities, but it ignores the noise in neighbor subgraphs and the impact of distant neighbors on central entities. In addition, the knowledge graph is a sparse structure, with the vast majority of entities obeying the long-tail effect. But Cites: Exploring and Evaluating Attributes, Values, and Structures for
