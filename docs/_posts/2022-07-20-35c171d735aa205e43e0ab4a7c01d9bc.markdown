Abstract Representation learning of knowledge graphs is the task of representing entities and relations of real-world knowledge as low-dimensional vectors. Some previous works have demonstrated that entity types are beneficial for knowledge representation, but these methods rely too much on prior knowledge or do not have pluggability. To address these limitations, we propose a new method named TRPE which can better explore the entity type information for knowledge graph embedding  Cites: Representation Learning of Knowledge Graphs with Hierarchical
