The present paper aims to propose a new learning and interpretation method called “impartial competitive learning”, meaning that all participants in a competition should be winners. Due to its importance, the impartiality is forced to be realised even by increasing the corresponding cost in terms of the strength of weights. For the first approximation, three types of impartial competition can be developed: componential, computational, and collective competition. In the componential competition, every …
