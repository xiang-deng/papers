GPT-3 models are very powerful, achieving high performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks. However, there is a relative lack of detailed published analysis on how well they perform on the task of grammatical error correction (GEC). To address this, we perform experiments testing the capabilities of a GPT-3 model (text-davinci-003) against major GEC benchmarks, comparing the performance of several different prompts, including a comparison of zero-shot and few-shot settings  Cites: How can we know what language models know?
