Abstract Applying Transfer-Learning based on pre-trained language models has become popular in Natural Language Processing. In this paper, we present a weakly supervised Named Entity Recognition system that uses a pre-trained BERT model and applies two consecutive fine tuning steps. We aim to reduce the amount of human labour required for annotating data by proposing a framework which starts by creating a data set that uses lexicons and pattern recognition on documents. This first …
