Few-shot dense retrieval (DR) aims to effectively generalize to novel search scenarios by learning a few samples. Despite its importance, there is little study on specialized datasets and standardized evaluation protocols. As a result, current methods often resort to random sampling from supervised datasets to create few-data setups and employ inconsistent training strategies during evaluations, which poses a challenge in accurately comparing recent progress.
