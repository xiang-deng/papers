Text structuralization is one of the important fields of natural language processing (NLP) consists of information extraction (IE) and structure formalization. However, current studies of text structuralization suffer from a shortage of manually annotated high-quality datasets from different domains and languages, which require specialized professional knowledge. In addition, most IE methods are designed for a specific type of structured data, eg, entities, relations, and events, making them hard  Cites: Rethinking the Role of Demonstrations: What Makes In-Context
