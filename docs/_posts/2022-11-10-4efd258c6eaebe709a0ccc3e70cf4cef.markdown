We present a dataset generator engine named Web-based Visual Corpus Builder (Webvicob). Webvicob can readily construct a large-scale visual corpus (ie, images with text annotations) from a raw Wikipedia HTML dump. In this report, we validate that Webvicob-generated data can cover a wide range of context and knowledge and helps practitioners to build a powerful Visual Document Understanding (VDU) backbone. The proposed engine is publicly available at https://github. com/clovaai  Cites: Pix2Struct: Screenshot Parsing as Pretraining for Visual Language
