As a widely used semi-supervised learning strategy, self-training generates pseudo-labels to alleviate the labor-intensive and time-consuming annotation problems in crowd counting while boosting the model performance with limited labeled data and massive unlabeled data. However, the noise in the pseudo-labels of the density maps greatly hinders the performance of semi-supervised crowd counting. Although auxiliary tasks, eg, binary segmentation, are utilized to help improve the feature Cites: Rethinking pre-training and self-training
