Abstract Understanding how a Machine Learning (ML) model makes decisions is essential for successful model development and deployment. With the increased need to model transparency and intelligibility, rule sets are often used to communicate the model logic. In my research, we identified three challenges of applying rules in a practical setting for model understanding. First, there is a lack of systematic study of how the visualization of rules influences rule understanding …
