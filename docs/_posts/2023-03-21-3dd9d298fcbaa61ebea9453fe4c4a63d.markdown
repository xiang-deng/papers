The detection of exoplanets with the radial velocity method consists in detecting variations of the stellar velocity caused by an unseen sub-stellar companion. Instrumental errors, irregular time sampling, and different noise sources originating in the intrinsic variability of the star can hinder the interpretation of the data, and even lead to spurious detections. In recent times, work began to emerge in the field of extrasolar planets that use Machine Learning algorithms, some with results that Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
