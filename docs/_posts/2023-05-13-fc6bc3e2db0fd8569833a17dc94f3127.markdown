In everyday life, humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of goal-oriented scripts. Previous work has exploited language models (LMs) to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities (eg,  make a cake ), but leaves more specific goals with multi-facet constraints understudied (eg,  make a cake for diabetics ). In this paper, we define the task of constrained language planning for the first time. We propose an overgenerate-then …
