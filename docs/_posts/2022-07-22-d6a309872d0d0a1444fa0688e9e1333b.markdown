Handling various robot action-language translation tasks flexibly is an essential requirement for natural interaction between a robot and a human. Previous approaches require change in the configuration of the model architecture per task during inference, which undermines the premise of multi-task learning. In this work, we propose the paired gated autoencoders (PGAE) for flexible translation between robot actions and language descriptions in a tabletop object manipulation scenario Cites: Crossmodal language grounding in an embodied neurocognitive
