Visual recognition is recently learned via either supervised learning on human- annotated image-label data or language-image contrastive learning with webly- crawled image-text pairs. While supervised learning may result in a more discriminative representation, language-image pretraining shows unprecedented zero-shot recognition capability, largely due to the different properties of data sources and learning objectives. In this work, we introduce a new formulation by Cites: Contrastive learning of medical visual representations from paired
