Event relation extraction is a fundamental task in text mining, which has wide applications in event-centric natural language processing. However, most of the existing approaches can hardly model complicated contexts since they fail to use dependency-type knowledge in texts to assist in identifying implicit clues to event relations, leading to the sub-optimal performance on this task. To this end, we propose a novel type-guided attentive graph convolutional network for event relation Cites: Joint constrained learning for event-event relation extraction
