This paper presents an advanced offline scheduling scheme to improve the accelerator efficiency, especially for the highly-pruned convolutional neural networks (HP-CNNs). Based on the existing outlier-aware accelerator design, we demonstrate the efficiency drop of HP-CNN processing for the first time, and element-wise channel merging is proposed to make a dense processing sequence even for the highly-pruned model. The dedicated hardware architecture is also presented to … Cites: ‪Coatnet: Marrying convolution and attention for all data sizes‬
