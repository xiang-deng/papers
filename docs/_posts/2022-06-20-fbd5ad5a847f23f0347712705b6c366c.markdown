Region dropout regularization strategies have proven to be highly effective at improving the generalization performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a variety of computer vision tasks including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation because these strategies enable models to focus on a wider range of image region information. However, for action recognition, models need to be able to extract not only useful spatial information but also important …
