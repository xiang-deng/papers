When humans interact with robots influence is inevitable. Consider an autonomous car driving near a human: the speed and steering of the autonomous car will affect how the human drives. Prior works have developed frameworks that enable robots to influence humans towards desired behaviors. But while these approaches are effective in the short-term (ie, the first few human-robot interactions), here we explore long-term influence (ie, repeated interactions between the same human and robot)  Cites: Legibility and predictability of robot motion
