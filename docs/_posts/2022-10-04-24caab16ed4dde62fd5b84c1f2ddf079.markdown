A semantic extension-based classification algorithm for short texts, ie, Set-CNN, is proposed in this paper. The proposed Set-CNN features three aspects. First, a semantic extension mechanism based on the fast clustering algorithm is applied to enrich the features of short texts. Second, a multiple-channel convolutional framework is proposed to capture semantic features at different levels. More specifically, both ordinary 1 D convolution and atrous convolution are performed on …
