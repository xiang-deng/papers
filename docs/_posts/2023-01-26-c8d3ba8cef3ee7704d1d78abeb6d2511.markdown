Knowledge tracing, the goal of which is predicting students future performance given their past question response sequences to trace their knowledge states, is pivotal for computer-aided education and intelligent tutoring systems. Although many technical efforts have been devoted to modeling students based on their question-response sequences, fine-grained interaction modeling between question-response pairs within each sequence is underexplored. This causes question-response  Cites: What does BERT look at? An analysis of BERT s attention
