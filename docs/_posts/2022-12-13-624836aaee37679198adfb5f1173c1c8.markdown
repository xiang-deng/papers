Answering complex questions that require making latent decisions is a challenging task, especially when limited supervision is available. Recent works leverage the capabilities of large language models (LMs) to perform complex question answering in a few-shot setting by demonstrating how to output intermediate rationalizations while solving the complex question in a single pass. We introduce``Successive Prompting , where we iteratively break down a complex task into a simple task, solve Cites: Giving BERT a Calculator: Finding Operations and Arguments with
