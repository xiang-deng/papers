Cross-modal hashing has attracted a great deal of attention due to its unique low storage cost and high retrieval efficiency. However, these existing cross-modal retrieval methods fail to deal with global semantic relational redundancy, leading to an unsatisfactory performance on such data. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a novel cross-modal hashing, namely Relation-guided Dual Hash Network (RDHN) for unsupervised cross-modal retrieval. It captures both long-range  Cites: Interactive Attention Model Explorer for Natural Language
