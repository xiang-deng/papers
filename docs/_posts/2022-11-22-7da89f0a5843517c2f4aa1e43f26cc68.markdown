Mental models are an inherently incomplete representation of any system, but numerous factors make it especially challenging to develop adequate mental models of AI systems. First, modern AI systems are often black-box models for which humans cannot see how or why the model made a prediction [54]. Second, black-box models are also often stochastic and can provide different outputs for slightly different inputs without human-understandable reasons [1]. Lastly, people often expect AI models to Cites: What Did My AI Learn? How Data Scientists Make Sense of Model
