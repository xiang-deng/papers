This paper studies graph-structured prediction for supervised learning on graphs with node-wise or edge-wise target dependencies. To solve this problem, recent works investigated combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with conventional structured prediction algorithms like conditional random fields. However, in this work, we pursue an alternative direction building on the recent successes of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). That is, we propose a new framework using DPMs to …
