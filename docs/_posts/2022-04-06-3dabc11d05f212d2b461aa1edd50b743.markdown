Open access to datasets is increasingly driving modern science. Consequently, discovering such datasets is becoming an important functionality for scientists in many different fields. We investigate methods for dataset recommendation: the task of recommending relevant datasets given a dataset that is already known to be relevant. Previous work has used meta-data descriptions of datasets and interest profiles of authors to support dataset recommendation. In this work, we are the first to Cites: Complex embeddings for simple link prediction
