Abstract The Answer Sentence Selection (AS2) task is defined as the task of ranking the candidate answers for each question based on a matching score. The matching score is the probability of being a correct answer for a given question. Detecting the question class and matching it with the named entities of the answer sentence to narrow down the search space was used in primary question answering systems. We used this idea in the state-of-the-art text matching models namely, Transformer Cites: Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research
