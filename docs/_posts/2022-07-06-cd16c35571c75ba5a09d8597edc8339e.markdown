The pervasiveness of cardiovascular disease and physician misdiagnosis creates the urgent need for artificial intelligence models to improve diagnosis accuracy. The first objective of this study was to train machine learning models on publicly available data sets containing simple medical information of patients to diagnose cardiovascular disease. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) assembled for this task performed optimally with an F1 score of 0.8968. This prompted the creation of an …
