Compressing posting lists in large-scale search engines for efficiency improvement conventionally involves encoding document identifiers and term frequencies separately. In this work, we adopt dense unary codes in favor of joint encoding and evaluate them in terms of compression ratio along with two other techniques on eight document collections having different characteristics as to term frequency distribution. As a result, it has been observed that dense unary codes yield higher …
