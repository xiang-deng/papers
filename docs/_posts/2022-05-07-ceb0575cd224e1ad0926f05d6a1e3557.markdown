Machine reading comprehension (MRC) that requires discrete reasoning involving symbolic operations, eg, addition, sorting, and counting, is a challenging task. According to this nature, semantic parsing-based methods predict interpretable but complex logical forms. However, logical form generation is nontrivial and even a little perturbation in a logical form will lead to wrong answers. To alleviate this issue, multi- predictor-based methods are proposed to directly predict different types of answers Cites: Giving BERT a Calculator: Finding Operations and Arguments with
