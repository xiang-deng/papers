Reinforcement learning (RL) with sparse and deceptive rewards is a significant challenge because nonzero rewards are rarely obtained, and hence, the gradient calculated by the agent can be stochastic and without valid information. Recent work demonstrates that using memory buffers of previous experiences can lead to a more efficient learning process. However, existing methods usually require these experiences to be successful and may overly exploit them, which can cause the  Cites: Memory augmented policy optimization for program synthesis and
