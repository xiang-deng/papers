Semantic parsing, the task of translating user-issued natural language (NL) utterances (eg, Flights from Pittsburgh to New York) into formal meaning representations (MRs, eg, an SQL database query or a Python program), has become an important direction in developing natural language interfaces to computational systems. Recent years have witnessed the burgeoning of applying neural network-based semantic parsers in various tasks and domains. However Cites: Question Generation from SQL Queries Improves Neural Semantic
