Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to analyze the sentiment polarity of a given text towards several specific aspects. For implementing the ABSA, one way is to convert the original problem into a sentence semantic matching task, using pre-trained language models, such as BERT. However, for such a task, the intra-and inter-semantic relations among input sentence pairs are often not considered. Specifically, the semantic information and guidance of relations revealed in the labels, such as  Cites: RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach
