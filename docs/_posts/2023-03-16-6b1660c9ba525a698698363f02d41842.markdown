The idea of using analogy to assess the quality of word embedding spaces implies the existence of parallelograms between the four terms of an analogy. We investigate the presence of analogy parallelograms in various word embedding spaces for various languages by relying on analogies contained in several analogy test sets. In this paper, we report a negative result: no parallelogram is found. We also discuss another possibility to approach the word as a small n-sphere instead of being a point  Cites: Linguistic regularities in continuous space word representations
