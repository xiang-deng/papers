The cybersecurity report provides unstructured actionable cyber threat intelligence (CTI) with detailed threat attack procedures and indicators of compromise (IOCs), eg, malware hash or URL (uniform resource locator) of command and control server. The actionable CTI, integrated into intrusion detection systems, can not only prioritize the most urgent threats based on the campaign stages of attack vectors (ie, IOCs) but also take appropriate mitigation measures based on contextual information of the Cites: Effective LSTMs for target-dependent sentiment classification
