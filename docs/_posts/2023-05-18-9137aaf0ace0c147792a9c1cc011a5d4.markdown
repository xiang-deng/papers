Recently, neural abstractive text summarization (NATS) models based on sequence-to-sequence architecture have drawn a lot of attention. Real-world texts that need to be summarized range from short news with dozens of words to long reports with thousands of words. However, most existing NATS models are not good at summarizing long documents, due to the inherent limitations of their underlying neural architectures. In this paper, we focus on the task of long document Cites: Text summarization with pretrained encoders
