Artificial intelligence (AI) that utilizes neural networks (NNs) has a broad range of applications. However, NNs necessitate significant amounts of computation and data storage, which imposes considerable hardware demands and drives the need for AI chip research. To address this need, AI chip researchers must delve into extensive literature for entity information on hardware issues, architectures, optimizations, performances, and applications. Nevertheless, the influx of relevant papers has far Cites: Scirex: A challenge dataset for document-level information extraction
