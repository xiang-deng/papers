Large pre-trained language models are well-established for their ability to generate text seemingly indistinguishable from humans. In this work, we study the problem of constrained sampling from such language models. That is, generating text that satisfies user-defined constraints. Typical decoding strategies which generate samples left-to-right are not always conducive to imposing such constraints globally. Instead, we propose MuCoLa--a sampling procedure that combines the log Cites: COLD Decoding: Energy-based Constrained Text Generation with
