Efficient representations of observed input data have been shown to significantly accelerate the performance of subsequent learning tasks in numerous domains. To obtain such representations automatically, we need to design both i) models that identify useful patterns in the input data and encode them into structured low dimensional representations, and ii) evaluation measures that accurately assess the quality of the resulting representations. In this thesis, we present work that addresses  Cites: Spherical latent spaces for stable variational autoencoders
