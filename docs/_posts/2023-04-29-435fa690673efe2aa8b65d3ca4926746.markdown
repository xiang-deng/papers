Automatic grading of computer programs has a great impact on both computer science education and the software industry as it saves human evaluators a tremendous amount of time required for assessing programs. However, to date, this problem lacks extensive research from the machine learning/deep learning perspective. Currently, the existing auto-grading systems are mostly based on test-case execution results. However, these approaches lack insight into the syntax and …
