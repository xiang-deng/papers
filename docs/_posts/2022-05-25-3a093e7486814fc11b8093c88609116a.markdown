Vertical farms are to be considered the future of agriculture given that they not only use space and resources efficiently but can also consistently produce large yields. Recently, artificial intelligence has been introduced for use in vertical farms to boost crop yields, and crop growth monitoring is an essential example of the type of automation necessary to manage a vertical farm system. Region of interest predictions are generally used to find crop regions from the color images captured by Cites: Simple copy-paste is a strong data augmentation method for
