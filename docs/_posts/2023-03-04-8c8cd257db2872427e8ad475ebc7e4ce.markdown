In light of recent advances in adversarial learning, there has been strong and continuing interest in exploring how to perform adversarial learning-to-rank. The previous adversarial ranking methods [eg, IRGAN by Wang et al.(IRGAN: a minimax game for unifying generative and discriminative information retrieval models. Proceedings of the 40th SIGIR pp. 515524, 2017)] mainly follow the generative adversarial networks (GAN) framework (Goodfellow et al. in Generative adversarial Cites: Passage Re-ranking with BERT
