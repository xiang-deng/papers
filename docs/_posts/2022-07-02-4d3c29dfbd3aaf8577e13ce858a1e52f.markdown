The purpose of this thesis is to design MFSE, a meta-fusion model using graph neural networks for combining multi-modal information effectively for the task of polypharmacy side-effect prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first that fuses three important information sources (molecular, target and drug-drug interaction information) depicted as separate graphs, and outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches, reaching an AUROC score of 0.95 and an AUPRC score …
