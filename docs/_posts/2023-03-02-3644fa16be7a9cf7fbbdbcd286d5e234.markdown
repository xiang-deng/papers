In-context learning is a new learning paradigm where a language model observes a few examples and then straightly outputs the test input s prediction. Previous works have shown that in-context learning is sensitive to the provided examples and randomly sampled examples show significantly unstable performance. In this paper, we propose to find``supporting examples  for in-context learning: Given the training dataset, we need to select one permutation of a few examples, which are informative …
