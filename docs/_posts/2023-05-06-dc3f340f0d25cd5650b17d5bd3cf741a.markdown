Extractive summarization aims to form a summary by directly extracting sentences from the source document. Existing works mostly formulate it as a sequence labeling problem by making individual sentence label predictions. This paper proposes DiffuSum, a novel paradigm for extractive summarization, by directly generating the desired summary sentence representations with diffusion models and extracting sentences based on sentence representation matching. In addition, DiffuSum jointly  Cites: Discourse-Aware Neural Extractive Text Summarization
