Question Answering is one of the challenging points of research in natural language processing recently. The problem of automating the answering process for the user s queries became required. So, there were several papers suggested different system architectures for building a question answering systems.

The suggested system architecture is  Cites: Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering
