Unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation aims to obtain a model working well on the unlabeled target domain by reducing the domain gap between the labeled source domains and the unlabeled target domain. Considering the data privacy and storage cost, data from multiple source domains and target domain are isolated and decentralized. This data decentralization scenario brings the difficulty of domain alignment for reducing the domain gap between the decentralized source domains …
