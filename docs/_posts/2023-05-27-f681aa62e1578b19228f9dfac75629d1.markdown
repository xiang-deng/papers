In-context learning (ICL), teaching a large language model (LLM) to perform a task with few-shot demonstrations rather than adjusting the model parameters, has emerged as a strong paradigm for using LLMs. While early studies primarily used a fixed or random set of demonstrations for all test queries, recent research suggests that retrieving semantically similar demonstrations to the input from a pool of available demonstrations results in better performance.
