How to achieve neural machine translation with limited parallel data? Existing techniques often rely on large-scale monolingual corpora, which is impractical for some low-resource languages. In this paper, we turn to connect several low-resource languages to a particular high-resource one by additional visual modality. Specifically, we propose a cross-modal contrastive learning method to learn a shared space for all languages, where both a coarse-grained sentence-level …
