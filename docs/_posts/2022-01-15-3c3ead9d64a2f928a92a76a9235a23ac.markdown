With the widespread of the data resources over the World Wide Web (WWW), there is an overlapping between these resources that contributes to helping researchers in discovering more information and facts. However, extracting information and data and then, calculating the semantic similarity between them is a non-trivial task as such resources have varying ways to describe the information. Thus, such a problem can be overcome by designing a new semantic similarity method which takes into Cites: Semantic parsing for single-relation question answering
