In education applications, knowledge tracing refers to the problem of estimating students time-varying concept/skill mastery level from their past responses to questions and predicting their future performance. One key limitation of most existing knowledge tracing methods is that they treat student responses to questions as binary-valued, ie, whether they are correct or incorrect. Response correctness analysis/prediction ignores important information on student knowledge contained in Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
