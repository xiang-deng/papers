In this paper, we study cross-domain relation extraction. Since new data mapping to feature spaces always differs from the previously seen data due to a domain shift, few-shot relation extraction often perform poorly. To solve the problems caused by cross-domain, we propose a method for combining the pure entity, relation labels and adversarial (PERLA). We first use entities and complete sentences for separate encoding to obtain context-independent entity features. Then, we combine relation  Cites: Learning from Context or Names?
