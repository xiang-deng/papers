Setting proper evaluation objectives for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is vital for making XAI algorithms follow human communication norms, support human reasoning processes, and fulfill human needs for AI explanations. In this article, we examine explanation plausibility, which is the most pervasive human-grounded concept in XAI evaluation. Plausibility measures how reasonable the machine explanation is compared to the human explanation. Plausibility has been Cites: Does the Whole Exceed its Parts? The Effect of AI Explanations on
