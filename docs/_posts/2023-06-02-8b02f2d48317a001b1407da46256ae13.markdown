Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are developing rapidly and gaining widespread adoption, which furthers the acute need to understand the capabilities and risks associated with AI. To better address this broad issue, we focus on AI Safety through two lenses:(1) model trojaning and (2) model benchmarking. Concretely, we provide three valuable contributions that push the forefront of AI safety: evasive trojan injection in AI systems that are harder to detect and reverse-engineer, the MATH …
