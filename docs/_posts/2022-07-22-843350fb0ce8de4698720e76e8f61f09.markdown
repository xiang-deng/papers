With the emergence of Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and the success of large-scale PLMs such as BERT and GPT, the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has achieved tremendous development. Therefore, nowadays, PLMs have become an indispensable technique for solving problems in NLP. In this paper, we survey PLMs to help researchers quickly understand various PLMs and determine the appropriate ones for their specific NLP projects. Specifically, first, we brief on the Cites: Pre-Trained Models: Past, Present and Future
