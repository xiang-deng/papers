Neural machine translation (MT) systems have been shown to perform poorly on low-resource language pairs, for which large-scale parallel data is unavailable. Making the data annotation process faster and cheaper is therefore important to ensure equitable access to MT systems. To make optimal use of a limited annotation budget, we present CHIA (choosing instances to annotate), a method for selecting instances to annotate for machine translation. Using an existing multi-way parallel dataset of Cites: Practical Comparable Data Collection for Low-Resource
