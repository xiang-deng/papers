Pommerman is a hybrid cooperative/adversarial multi-agent environment, with challenging characteristics in terms of partial observability, limited or no communication, sparse and delayed rewards, and restrictive inference time limits. This makes it a challenging environment for reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. In this paper, we focus on developing a curriculum for learning a robust and promising policy in a constrained computational budget of 100,000 games, starting Cites: Query-Efficient Imitation Learning for End-to-End Autonomous
