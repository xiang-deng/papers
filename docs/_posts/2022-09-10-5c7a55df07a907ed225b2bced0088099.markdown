To analyse data, a computationally feasible pipeline must be developed for data modelling. Corpora properties affect performance variability of machine learning (ML) techniques in pipelines; however, this has not been thoroughly investigated using simulation methodologies. A Monte Carlo study is used to compare differences in the area under the curve (AUC) metric for large-n-small-p-corpora examining: 1) the choice of ML algorithm; 2) size of the training database; 3) measurement error; 4) Cites: The unreasonable effectiveness of data
