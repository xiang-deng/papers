Graph convolutional networks have been successfully applied to aspect-based sentiment analysis, due to their ability to flexibly capture syntactic information and word dependencies. However, most existing graph network-based models only consider the syntactic dependencies between specific aspects and contexts. These cannot capture the internal semantic correlations within aspect-specific phrases and ignore the sentiment interaction relations between different aspects of a sentence.
