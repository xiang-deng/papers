In this paper, we define a neuro-symbolic approach to address the task of finding semantically similar clones for the codes of the legacy programming language COBOL, without training data. We define a meta-model that is instantiated to have an Intermediate Representation (IR) in the form of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) common across codes in C and COBOL. We linearize the IRs using Structure Based Traversal (SBT) to create sequential inputs. We further fine-tune UnixCoder, the best Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
