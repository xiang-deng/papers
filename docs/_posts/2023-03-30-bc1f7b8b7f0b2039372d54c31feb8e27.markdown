Extractive Question Answering, also known as machine reading comprehension, can be used to evaluate how well a computer comprehends human language. It is a valuable topic with many applications, such as in chatbots and personal assistants. End-to-end neural-network-based models have achieved remarkable performance on these tasks. The most frequently used approach to extract answers with neural networks is to predict the answer s start and end positions in the document …
