Recently, the practical deployment of open-domain dialogue systems has been plagued by the knowledge issue of information deficiency and factual inaccuracy. To this end, we introduce PLATO-K based on two-stage dialogic learning to strengthen internal knowledge memorization and external knowledge exploitation. In the first stage, PLATO-K learns through massive dialogue corpora and memorizes essential knowledge into model parameters. In the second stage, PLATO-K mimics human Cites: Few-shot learning with retrieval augmented language models
