This research develops learning representations and architectures for natural language understanding, within an information mining framework for analysis of open-source cyber threat intelligence (CTI). Both contextual (sequential) and topological (graph-based) encodings of short text documents are modeled. To accomplish this goal, a series of machine learning tasks are defined, and learning representations are developed to detect crucial information in these documents …
