On-device deep neural network (DNN) training holds the potential to enable a rich set of privacy-aware and infrastructure-independent personalized mobile applications. However, despite advancements in mobile hardware, locally training a complex DNN is still a nontrivial task given its resource demands. In this work, we show that the limited memory resources on mobile devices are the main constraint and propose Sage as a framework for efficiently optimizing memory resources for on …
