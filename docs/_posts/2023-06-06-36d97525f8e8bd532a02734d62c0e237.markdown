Given the rapid ascent of large language models (LLMs), we study the question:(How) can large language models help in reviewing of scientific papers or proposals? We first conduct some pilot studies where we find that (i) GPT-4 outperforms other LLMs (Bard, Vicuna, Koala, Alpaca, LLaMa, Dolly, OpenAssistant, StableLM), and (ii) prompting with a specific question (eg, to identify errors) outperforms prompting to simply write a review. With these insights, we study the use  Cites: Palm 2 technical report
