Abstract Knowledge graphs have been constructed to represent real-world knowledge. However, downstream tasks usually suffer from the incompleteness of the knowledge graphs. To predict the missing links, various models have been proposed by embedding the entities and relations into lower-dimensional spaces. Existing approaches usually ignore the fact that there are much fewer relations than entities and allow redundant parameters for relations. In this paper, we present  Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
