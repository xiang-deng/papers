Abstract Knowledge graphs can provide a rich resource for constructing question answering systems and recommendation systems. However, most knowledge graphs still encounter knowledge incompleteness. The path-based approach predicts the unknown relation between pairwise entities based on existing path facts. This approach is one of the most promising approaches for knowledge graph completion. A critical challenge of such approaches is integrating path sequence  Cites: Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text
