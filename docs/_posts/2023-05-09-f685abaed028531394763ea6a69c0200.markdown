We introduce three simple randomized variants of byte pair encoding (BPE) and explore whether randomizing the selection of merge operations substantially affects a downstream machine translation task. We focus on translation into morphologically rich languages, hypothesizing that this task may show sensitivity to the method of choosing subwords. Analysis using a Bayesian linear model indicates that two of the variants perform nearly indistinguishably compared to standard BPE while the other  Cites: Fast wordpiece tokenization
