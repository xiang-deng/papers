High-capacity deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) often suffer from poor worst-group accuracy despite good on-average performance, where worst-group accuracy measures a model s robustness towards certain subpopulations of the input space. Spurious correlations and memorization behaviors of ERM trained DNNs are typically attributed to this degradation in performance. We develop a method, called CRIS, that address these issues by Cites: Just train twice: Improving group robustness without training group
