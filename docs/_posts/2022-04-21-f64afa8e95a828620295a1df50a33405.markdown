Abstract Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has become a popular field in recent years. The efficiency of the SER system is determined by how much useful information is present in the extracted features. Ongoing research has come close to achieve state-of-the-art results using neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the extracted features. Speech emotion detection deals with the recognition of the speaker s emotion from their speech sample. This detection helps Cites: Regularizing and optimizing LSTM language models
