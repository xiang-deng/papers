Perception of the shapes of deforming objects like wires enables their monitoring and manipulation by autonomous robots. This paper presents detection, classification, and instance segmentation of deformable wires from a cluttered scene in RGBD imagery. This work uses the Detectron2 implementation of Mask R-CNN trained with the PointRend mask head on the UIUCWires dataset as the framework for wire instance segmentation on RGB imagery, a method demonstrated to perform  Cites: Simple copy-paste is a strong data augmentation method for
