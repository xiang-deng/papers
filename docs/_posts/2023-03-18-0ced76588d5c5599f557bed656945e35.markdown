We analyze transformers from the perspective of iterative inference, seeking to understand how model predictions are refined layer by layer. To do so, we train an affine probe for each block in a frozen pretrained model, making it possible to decode every hidden state into a distribution over the vocabulary. Our method, the\emph {tuned lens}, is a refinement of the earlier``logit lens technique, which yielded useful insights but is often brittle. We test our method on various Cites: Realtoxicityprompts: Evaluating neural toxic degeneration in
