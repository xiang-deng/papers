Abstract Machine learning algorithms are widely applied to create powerful prediction models. With increasingly complex models, humans  ability to understand the decision function (that maps from a high‐dimensional input space) is quickly exceeded. To explain a model s decisions, black‐box methods have been proposed that provide either non‐linear maps of the global topology of the decision boundary, or samples that allow approximating it locally. The former loses information about …
