Undoubtedly hydrocyclones play a critical role in powder technology, which can considerably affect the plants process efficiency. However, hydrocyclones were rarely modeled on an industrial scale, where a model can be used to train operators and minimize potential scale-up errors and lab costs. The novel approach for filling such a gap would be using conscious lab CL as a new concept that builds based on an industrial dataset and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).
