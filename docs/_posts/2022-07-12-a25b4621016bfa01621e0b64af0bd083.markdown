Mathematical reasoning is one of the most impressive achievements of human intellect but remains a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence systems. In this work we explore whether modern deep learning architectures can learn to solve a symbolic addition task by discovering effective arithmetic procedures. Although the problem might seem trivial at first glance, generalizing arithmetic knowledge to operations involving a higher number of terms, possibly composed by longer …
