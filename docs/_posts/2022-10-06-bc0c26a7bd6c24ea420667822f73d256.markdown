Aspect-based sentiment analysis assists service providers to better understand users opinions expressed in massive amounts of online posts, because it automatically infers users sentiments towards the aspect terms of interest. Recently, several researchers have attempted to apply first-order logic (FOL) rules to deep neural networks via the posterior constraint method. However, existing methods simply apply a priori constraints to represent the FOL with coefficients selected by Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
