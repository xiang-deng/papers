Texts in natural languages are highly repetitive and predictable because of the naturalness of natural languages. Recent research validated that source code in programming languages is also repetitive and predictable, and naturalness is an inherent property of source code. It was also reported that buggy code is significantly less natural than bug-free one, and bug fixing substantially improves the naturalness of the involved source code. In this paper, we revisit the naturalness of buggy code  Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
