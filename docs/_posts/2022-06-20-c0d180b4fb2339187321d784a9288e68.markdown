The wide spread of fake news has caused serious societal issues. We propose a subgraph reasoning paradigm for fake news detection, which provides a crystal type of explainability by revealing which subgraphs of the news propagation network are the most important for news verification, and concurrently improves the generalization and discrimination power of graph-based detection models by removing task-irrelevant information. In particular, we propose a reinforced subgraph Cites: Jingfei Du, Mandar Joshi, Danqi Chen, Omer Levy, Mike Lewis
