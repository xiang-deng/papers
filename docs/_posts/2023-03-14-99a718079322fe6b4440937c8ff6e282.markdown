Textual emotion detection is playing an important role in the human-computer interaction domain. The mainstream methods of textual emotion detection are extracting semantic features and fine-tuning by language models. Due to the information redundancy in semantics, it is difficult for these methods to accurately detect all the emotions implied in the text. The prompting method has been shown to make the language models more purposeful in prediction by filling the cloze or prefix Cites: Cutting down on prompts and parameters: Simple few-shot
