Entity Linking (EL) aims to map mentions in a text to corresponding entities in a knowledge base. Existing EL methods usually rely on sufficient labeled data to achieve the best performance. However, the massive investment in data makes EL systems viable only to a limited audience. There is ample evidence that introducing entity types can provide the model prior knowledge to maintain the model performance in low-data regimes. Unfortunately, current low-data EL methods Cites: Autoregressive entity retrieval
