Conventional NAS-based pruning algorithms aim to find the sub-network with the best validation performance. However, validation performance does not successfully represent test performance, ie, potential performance. Also, although fine-tuning the pruned network to restore the performance drop is an inevitable process, few studies have handled this issue. This paper provides a novel Ensemble Knowledge Guidance (EKG) to solve both problems at once. First, we experimentally prove that …
