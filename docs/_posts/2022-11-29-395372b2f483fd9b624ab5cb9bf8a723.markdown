As a challenging sub-task of event argument extraction, implicit event argument extraction seeks to identify document-level arguments that play direct or implicit roles in a given event. Prior work mainly focuses on capturing direct relations between arguments and the event trigger; however, the lack of reasoning ability imposes limitations to the extraction of implicit arguments. In this work, we propose an A rgument-argument R elation-enhanced E vent A rgument extraction (AREA) learning Cites: Detecting formal thought disorder by deep contextualized word
