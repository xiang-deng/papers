A novel text summarization framework referred to as Skip-Though Vector and Bi- encoder Based Automatic Text Summarization (STVBEATS) is proposed in this paper. STVBEATS utilizes(a) skip-though vector to generate sentence-based embedding; and (b) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based deep autoencoder to reduce dimensions of skip thought vectors. STVBEATS works in the conjunction of extractive and abstractive summarization models to enhance the overall quality of the Cites: Get to the point: Summarization with pointer-generator networks
