The feature representation of wind power sequences is crucial in the modeling of short-tern wind power forecast, but the existing feature representation methods mostly depend on the end-to-end model based on supervised learning, ignoring the superiority of self-supervised learning in the feature distribution of similar and non-similar sequences in the feature space. Therefore, this paper applies contrastive learning that is a type of self-supervised learning for the feature representation of Cites: SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings
