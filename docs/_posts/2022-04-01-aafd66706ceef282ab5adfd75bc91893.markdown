Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which mimics human visual perception mechanism, has been successfully used in many computer vision areas. Some psychophysical studies show that the visual perception mechanism synchronously processes the form, color, movement, depth, etc., in the initial stage [7, 20] and then integrates all information for final recognition [38]. What s more, the human visual system [20] contains different subdivisions or different tasks. Inspired by the above Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
