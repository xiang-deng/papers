The present paper addresses the study of non‐arbitrariness in language within a deep learning framework. We present a set of experiments aimed at assessing the pervasiveness of different forms of non‐arbitrary phonological patterns across a set of typologically distant languages. Different sequence‐processing neural networks are trained in a set of languages to associate the phonetic vectorization of a set of words to their sensory (Experiment 1), semantic (Experiment 2), and word‐class …
