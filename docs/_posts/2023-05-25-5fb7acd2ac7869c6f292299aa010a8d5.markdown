Recent language models have made tremendous progress in the structured data to text generation task. However, these models still give sub-optimal performance where logical inference is required to generate the descriptions. In this work, we specifically focus on analytical text generation from structured data such as tables. Building on the taxonomy proposed in (Gupta et al., 2020) we focus on controllable table to text generation for the following reasoning categories: numerical reasoning  Cites: TaBERT: Pretraining for Joint Understanding of Textual and
