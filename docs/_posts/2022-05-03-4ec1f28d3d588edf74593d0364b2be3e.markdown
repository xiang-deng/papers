For task-oriented dialogue systems, Natural Language Generation (NLG) is the last and vital step which aims at generating an appropriate response according to the dialogue act (DA). While end-to-end neural networks have achieved promising performances on this task, the existing models still struggle to avoid slot mistakes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel segmented generation approach in this paper. The proposed method operates by progressively generating text for the span Cites: Transferable multi-domain state generator for task-oriented
