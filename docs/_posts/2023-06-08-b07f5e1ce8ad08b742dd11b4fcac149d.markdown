Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrated effective for code generation. Due to the complexity and opacity of LLMs, little is known about how these models generate code. To deepen our understanding, we investigate whether LLMs attend to the same parts of a natural language description as human programmers during code generation. An analysis of five LLMs on a popular benchmark, HumanEval, revealed a consistent misalignment between LLMs and Cites: A Systematic Evaluation of Large Language Models of Code
