Causal correlation data over the equipment spot-inspection operation and maintenance (O&M) records and fault investigation sheets potentially reflect the state related to the causal effect of equipment failures. Various factors influence equipment failures, making it difficult to effectively analyze the main cause of the problems. Mining and leveraging these causal data from the equipment spot inspection records will undoubtedly significantly improve the root cause analysis of the fault in the O&M  Cites: ERNIE: Enhanced Language Representation with Informative
