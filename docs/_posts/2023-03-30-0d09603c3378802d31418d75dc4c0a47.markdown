Frame semantics-based approaches have been widely used in semantic parsing tasks and have become mainstream. It remains challenging to disambiguate frame representations evoked by target lexical units under different contexts. Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have been used in semantic parsing and significantly improve the accuracy of neural parsers. However, the PLMs-based approaches tend to favor collocated patterns presented in the training data, leading to inaccurate Cites: Using semantic roles to improve question answering
