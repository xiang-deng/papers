Automatic CT segmentation of proximal femur has a great potential for use in orthopedic diseases, especially in the imaging-based assessments of hip fracture risk. In this study, we proposed an approach based on deep learning for the fast and automatic extraction of the periosteal and endosteal contours of proximal femur in order to differentiate cortical and trabecular bone compartments. A three-dimensional (3D) end-to-end fully convolutional neural network (CNN), which can better combine Cites: Segmentation of the proximal femur from MR images using deep
