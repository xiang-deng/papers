A common model used in addressing today s overwhelming amounts of data is the OLAP Cube. The OLAP community has proposed several cube algebras, although a standard has still not been nominated. This study focuses on a recent addition to the cube algebras: the user-centric Cube Algebra Query Language (CAQL). The study aims to explore the optimization potential of this algebra by applying logical rewriting inspired by classic relational algebra and parallelism. The lack of standard algebra is Cites: Answering queries using views
