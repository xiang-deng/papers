The immense amounts of source code provide ample challenges and opportunities during software development. To handle the size of code bases, developers commonly search for code, eg, when trying to find where a particular feature is implemented or when looking for code examples to reuse. To support developers in finding relevant code, various code search engines have been proposed. This article surveys 30 years of research on code search, giving a comprehensive overview of Cites: Cosqa: 20,000+ web queries for code search and question
