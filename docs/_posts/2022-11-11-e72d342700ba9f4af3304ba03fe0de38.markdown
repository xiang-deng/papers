Summarizing novel chapters is a difficult task due to the input length and the fact that sentences that appear in the desired summaries draw content from multiple places throughout the chapter. We present a pipelined extractive-abstractive approach where the extractive step filters the content that is passed to the abstractive component. Extremely lengthy input also results in a highly skewed dataset towards negative instances for extractive summarization; we thus adopt a margin ranking loss  Cites: Crowdsourcing Lightweight Pyramids for Manual Summary
