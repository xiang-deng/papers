Contrastive learning (CL) has shown its power in recommendation. However, most CL-based recommendation models build their CL tasks merely focusing on the user s aspects, ignoring the rich diverse information in items. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-granularity item-based contrastive learning (MicRec) framework for the matching stage (ie, candidate generation) in recommendation, which systematically introduces multi-aspect item-related information to representation learning with CL  Cites: Knowledge transfer via pre-training for recommendation: A review
