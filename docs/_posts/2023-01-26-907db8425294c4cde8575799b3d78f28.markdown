Understanding user interface (UI) functionality is a useful yet challenging task for both machines and people. In this paper, we investigate a machine learning approach for screen correspondence, which allows reasoning about UIs by mapping their elements onto previously encountered examples with known functionality and properties. We describe and implement a model that incorporates element semantics, appearance, and text to support correspondence computation without Cites: Phrase-bert: Improved phrase embeddings from bert with an
