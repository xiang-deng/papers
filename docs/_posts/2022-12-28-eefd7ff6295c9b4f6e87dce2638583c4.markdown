Disjunctive box cluster models summarize-way Boolean tensors with some of their sub-tensors. Mirkin and Kramarenko proposed that regression model, for{2, 3}, and algorithms relying on hill climbing to discover good sub-tensors, according to ordinary least squares. This article generalizes that work to-way fuzzy tensors, details significant performance improvements, better starting points for hill climbing if 3, a greedy ranking of the discovered sub-tensors in descending order of contribution to Cites: Geometric all-way boolean tensor decomposition
