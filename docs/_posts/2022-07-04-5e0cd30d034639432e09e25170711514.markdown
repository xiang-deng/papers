N-ary relational knowledge base (KBs) embedding aims to map binary and beyond-binary facts into low-dimensional vector space simultaneously. Existing approaches typically decompose n-ary relational facts into subtuples (entity pairs, triples or quintuples, etc.), and they generally model n-ary relational KBs in Euclidean space. However, n-ary relational facts are semantically and structurally intact, decomposition leads to the loss of global information and undermines the semantical
