We need billion-scale images to achieve more generalizable and ground-breaking vision models, as well as massive dataset storage to ship the images (eg, the LAION-4B dataset needs 240TB storage space). However, it has become challenging to deal with unlimited dataset storage with limited storage infrastructure. A number of storage-efficient training methods have been proposed to tackle the problem, but they are rarely scalable or suffer from severe damage to performance. In this paper …
