Background: Dental implant failure is a critical condition that can seriously compromise therapeutic efficacy. Insufficient bone volume, unfavorable bone quality, periodontal bone loss, and systemic conditions, including osteopenia/osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus, have been associated with implant failure. Early indicators of potential implant failure could help mitigate the risk of severe complications. This study aimed to develop an effective implant outcome prediction model using dental …
