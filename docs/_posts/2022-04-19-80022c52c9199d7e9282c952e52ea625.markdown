Large NLP models have recently shown impressive performance in language understanding tasks, typically evaluated by fine-tuning tasks. Alternatively, probing has received increasing attention as being a lightweight method for interpreting the intrinsic mechanisms of large NLP models. In probing, post-hoc classifiers are trained on``out-of-domain  datasets that diagnose specific abilities. While probing the language models has led to insightful findings, they appear disjointed from the Cites: Towards a unified view of parameter-efficient transfer learning
