Existing tourism demand forecasting models mainly focus on forecasting demands of relatively long time spans at a single destination. These studies lack considering the evolution of demand patterns or presume fixed interaction structures among multiple destinations, limiting their applications during uncertain times when demands and their interactions could evolve fast. This study simultaneously infers interactions among multiple tourist attractions from tourist arrival data and learns temporal Cites: Empirical evaluation of gated recurrent neural networks on
