In recent years, great progress has been made to incorporate unlabeled data to overcome the inefficiently supervised problem via semi-supervised learning (SSL). Most state-of-the-art models are based on the idea of pursuing consistent model predictions over unlabeled data toward the input noise, which is called consistency regularization. Nonetheless, there is a lack of theoretical insights into the reason behind its success. To bridge the gap between theoretical and practical results, we  Cites: Meta pseudo labels
