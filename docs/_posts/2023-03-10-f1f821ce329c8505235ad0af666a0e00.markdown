As deep learning is pervasive in modern applications, many deep learning frameworks are presented for deep learning practitioners to develop and train DNN models rapidly. Meanwhile, as training large deep learning models becomes a trend in recent years, the training throughput and memory footprint are getting crucial. Accordingly, optimizing training workloads with compiler optimizations is inevitable and getting more and more attentions. However, existing deep learning compilers …
