Information extraction can support novel and effective access paths for digital libraries. Nevertheless, designing reliable extraction workflows can be cost-intensive in practice. On the one hand, suitable extraction methods rely on domain-specific training data. On the other hand, unsupervised and open extraction methods usually produce not-canonicalized extraction results. This paper tackles the question how digital libraries can handle such extractions and if their quality is sufficient in practice Cites: Stanza: A python natural language processing toolkit for many
