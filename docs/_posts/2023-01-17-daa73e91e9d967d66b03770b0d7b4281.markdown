While end-to-end learning systems are rapidly gaining capabilities and popularity, the increasing computational demands for deploying such systems, along with a lack of flexibility, adaptability, explainability, reasoning and verification capabilities, require new types of architectures. Here we introduce a classification of hybrid systems which, based on an analysis of human knowledge and intelligence, combines neural learning with various types of knowledge and knowledge sources Cites: Retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive nlp tasks
