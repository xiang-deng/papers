Facial attractiveness prediction (FAP) aims to assess the facial attractiveness automatically based on human aesthetic perception. Previous methods using deep convolutional neural networks have boosted the performance, but their giant models lead to a deficiency in flexibility. Besides, most of them fail to take full advantage of the dataset. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end FAP approach integrating dual label distribution and lightweight design. To make the best use of the dataset …
