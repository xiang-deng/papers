The extraction and integration of building facade data are necessary for the development of information infrastructure for urban environments. However, existing methods for parsing building facades based on semantic segmentation have difficulties in distinguishing individual instances of connected buildings. Manually collecting and annotating instances of building facades in large datasets is time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the recent development and use of city digital  Cites: Simple copy-paste is a strong data augmentation method for
