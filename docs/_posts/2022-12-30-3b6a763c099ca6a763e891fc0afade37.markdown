The case element is a brief description of the case-related events. Extracting the case elements in the news text has great significance for downstream case field natural language processing tasks. In view of the case field relevance and intrinsic relevance of the case elements, this paper proposes a joint case element extraction method based on case domain correlation and graph convolutional network: modeling sentence contextual information by bi-directional long short-term memory …
