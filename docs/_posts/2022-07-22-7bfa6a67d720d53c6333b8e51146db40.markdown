The current studies of Scene Graph Generation (SGG) focus on solving the long-tailed problem for generating unbiased scene graphs. However, most de-biasing methods overemphasize the tail predicates and underestimate head ones throughout training, thereby wrecking the representation ability of head predicate features. Furthermore, these impaired features from head predicates harm the learning of tail predicates. In fact, the inference of tail predicates heavily depends on Cites: GQA: A new dataset for real-world visual reasoning and
