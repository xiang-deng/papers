The way of obtaining the embeddings of the knowledge graph objects through modeling with binary classification method from the level of triple structure is coarser in granularity for the existing knowledge representation learning models based on the probability, and the space-time efficiency of negative sampling is lower for the most of the knowledge representation learning models at present. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a knowledge representation learning model  Cites: Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text
