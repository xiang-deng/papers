Prediction of the chemical composition and processing history from microstructure morphology can help in material inverse design. In this work, we propose a fused-data deep learning framework that can predict the processing history of a microstructure. We used the Fe-Cr-Co alloys as a model material. The developed framework is able to predict the heat treatment time, temperature, and initial chemical compositions by reading the morphology of Fe distribution and its concentration.
