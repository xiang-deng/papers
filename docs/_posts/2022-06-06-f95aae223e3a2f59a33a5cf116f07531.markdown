Document-level relation extraction aims to infer complex semantic relations among entities in an entire document. Compared with the sentence-level relation extraction, document-level relational facts are expressed by multiple mentions across the sentences in a long-distance, requiring excellent reasoning. In this paper, we propose Dual-Channel and Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Networks (DHGCN), which constructs three graphs in token-level, mention-level, and entity-level to model  Cites: Position-aware Attention and Supervised Data Improve Slot Filling
