Despite the recent success achieved by several two-stage prototypical networks in few-shot named entity recognition (NER) task, the over-detected false spans at span detection stage and the inaccurate and unstable prototypes at type classification stage remain to be challenging problems. In this paper, we propose a novel Type-Aware Decomposed framework, namely TadNER, to solve these problems. We first present a type-aware span filtering strategy to filter out false spans by removing …
