Watermarking has been widely adopted for protecting the intellectual property (IP) of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to defend the unauthorized distribution. Unfortunately, the popular data-poisoning DNN watermarking scheme relies on target model fine-tuning to embed watermarks, which limits its practical applications in tackling real-world tasks. Specifically, the learning of watermarks via tedious model fine-tuning on a poisoned dataset (carefully-crafted sample-label pairs) is not efficient in tackling Cites: Thieves on Sesame Street!
