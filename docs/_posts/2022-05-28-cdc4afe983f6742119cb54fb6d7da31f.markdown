In natural language understanding (NLU) production systems, users  evolving needs necessitate the addition of new features over time, indexed by new symbols added to the meaning representation space. This requires additional training data and results in ever-growing datasets. We present the first systematic investigation into this incremental symbol learning scenario. Our analyses reveal a troubling quirk in building (broad-coverage) NLU systems: as the training dataset grows, more data is … Cites: ‪Examining and Combating Spurious Features under Distribution Shift‬
