Few-shot knowledge graph completion aims to infer unknown triple facts with only a small number of reference triples. Existing methods have shown a strong capability on this problem by combining knowledge representation learning and meta learning. They ignore prior knowledge in the few-shot scenario, while prior knowledge can boost useful information to handle the challenges brought by limited referenced instances. To address the above issue, we propose a few-shot knowledge graph  Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
