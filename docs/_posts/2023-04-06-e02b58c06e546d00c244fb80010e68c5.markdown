Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) predicts relations for entity pairs that rely on long-range context-dependent reasoning in a document. As a typical multi-label classification problem, DocRE faces the challenge of effectively distinguishing a small set of positive relations from the majority of negative ones. This challenge becomes even more difficult to overcome when there exists a significant number of annotation errors in the dataset. In this work, we aim to achieve better integration of  Cites: ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre
