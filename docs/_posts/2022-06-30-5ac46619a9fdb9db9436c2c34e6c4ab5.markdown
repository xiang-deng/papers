Graphs are a very important and common form of data representation, providing information on data entities and their relationships. Deep Learning techniques, and in particular Deep Neural Networks have recently known a great development and have been employed in solving tasks of increasing complexity and variety. Graph Neural Networks are Deep Neural Networks capable of processing graph structured data with minimal loss of information. They have recently known a steady growth …
