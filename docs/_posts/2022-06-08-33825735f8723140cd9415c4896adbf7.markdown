In order for robots to operate effectively in homes and workplaces, they must be able to manipulate the articulated objects common to environments built for and by humans. Previous work learns kinematic models that prescribe this manipulation from visual demonstrations. Lingual signals, such as natural language descriptions and instructions, offer a complementary means of conveying knowledge of such manipulation models and are suitable to a wide range of interactions (eg, remote …
