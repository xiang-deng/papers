Recently, one emerging problem in Named Entity Typing (NET) is the fine-grained classification of task-related entities co-existing with task-unrelated entities. The traditional pipeline framework decomposes this problem into two sub-tasks. The first sub-task filters out the task-unrelated entities, while the second sub-task performs fine-grained classification for task-related entities. In the present study, we have developed an end-to-end neural network to solve the two sub-tasks simultaneously … Cites: ‪Ultra-fine entity typing‬
