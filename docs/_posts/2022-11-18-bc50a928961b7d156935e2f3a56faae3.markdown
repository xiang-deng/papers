A call for deep neural networks (DNN) to permeate all classification problems has found its way to brain computer interface (BCI) applications. Despite this interest, the “depth” of DNNs in this field is a troublesome concept, and it appears uncon-vincing that the available data is being put to effective use. This dissertation centres around these questions by proposing ways to effectively treat the myriad recording contexts that are a necessary aspect of BCI applications. I argue that acknowledging these …
