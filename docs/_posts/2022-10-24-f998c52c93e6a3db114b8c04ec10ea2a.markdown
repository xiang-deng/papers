Multi-hop Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) requires reasoning about multi-hop inference relations between topic entities and answers on the knowledge graph (KG) and returning correct answers. The difficulty of obtaining the implied inference relations in multi-hop questions described in natural language and the sparse knowledge graph bring challenges to the multi-hop KGQA. In this paper, we propose an embedded knowledge graph multi-hop Q&A model based on relational Cites: Semantic Parsing via Staged Query Graph Generation: Question
