Large pre-trained language models for textual data have an unconstrained output space; at each decoding step, they can produce any of 10,000 s of sub-word tokens. When fine-tuned to target constrained formal languages like SQL, these models often generate invalid code, rendering it unusable. We propose PICARD (code and trained
