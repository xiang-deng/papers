This paper explores the integration of symbolic logic knowledge into deep neural networks for learning from noisy crowd labels. We introduce Logic-guided Learning from Noisy Crowd Labels (Logic-LNCL), an EM-alike iterative logic knowledge distillation framework that learns from both noisy labeled data and logic rules of interest. Unlike traditional EM methods, our framework contains a``pseudo-E-step that distills from the logic rules a new type of learning target, which is then used Cites: StructVAE: Tree-structured Latent Variable Models for Semi
