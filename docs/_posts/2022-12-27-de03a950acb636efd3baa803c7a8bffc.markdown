Due to the unstable and complex social network environment, the sole user–item interaction data become insufficient for generating precise recommendations. However, too much emphasis on user–item interactions prevents the discovery of internal connections among them, such as trustworthy user relations. In this work, we have integrated the collaborative and the sequential relations into an end-to-end graph neural network (GNN) simultaneously and proposed a novel framework …
