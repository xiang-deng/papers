Text classification techniques in natural language processing can automatically classify text data in a more efficient way, saving human resources and costs. Therefore, text classification techniques can be applied to the automatic classification of education policy data to quickly locate and accurately find education policy data, thus realising the information management and visual analysis of education policy data. This paper proposes a text classification algorithm based on the attention Cites: Neural summarization by extracting sentences and words
