Data sparseness is expected to negatively impact machine learning (ML) and especially deep learning (DL). In the era of DL, much emphasis is put on learning from large datasets. In cheminformatics, compound classification represents a suitable task for exploring characteristics of ML/DL. Here, we determine minimal data requirements for learning using activity-based compound classification as an exemplary application. Systematic predictions using message-passing neural  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
