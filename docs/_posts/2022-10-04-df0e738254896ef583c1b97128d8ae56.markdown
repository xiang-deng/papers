There are many traditional data models developed for the purpose of storing, managing, and manipulating certain data. However, data comes from different sources which may also include data which is imprecise or inexact. For an application which generates uncertain data, its storage, management, and manipulation becomes equally important as for the certain data. This study presents a relational data model for storing, managing, and manipulating uncertain data with Cites: Representing uncertain data: models, properties, and algorithms
