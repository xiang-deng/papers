As increasingly more software services have been published onto the Internet, it remains a significant challenge to recommend suitable services to facilitate scientific workflow composition. This paper proposes a novel NLP-inspired approach to recommending services throughout a workflow development process, based on incrementally learning latent service representation from workflow provenance. A workflow composition process is formalized as a step-wise, context-aware service … Cites: ‪Representation Learning for the Semantic Web‬
