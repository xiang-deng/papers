Currently, policy instruments are classified mainly by means of manual encoding and checking, which is highly subjective and inefficient, which greatly hinders the development of policy research. The research tries to apply the automatic classification algorithm based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer) to the policy instruments to improve the efficiency and accuracy of policy instruments classification.
