Since math word problem (MWP) solving aims to transform natural language problem description into executable solution equations, an MWP solver needs to not only comprehend the real-world narrative described in the problem text but also identify the relationships among the quantifiers and variables implied in the problem and maps them into a reasonable solution equation logic. Recently, although deep learning models have made great progress in MWPs, they ignore the grounding Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
