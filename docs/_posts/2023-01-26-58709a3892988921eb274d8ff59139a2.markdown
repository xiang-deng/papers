Simulation models start as conceptual models, which list relevant factors and their relationships. In complex socio-environmental problems, these conceptual models are routinely created with participants, via a  participatory modeling approach. Transparency is a tenet of participatory modeling: participants should easily provide their input into the model-building process and see how that input is utilized. Although several elicitation methods are transparent, the resulting conceptual model …
