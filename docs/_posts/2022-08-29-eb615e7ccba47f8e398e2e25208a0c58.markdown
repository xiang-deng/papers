Abstract Conversational Machine Comprehension (CMC) is a challenging task with a broad range of applications in natural language processing. Early approaches deal with CMC in a single-turn setting as traditional MRC. Recent studies have proposed multi-turn models by introducing the information flow mechanism to consider the temporal dependencies among the follow-up questions along with a conversation. However, previous methods merely consider shallow semantic dependencies at the  Cites: QuAC: Question answering in context
