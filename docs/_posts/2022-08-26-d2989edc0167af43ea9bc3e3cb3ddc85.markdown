Rapid development in deep learning model construction has prompted an increased need for appropriate training data. The popularity of large datasets-sometimes known as big data -has diverted attention from assessing their quality. Training on large datasets often requires excessive system resources and an infeasible amount of time. Furthermore, the supervised machine learning process has yet to be fully automated: for supervised learning, large datasets require more time for manually Cites: Dataset cartography: Mapping and diagnosing datasets with
