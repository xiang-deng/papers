Modern supply chains are complex, interconnected systems that contain emergent, invisible dependencies. Lack of visibility often hinders effective risk planning and results in delayed discovery of supply chain problems, with examples ranging from product contamination, unsustainable production practices, or exposure to suppliers clustered in geographical areas prone to natural or man-made disasters. Initiatives that rely on manual collection of data often fail due to supply chain complexity and  Cites: SMORE: Knowledge Graph Completion and Multi-hop Reasoning
