Various studies have been conducted on multi-task learning techniques in natural language understanding (NLU), which build a model capable of processing multiple tasks and providing generalized performance. Most documents written in natural languages contain time-related information. It is essential to recognize such information accurately and utilize it to understand the context and overall content of a document while performing NLU tasks. In this study, we propose a multi-task learning …
