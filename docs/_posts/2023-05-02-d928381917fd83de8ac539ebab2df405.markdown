We describe DiaProlog, a dialogue logic programming language that extends the vanilla Prolog with the features to facilitate the integration of reasoning capabilities into task-oriented dialogue systems. The extended language combines the expressive power of Horn rule and description logic with uncertainty and allows us to describe the specifications for both problem solving and dialogue management in a declarative programming manner. The systems incorporated with DiaProlog are …
