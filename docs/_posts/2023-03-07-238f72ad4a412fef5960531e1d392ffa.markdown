Code Generation aims at generating relevant code fragments according to given natural language descriptions. In the process of software development, there exist a large number of repetitive and low-tech code writing tasks, so code generation has received a lot of attention among academia and industry for assisting developers in coding. In fact, it has also been one of the key concerns in the field of software engineering to make machines understand users requirements and write programs  Cites: Incorporating external knowledge through pre-training for natural
