This paper provides open flight datasets generated by extensive Monte Carlo simulations for an aerodynamically controlled missile under a fixed engagement scenario with the purpose of encouraging data analytics research in the missile application. With the fast advance in the field of data analytics, fueled by the recently developed machine learning and deep learning algorithms, the potential of applying the data analysis techniques to the domain of aerospace engineering is increasingly Cites: BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
