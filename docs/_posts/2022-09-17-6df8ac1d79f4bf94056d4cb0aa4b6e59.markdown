Process monitoring, a typical application of Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT), is crucial to ensure the reliable operation of the industrial system. In practice, due to the harsh environment and unreliable sensors and actuators, it is often difficult for IIoT to collect enough tagged and highly reliable data, which further degrades the process monitoring performance and makes the monitoring results not trustworthy. In order to reduce the negative impact of these unreliable factors, a self-weighted dictionary Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
