Human-robot interaction is limited in large part by the challenge of writing correct specifications for robots. The research community wants alignment between humans  goals and robot behaviors, but this alignment is very hard to achieve. My research tackles this problem. I view alignment as the consequence of iterative design and ample testing, and I design methods in service of these processes. I first study how humans currently write reward functions, and I profile some of the typical errors they …
