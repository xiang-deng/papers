We give an asymptotic expansion of the relative entropy between the heat kernel $ q_Z (t, z, w) $ of a compact Riemannian manifold $ Z $ and the normalized Riemannian volume for small values of $ t $ and for a fixed element $ z\in Z $. We prove that coefficients in the expansion can be expressed as universal polynomials in the components of the curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives at $ z $, when they are expressed in terms of normal coordinates. We describe a method to  Cites: Spherical latent spaces for stable variational autoencoders
