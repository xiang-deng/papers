This chapter studies the KBQA models enhanced with textual data. These models benefit from both KG and text for answering the questions. We have studied the QA models which rely on only text or only KGs as source of knowledge in the previous chapters. Regarding the limitations of the models which only rely on one source of knowledge, we will see how using a combination of text and KG can help the models for leveraging their performance.
