Android developers frequently update source code to improve the performance, security, or maintainability of Android apps. Such Android code updating activities are intuitively repetitive, manual, and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose AutoUpdate, a Transformer-based automated code update recommendation approach for Android Apps, which takes advantage of code abstraction (Abs) and Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) techniques to represent source code. Since this is the first  Cites: Codebleu: a method for automatic evaluation of code synthesis
