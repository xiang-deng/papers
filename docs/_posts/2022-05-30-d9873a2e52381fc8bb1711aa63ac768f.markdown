Abstractive summarization systems based on pretrained language models often generate coherent but factually inconsistent sentences. In this paper, we present a counterfactual data augmentation approach where we augment data with perturbed summaries that increase the training data diversity. Specifically, we present three augmentation approaches based on replacing (i) entities from other and the same category and (ii) nouns with their corresponding WordNet hypernyms. We show that  Cites: Don t give me the details, just the summary! topic-aware
