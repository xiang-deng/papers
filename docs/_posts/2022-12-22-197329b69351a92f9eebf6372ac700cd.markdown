Modeling noise transition matrix is a kind of promising method for learning with label noise. Based on the estimated noise transition matrix and the noisy posterior probabilities, the clean posterior probabilities, which are jointly called Label Distribution (LD) in this paper, can be calculated as the supervision. To reliably estimate the noise transition matrix, some methods assume that anchor points are available during training. Nonetheless, if anchor points are invalid, the noise …
