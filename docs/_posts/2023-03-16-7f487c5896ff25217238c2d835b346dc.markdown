Metaheuristic algorithms are widely-recognized solvers for challenging optimization problems with multi-modality, discretization, large-scale, multi-objectivity, etc. Automatically designing metaheuristic algorithms leverages today s increasing computing resources to conceive, build up, and verify the design choices of algorithms. It requires much less expertise, labor resources, and time cost than the traditional manual design. Furthermore, by fully exploring the design choices with Cites: Symbolic Discovery of Optimization Algorithms
