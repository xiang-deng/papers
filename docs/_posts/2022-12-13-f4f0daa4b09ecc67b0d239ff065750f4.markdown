This study aims at predicting the outcomes of legal cases based on the textual content of judicial decisions. We present a new corpus of Italian documents, consisting of 226 annotated decisions on Value Added Tax by Regional Tax law commissions. We address the task of predicting whether a request is upheld or rejected in the final decision. We employ traditional classifiers and NLP methods to assess which parts of the decision are more informative for the task.
