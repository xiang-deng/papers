Model calibration usually requires optimizing some parameters (eg, temperature) wrt an objective function (eg, negative log-likelihood). In this paper, we report a plain, important but often neglected fact that the objective function is influenced by calibration set difficulty, ie, the ratio of the number of incorrectly classified samples to that of correctly classified samples. If a test set has a drastically different difficulty level from the calibration set, the optimal calibration parameters of the two datasets …
