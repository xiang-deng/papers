We introduce DS-1000, a code generation benchmark with a thousand data science problems spanning seven Python libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas. Compared to prior works, DS-1000 incorporates three core features. First, our problems reflect diverse, realistic, and practical use cases since we collected them from StackOverflow. Second, our automatic evaluation is highly specific (reliable)--across all Codex-002-predicted solutions that our evaluation accept, only 1.8% of them are  Cites: A Systematic Evaluation of Large Language Models of Code
