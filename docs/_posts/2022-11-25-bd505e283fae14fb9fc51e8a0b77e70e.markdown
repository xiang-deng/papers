In this work, we study the importance of content frequency on abstractive summarization, where we define the content as “semantic units.” We propose a two-stage training framework to let the model automatically learn the frequency of each semantic unit in the source text. Our model is trained in an unsupervised manner since the frequency information can be inferred from source text only. During inference, our model identifies sentences with high-frequency semantic units and …
