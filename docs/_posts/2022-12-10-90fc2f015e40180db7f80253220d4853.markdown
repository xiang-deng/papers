Vision models often fail systematically on groups of data that share common semantic characteristics (eg, rare objects or unusual scenes), but identifying these failure modes is a challenge. We introduce AdaVision, an interactive process for testing vision models which helps users identify and fix coherent failure modes. Given a natural language description of a coherent group, AdaVision retrieves relevant images from LAION-5B with CLIP. The user then labels a small amount of  Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
