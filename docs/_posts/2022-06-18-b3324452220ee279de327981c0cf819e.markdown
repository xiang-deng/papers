Organic solar cells (OSCs) have become a potential energy source for indoor light harvesting in recent years as they have witnessed a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 30% under indoor lights. Among various strategies, interlayer engineering is one of the important factors in improving the performance of OSCs. Here, we reported an efficient OSC based on PM6: Y6 photoactive layer showing an excellent PCE of~ 22% and~ 14% under light-emitting diode (LED  Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
