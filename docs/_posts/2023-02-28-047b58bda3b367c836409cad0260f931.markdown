Expert systems for fault diagnosis are computationally expensive to build and maintain, and lack scalability and inherent adaptability to unknown events or modifications in the topology of the monitored system. While data-driven feature selection mechanisms can facilitate diagnosis without the hardship of developing and maintaining expert systems, purely data-driven mechanisms lack understanding of semantic importance within a feature set, and would benefit from additional  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
