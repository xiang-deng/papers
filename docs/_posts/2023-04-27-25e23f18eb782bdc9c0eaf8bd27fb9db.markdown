This paper highlights the importance of personalization in the current state of natural language understanding and generation and introduces the LaMP benchmark--a novel benchmark for training and evaluating language models for producing personalized outputs. LaMP offers a comprehensive evaluation framework with diverse language tasks and multiple entries for each user profile. It consists of seven personalized tasks, spanning three classification and four text generation tasks. We Cites: Unsupervised dense information retrieval with contrastive learning
