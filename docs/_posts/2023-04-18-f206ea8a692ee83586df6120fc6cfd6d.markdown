Aspect-level sentiment analysis is a fine-grained sentiment classification task that aims to identify the sentiment polarity of specific aspects in online reviews. Attention mechanisms and graph convolutional networks have recently been widely used to model associations between aspects and opinion words. However, these methods face challenges in accurately modeling the alignment of aspects and exploiting multiaspect sentiment dependencies due to the limitations of dependency trees and …
