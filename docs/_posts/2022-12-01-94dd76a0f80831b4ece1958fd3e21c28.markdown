Despite remarkable progress in text-to-SQL semantic parsing, the performance of state-of-the-art parsers are still far from perfect. At the same time, modern deep learning based text-to-SQL parsers are often over-confident and thus casting doubt on its trustworthiness when used in an interactive setting. In this paper, we propose to train parser-independent error detectors for text-to-SQL semantic parsers. We test our proposed approach with two parsers, SmBop and Bridge v2, and show our  Cites: Rat-sql: Relation-aware schema encoding and linking for text-to
