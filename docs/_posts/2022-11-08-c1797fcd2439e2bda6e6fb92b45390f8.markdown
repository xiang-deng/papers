Community detection in random graphs or hypergraphs is an interesting fundamental problem in statistics, machine learning and computer vision. When the hypergraphs are generated by a stochastic block model, the existence of a sharp threshold on the model parameters for community detection was conjectured by Angelini et al. 2015. In this paper, we confirm the positive part of the conjecture, the possibility of non-trivial reconstruction above the threshold, for the case of two blocks. We do so by  Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
