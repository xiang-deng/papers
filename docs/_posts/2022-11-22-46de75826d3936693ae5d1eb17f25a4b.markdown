Natural Language-to-Query systems translate a natural language question into a formal query language such as SQL. Typically the translation results in a set of candidate query statements due to the ambiguity of natural language. Hence, an important aspect of NL-to-Query systems is to rank the query statements so that the most relevant query is ranked on top. We propose a novel approach to significantly improve the query ranking and thus the accuracy of such systems. First, we use …
