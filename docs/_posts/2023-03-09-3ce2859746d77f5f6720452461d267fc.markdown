Pipeline parallelism has been demonstrated to be a remarkable approach to improve throughput for training deep neural networks with billions of parameters over heterogeneous clusters. The 1F1B scheduling plan is a widely adopted strategy for memory and performance optimization, which interchanges the forward and backward stage computations of different micro-batches. On the other hand, a common issue in using the 1F1B scheduling is that stage computation is delayed …
