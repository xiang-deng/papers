This assumption can also, at times, be applied to multi-agent games-eg Agent 1 s attraction to green pellets is analogous to Agent 2 s attraction to red pellets. This  analogy  assumption is tied closely to the cognitive process known as empathy. Inspired by empathy, we design a simple and explainable architecture to model another agent s action-value function. This involves learning an  Imagination Network  to transform the other …
