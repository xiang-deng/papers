The success of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) has reshaped the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Yet, it is not easy to obtain high-performing models and deploy them online for industrial practitioners. To bridge this gap, EasyNLP is designed to make it easy to build NLP applications, which supports a comprehensive suite of NLP algorithms. It further features knowledge-enhanced pre- training, knowledge distillation and few-shot learning functionalities for large-scale Cites: Pre-train, prompt, and predict: A systematic survey of prompting
