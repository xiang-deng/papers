Coreference resolution of geological entities is an important task in geological information mining. Although the existing generic coreference resolution models can handle geological texts, a dramatic decline in their performance can occur without sufficient domain knowledge. Due to the high diversity of geological terminology, coreference is intricately governed by the semantic and expressive structure of geological terms. In this paper, a framework CorefRoCNN based on RoBERTa and  Cites: Understanding the value of features for coreference resolution
