Obscuring or otherwise minimizing the release of personality information from potential victims of social engineering attacks effectively interferes with an attacker s personality analysis and reduces the success rate of social engineering attacks. We propose a text transformation method named PerTransGAN using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to protect the personality privacy hidden in text data. Making use of reinforcement learning, we use the output of the discriminator as a Cites: Learning to deceive with attention-based explanations
