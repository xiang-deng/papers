In this dissertation we develop mathematically-principled deep learning algorithms for system identification. Our algorithms are completely data-driven, robust to noise and can be used to solve a variety of real world problems coming from areas such as economics, biology and finance. Governing laws for dynamical systems x (t)= f (t, x (t)) have traditionally been derived from expert knowledge and first principles, however in recent years the large amount of data available resulted in a growing … Cites: ‪Identifying and attacking the saddle point problem in high …‬
