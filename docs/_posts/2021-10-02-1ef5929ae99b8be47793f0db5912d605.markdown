Existing text-to-SQL research only considers complete questions as the input, but lay- users might strive to formulate a complete question. To build a smarter natural language interface to database systems (NLIDB) that also processes incomplete questions, we propose a new task, prefix-to-SQL which takes question prefix from users as the input and predicts the intended SQL. We construct a new benchmark called PAGSAS that contains 124K user question prefixes and the intended SQL for Cites: Rat-sql: Relation-aware schema encoding and linking for text-to
