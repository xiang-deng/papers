Computer programmers frequently use code retrieval systems to reuse existing code snippets from open-source repositories. These systems search a large collection of code snippets to retrieve the most relevant ones based on a text query. However, capturing semantic information between user queries and code snippets presents a key challenge in this task. Previous works have primarily used natural language processing (NLP) approaches to calculate relevance, but these approaches cannot Cites: In-IDE Code Generation from Natural Language: Promise and
