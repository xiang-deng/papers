Constructing useful representations across a large number of tasks is a key requirement for sample-efficient intelligent systems. A traditional idea in multitask learning (MTL) is building a shared representation across tasks which can then be adapted to new tasks by tuning last layers. A desirable refinement of using a shared one-fits-all representation is to construct task-specific representations. To this end, recent PathNet/muNet architectures represent individual tasks as pathways within a  Cites: Attentional mixtures of soft prompt tuning for parameter-efficient
