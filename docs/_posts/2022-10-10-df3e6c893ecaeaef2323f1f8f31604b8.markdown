As dialog systems are increasingly used, a major challenge for building new ones is the lack of annotated training data. The necessary data collection and annotation efforts are laborious and time-consuming. A potential solution is to augment initial seed data by automatically paraphrasing existing samples. In this paper, we propose a novel dataefficient approach towards this goal. Our method can kick-start a dialog system with minimum human effort while delivering a performance strong enough to …
