Adversarial perturbation plays a significant role in the field of adversarial robustness, which solves a maximization problem over the input data. We show that the backward propagation of such optimization can accelerate $2\times $(and thus the overall optimization including the forward propagation can accelerate $1.5\times $), without any utility drop, if we only compute the output gradient but not the parameter gradient during the backward propagation.
