The deep-learning-based measurement method with the through-focus scanning optical microscopy (TSOM) estimated the size of the object using the classification. However, the measurement performance of the method depends on the number of subdivided classes, and it is practically difficult to prepare data at regular intervals for training each class. We propose an approach to measure the size of an object in the TSOM image using the deep-learning regression model instead of using Cites: A closer look at deep learning heuristics: Learning rate restarts
