Constructing a robust dialogue system on spoken conversations bring more challenge than written conversation. In this respect, DSTC10-Track2-Task2 is proposed, which aims to build a task-oriented dialogue (TOD) system incorporating unstructured external knowledge on a spoken conversation, extending DSTC9-Track1. This paper introduces our system containing four advanced methods: data construction, weighted negative sampling, post-training, and style transfer.
