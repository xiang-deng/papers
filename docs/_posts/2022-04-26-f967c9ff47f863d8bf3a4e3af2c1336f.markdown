Predicting and measuring the impact of traffic collisions is crucial for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Numerous works in this field have successfully applied graph neural networks to ITS. Existing research on graph neural networks mainly relies on the graph Fourier transform, assuming neighborhood homophily. The homophily assumption, on the other hand, makes it difficult to define abrupt signals such as traffic accidents. Our research proposes an abrupt graph wavelet network Cites: Strategies for pre-training graph neural networks
