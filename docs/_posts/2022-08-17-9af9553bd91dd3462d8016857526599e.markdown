Relation extraction (RE) is an important task for many natural language processing applications. Document-level relation extraction task aims to extract the relations within a document and poses many challenges to the RE tasks as it requires reasoning across sentences and handling multiple relations expressed in the same document. Existing state-of-the-art document-level RE models use the graph structure to better connect long-distance correlations. In this work, we propose Cites: Coreferential reasoning learning for language representation
