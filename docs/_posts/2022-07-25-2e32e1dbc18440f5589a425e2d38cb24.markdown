Text segmentation plays an important role in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like summarization, context understanding, document indexing and document noise removal. Previous methods for this task require manual feature engineering, huge memory requirements and large execution times. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to present a novel supervised neural approach for text segmentation. Specifically, we propose an attention-based  Cites: SITS: A hierarchical nonparametric model using speaker identity
