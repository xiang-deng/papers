One typical approach to long-form document matching is first conducting alignment between cross-document sentence pairs and then aggregating all of the sentence-level matching signals. However, this approach could be problematic because the alignment between documents is partialdespite two documents as a whole are well-matched, most of the sentences could still be dissimilar. Those dissimilar sentences lead to spurious sentence-level matching signals which may overwhelm Cites: ERASER: A benchmark to evaluate rationalized NLP models
