Natural language inference (NLI) is an increasingly important task of natural language processing, and the explainable NLI generates natural language explanations (NLEs) in addition to label prediction, to make NLI explainable and acceptable. However, NLEs generated by current models often present problems that disobey of commonsense or lack of informativeness. In this paper, we propose a knowledge enhanced explainable NLI framework (KxNLI) by leveraging Knowledge  Cites: GreaseLM: Graph REASoning Enhanced Language Models for
