Transformers are now widely utilized in code intelligence tasks. To better fit highly structured source code, various structure information is passed into Transformer, such as positional encoding and abstract syntax tree (AST) based structures. However, it is still not clear how these structural features affect code intelligence tasks, such as code summarization. Addressing this problem is of vital importance for designing Transformer-based code models. Existing works are keen to introduce  Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
