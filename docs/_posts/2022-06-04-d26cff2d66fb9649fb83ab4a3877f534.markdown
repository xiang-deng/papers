Financial named entity recognition (FinNER) from literature is a challenging task in the field of financial text information extraction, which aims to extract a large amount of financial knowledge from unstructured texts. It is widely accepted to use sequence tagging frameworks to implement FinNER tasks. However, such sequence tagging models cannot fully take advantage of the semantic information in the texts. Instead, we formulate the FinNER task as a machine reading comprehension (MRC) problem  Cites: Representation Learning for Natural Language Processing
