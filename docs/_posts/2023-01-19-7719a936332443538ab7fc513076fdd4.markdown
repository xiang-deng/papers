Code review is a software quality assurance practice, yet remains time-consuming (eg, due to slow feedback from reviewers). Recent Neural Machine Translation (NMT)-based code transformation approaches were proposed to automatically generate an approved version of changed methods for a given submitted patch. The existing approaches could change code tokens in any area in a changed method. However, not all code tokens need to be changed. Intuitively, the changed code  Cites: Codebleu: a method for automatic evaluation of code synthesis
