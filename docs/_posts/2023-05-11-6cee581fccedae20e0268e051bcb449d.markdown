This paper presents a new synthesis-based approach for solving the Learning from Demonstration (LfD) problem in robotics. Given a set of user demonstrations, the goal of programmatic LfD is to learn a policy in a programming language that can be used to control a robot s behavior. We address this problem through a novel program synthesis algorithm that leverages two key ideas: First, to perform fast and effective generalization from user demonstrations, our synthesis algorithm views these Cites: Automated transpilation of imperative to functional code using
