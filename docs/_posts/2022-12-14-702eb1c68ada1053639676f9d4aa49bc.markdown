Value alignment is the task of creating autonomous systems whose values align with those of humans. Past work has shown that stories are a potentially rich source of information on human values; however, past work has been limited to considering values in a binary sense. In this work, we explore the use of machine learning models for the task of normative principle prediction on naturally occurring story data. To do this, we extend a dataset that has been previously used to train a binary …
