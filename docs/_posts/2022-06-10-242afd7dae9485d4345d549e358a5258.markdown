A growing body of research runs human subject evaluations to study whether providing users with explanations of machine learning models can help them with practical real-world use cases. However, running user studies is challenging and costly, and consequently each study typically only evaluates a limited number of different settings, eg, studies often only evaluate a few arbitrarily selected explanation methods. To address these challenges and aid user study design, we …
