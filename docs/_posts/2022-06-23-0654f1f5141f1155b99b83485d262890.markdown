As a new form of public transportation, shared bikes have greatly facilitated people s travel in recent years. However, in the actual operation process, the uneven distribution of bicycles at each shared bicycle station has limited the travel experience. In this paper, we propose a deep spatio-temporal residual network model based on Region-reConStruction algorithm to predict the usage of shared bikes in the bike-sharing system. We first propose an Region-reConStruction …
