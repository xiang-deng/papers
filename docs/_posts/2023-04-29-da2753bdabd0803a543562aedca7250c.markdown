Change captioning is to describe the fine-grained change between a pair of images. The pseudo changes caused by viewpoint changes are the most typical distractors in this task, because they lead to the feature perturbation and shift for the same objects and thus overwhelm the real change representation. In this paper, we propose a viewpoint-adaptive representation disentanglement network to distinguish real and pseudo changes, and explicitly capture the features of change to generate accurate …
