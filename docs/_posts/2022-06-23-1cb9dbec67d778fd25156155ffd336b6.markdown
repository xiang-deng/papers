Machine learning becomes increasingly prevalent and integrated into a wide range of software systems. These systems, named ML systems, must be adequately tested to gain confidence that they behave correctly. Although many research efforts have been devoted to testing technologies for ML systems, the industrial teams are faced with new challenges on testing the ML systems in real-world settings. To absorb inspirations from the industry on the problems in ML testing, we conducted an …
