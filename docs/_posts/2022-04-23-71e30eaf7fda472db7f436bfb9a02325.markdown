Representation learning enables us to automatically extract generic feature representations from a dataset to solve another machine learning task. Recently, extracted feature representations by a representation learning algorithm and a simple predictor have exhibited state-of-the-art performance on several machine learning tasks. Despite its remarkable progress, there exist various ways to evaluate representation learning algorithms depending on the application because of the Cites: Fine-tuning can distort pretrained features and underperform out-of
