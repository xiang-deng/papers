The article analyzes problems of deep learning (DL) approaches to natural language processing (NLP). The research covers various NLP tasks implemented with artificial neural networks (ANNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These architectures allow solving a wide range of natural language processing problems that previously did not lend themselves to effective solutions: sentence modeling, semantic role marking, named entity recognition Cites: A Neural Network for Factoid Question Answering over Paragraphs
