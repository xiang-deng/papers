Sequential product recommendation, aiming at predicting the products that a target user will interact with soon, has become a hotspot topic. Most of the sequential recommendation models focus on learning from users  interacted product sequences in a purely data-driven manner. However, they largely overlook the knowledgeable substitutable and complementary relations between products. To address this issue, we propose a novel Substitutable and Complementary Graph-based Sequential Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
