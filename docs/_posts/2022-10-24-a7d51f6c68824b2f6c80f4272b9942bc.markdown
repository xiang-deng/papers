Abstract We present Multiscale Extrapolative Learning Algorithm (MELA) as a novel artificial-intelligence (AI)-based data extrapolator. MELA is capable of extending temporally limited local hydroclimatic measurements at fine spatial resolution to longer periods, using remotely-sensed hydroclimatic data readily available for longer periods but at coarse spatial resolution. We demonstrate the implementation of MELA to extrapolate the monthly local soil moisture measurements at multiple depths  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
