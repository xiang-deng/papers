Traditional machine learning models focus on achieving good performance on the overall training distribution, but they often underperform on minority groups. Existing methods can improve the worst-group performance, but they can have several limitations:(i) they require group annotations, which are often expensive and sometimes infeasible to obtain, and/or (ii) they are sensitive to outliers. Most related works fail to solve these two issues simultaneously as they focus on conflicting …
