Combining 3D printing and smart materials, 4D printing technologies enable the printed actuators to further change their shapes or other properties after prototyping. However, the shape morphing of 4D printed actuators suffers from poor controllability and low precision. One of the main challenges is that the 4D printed actuators are hard to be modeled and it is difficult to develop an appropriate controller for them. In this study, various popular reinforcement learning (RL) methods are applied to …
