As the principal means of oil and natural gas transportation, oil and gas pipeline systems suffer from common corrosion problems, accurate corrosion prediction of oil and gas pipelines has an essential influence on pipe material selection, remaining useful life prediction, maintenance planning, etc. At present, a large number of corrosion monitoring techniques are applied in oil and gas pipeline systems. The monitored data have the characteristics of multidimensional quantities, noise …
