Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has recently emerged as a crucial area in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system for understanding the user s inner state and intention. However, feature-and label-noise constitute the major challenge for FER in the wild due to the ambiguity of facial expressions worsened by low-quality images. To deal with this problem, in this paper, we propose a simple but effective Facial Expression Noise-tolerant Network (FENN) which explores the inter-class Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
