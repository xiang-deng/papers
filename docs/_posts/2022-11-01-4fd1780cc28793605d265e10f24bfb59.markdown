Inspired by recent and revolutionary developments in AI, particularly in language understanding and generation, we set about designing AI systems that are able to address complex scientific tasks that challenge human capabilities to make new discoveries. Central to our approach is the notion of natural language as core representation, reasoning, and exchange format between scientific AI and human scientists. In this paper, we identify and discuss some of the main research …
