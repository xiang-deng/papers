Accurate crop mapping is critical for agricultural applications. Although studies have combined deep learning methods and time-series satellite images to crop classification with satisfactory results, most of them focused on supervised methods, which are usually applicable to a specific domain and lose their validity in new domains. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) was proposed to solve this limitation by transferring knowledge from source domains with labeled samples to …
