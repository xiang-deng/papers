Graph representation learning aims at mapping a graph into a lower-dimensional feature space. Deep attributed graph representation, utilizing deep learning models on the graph structure and attributes, shows its significance in mining complex relational data. Most existing deep attributed graph representation models assume graph attributes in a single-attributed view. However, rich information in real-world applications demands the ability to handle multiple attributed views. For example, in  Cites: Adaptive Graph Encoder for Attributed Graph Embedding
