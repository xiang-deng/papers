Abstract The Bioconcentration Factor (BCF) is an important parameter in the environmental risk assessment of chemicals, relevant for industrial and academic research as well as required in many regulatory contexts. It represents the potential of a substance to accumulate in organic tissues or whole animals and is most frequently measured in fish. However, animal welfare reasons, throughput limitations, and costs push the need for alternative methods that allow accurate and Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
