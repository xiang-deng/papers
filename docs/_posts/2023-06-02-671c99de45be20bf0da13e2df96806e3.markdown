We introduce Logical Offline Cycle Consistency Optimization (LOCCO), a scalable, semi-supervised method for training a neural semantic parser. Conceptually, LOCCO can be viewed as a form of self-learning where the semantic parser being trained is used to generate annotations for unlabeled text that are then used as new supervision. To increase the quality of annotations, our method utilizes a count-based prior over valid formal meaning representations and a cycle-consistency score  Cites: Language to logical form with neural attention
