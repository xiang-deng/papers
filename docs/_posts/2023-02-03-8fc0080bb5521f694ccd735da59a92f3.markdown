Response generation is one of the critical components in task-oriented dialog systems. Existing studies have shown that large pre-trained language models can be adapted to this task. The typical paradigm of adapting such extremely large language models would be by fine-tuning on the downstream tasks which is not only time-consuming but also involves significant resources and access to fine-tuning data. Prompting\citep {schick2020exploiting} has been an alternative to fine-tuning in  Cites: Making Pre-trained Language Models Better Few-shot Learners
