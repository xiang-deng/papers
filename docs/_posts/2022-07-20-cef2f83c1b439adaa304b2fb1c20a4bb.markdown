Relation prediction is a task for knowledge graph completion which is targeted at predicting missing relationships between entities. Most previous works focus on learning latent representations of entities and relations, resulting in the limitation of transductive setting where the model is incapable of directly predicting relations for unseen entities. In order to predict relation inductively, recent works provide alternatives to operate on the subgraph surrounding a candidate triplet. However  Cites: Glove: Global vectors for word representation
