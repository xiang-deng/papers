Abstract Conventional Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) has been well-addressed by pattern matching, but the ability of commonsense reasoning remains a gap between humans and machines. Previous methods tackle this problem by enriching word representations via pretrained Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE). However, they make limited use of a large number of connections between nodes in Knowledge Graphs (KG), which can be pivotal cues for building the commonsense …
