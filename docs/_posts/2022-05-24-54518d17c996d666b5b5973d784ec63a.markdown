GPCRs are the target for one-third of the FDA-approved drugs, however; the development of new drug molecules targeting GPCRs is limited by the lack of mechanistic understanding of the GPCR structure-activity-function relationship. To modulate the GPCR activity with highly specific drugs and minimal side-effects, it is necessary to quantitatively describe the important structural features in the GPCR and correlate them to the activation state of GPCR. In this study, we developed 3 ML  Cites: Strategies for pre-training graph neural networks
