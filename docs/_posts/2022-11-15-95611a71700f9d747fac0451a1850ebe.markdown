Nowadays, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have become fundamental building blocks for a wide range of AI applications. The popularity of these methods also makes them widely exposed to malicious attacks, which may cause severe security concerns. To understand the security properties of the ML/DL methods, researchers have recently started to turn their focus to adversarial attack algorithms that could successfully corrupt the model or clean data owned by the  Cites: Statistical decision making for optimal budget allocation in crowd
