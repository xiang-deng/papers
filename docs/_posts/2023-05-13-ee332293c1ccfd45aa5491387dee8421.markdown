The performance of computer vision models is susceptible to unexpected changes in input images when deployed in real scenarios. These changes are referred to as common corruptions. While they can hinder the applicability of computer vision models in real-world scenarios, they are not always considered as a testbed for model generalization and robustness. In this survey, we present a comprehensive and systematic overview of methods that improve corruption robustness of computer Cites: Out-of-Distribution Robustness via Targeted Augmentations
