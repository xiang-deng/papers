Given BM25 s enduring competitiveness as an information retrieval baseline, we investigate to what extent it can be even further improved by augmenting and re-weighting its sparse query-vector representation. We propose an approach to learning an augmentation and a re-weighting end-to-end, and we find that our approach improves performance over BM25 while retaining its speed. We furthermore find that the learned augmentations and re-weightings transfer well to …
