Blocking is a major task in entity matching. Numerous blocking solutions have been developed, but as far as we can tell, blocking using the well-known tf/idf measure has received virtually no attention. Yet, when we experimented with tf/idf blocking using Lucene, we found it did quite well. So in this paper we examine tf/idf blocking in depth. We develop Sparkly, which uses Lucene to perform top-k tf/idf blocking in a distributed share-nothing fashion on a Spark cluster. We develop techniques to …
