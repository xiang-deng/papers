Deep learning and neuroscience research have significantly progressed in the past few decades. While deep learning s conception and several key developments have been inspired by neuroscientific knowledge, the reverse osmosis of artificial neural network application in neuroscience has been limited. In this thesis, we tackle two important, but relatively under-explored tasks of brain images synthesis using deep learning. The first task bridges the gap between task-based and resting-state …
