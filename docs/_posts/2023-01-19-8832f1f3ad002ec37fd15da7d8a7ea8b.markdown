Improving machine translation (MT) systems with translation memories (TMs) is of great interest to practitioners in the MT community. However, previous approaches require either a significant update of the model architecture and/or additional training efforts to make the models well-behaved when TMs are taken as additional input. In this paper, we present a simple but effective method to introduce TMs into neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Specifically, we treat TMs as prompts to the NMT  Cites: Search engine guided neural machine translation
