There is a consensus that focusing only on accuracy in searching for optimal machine learning models amplifies biases contained in the data, leading to unfair predictions and decision supports. Recently, multi-objective hyperparameter optimization has been proposed to search for machine learning models which offer equally Pareto-efficient trade-offs between accuracy and fairness. Although these approaches proved to be more versatile than fairness-aware machine learning Cites: Green AI
