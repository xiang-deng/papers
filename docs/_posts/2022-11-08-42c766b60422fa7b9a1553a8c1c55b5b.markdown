Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used in many modern applications, necessitating explanations for their decisions. However, the complexity of GNNs makes it difficult to explain predictions. Even though several methods have been proposed lately, they can only provide simple and static explanations, which are difficult for users to understand in many scenarios. Therefore, we introduce INGREX, an interactive explanation framework for GNNs designed to aid users in  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
