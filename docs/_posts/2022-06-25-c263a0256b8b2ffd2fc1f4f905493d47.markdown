Recent advances in machine learning have significantly improved the understanding of source code data and achieved good performance on a number of downstream tasks. Open source repositories like GitHub enable this process with rich unlabeled code data. However, the lack of high quality labeled data has largely hindered the progress of several code related tasks, such as program translation, summarization, synthesis, and code search. This paper introduces XLCoST, Cross-Lingual Code  Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
