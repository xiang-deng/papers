Traditional training paradigms for extractive and abstractive summarization systems always only use token-level or sentence-level training objectives. However, the output summary is always evaluated from summary-level which leads to the inconsistency in training and evaluation. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive Learning based re-ranking framework for one-stage summarization called COLO. By modeling a contrastive objective, we show that the summarization model is able to  Cites: Better fine-tuning by reducing representational collapse
