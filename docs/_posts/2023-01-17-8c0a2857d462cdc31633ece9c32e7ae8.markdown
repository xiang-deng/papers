Outlier detection, also known as anomaly detection, aims to identify samples that differ significantly from the general data distribution. It is a crucial machine learning task with numerous applications in finance, security, and healthcare. In the past few decades, a large number of unsupervised detection algorithms have been proposed, while using them in real-world applications still faces challenges in (i) how to select a good detection model to deploy without ground truth labels and (ii) how to build …
