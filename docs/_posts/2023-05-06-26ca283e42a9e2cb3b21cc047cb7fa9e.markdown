Accurate and automatic power line anomaly detection is critical to the smart grid. However, effective solutions are yet available due to the insufficiency of anomaly data. In this paper, we first collect a dataset from various sources consisting of both normal and abnormal power line images. With this dataset, anomaly detection becomes feasible though with limited accuracy due to the limited size of the dataset. As such, we propose TransLine, an approach based on transfer learning to apply the Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
