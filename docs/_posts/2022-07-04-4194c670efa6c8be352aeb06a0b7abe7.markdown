In a large domain of classification problems for real applications, like human activity recognition, separable spaces between groups of concepts are easier to learn than each concept alone. This is because the search space biases required to separate groups of classes (or concepts) are more relevant than the ones needed to separate classes individually. For example, it is easier to learn the activities related to the body movements group (running, walking) versus  on-wheels  activities group (bicycling …
