This chapter introduces TRUncated ReinForcement Learning for Language (TrufLL), an original approach to train conditional language models from scratch by only using reinforcement learning (RL). As RL methods unsuccessfully scale to large action spaces, we dynamically truncate the vocabulary space using a generic language model. TrufLL thus enables to train a language agent by solely interacting with its environment without any task-specific prior knowledge; it is only guided with a task …
