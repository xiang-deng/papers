Building multi-person pose estimation (MPPE) models that can handle complex foreground and uncommon scenes is an important challenge in computer vision. Aside from designing novel models, strengthening training data is a promising direction but remains largely unexploited for the MPPE task. In this article, we systematically identify the key deficiencies of existing pose datasets that prevent the power of well-designed models from being fully exploited and propose the  Cites: Simple copy-paste is a strong data augmentation method for
