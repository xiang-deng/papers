Text analysis of power transformer defect record is a challenging task because of the large number of professional words and the scarcity of labelled text data. These problems make generic models less effective in the power transformer domain. Pre-trained models can help solve these problems as they can be pre-trained on large-scale cross-domain unlabeled data, and can solve tasks in specific domains by continue training on the corpus of specific domains. We introduce the pre-training Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
