We propose and release a new vulnerable source code dataset. We curate the dataset by crawling security issue websites, extracting vulnerability-fixing commits and source codes from the corresponding projects. Our new dataset contains 150 CWEs, 26,635 vulnerable functions, and 352,606 non-vulnerable functions extracted from 7,861 commits. Our dataset covers 305 more projects than all previous datasets combined. We show that increasing the diversity and volume of training data  Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
