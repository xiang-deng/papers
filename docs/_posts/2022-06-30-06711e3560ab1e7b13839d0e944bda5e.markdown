Background Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are often in critical condition and have a high mortality rate. Accurately predicting the survival probability of ICU patients is beneficial to timely care and prioritizing medical resources to improve the overall patient population survival. Models developed by deep learning (DL) algorithms show good performance on many models. However, few DL algorithms have been validated in the dimension of survival time or compared with traditional …
