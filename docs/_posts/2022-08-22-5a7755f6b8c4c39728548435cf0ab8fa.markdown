Lifelong language learning aims to stream learning NLP tasks while retaining knowledge of previous tasks. Previous works based on the language model and following data-free constraint approaches have explored formatting all data as begin token (\textit {B})+ context (\textit {C})+ question (\textit {Q})+ answer (\textit {A}) for different tasks. However, they still suffer from catastrophic forgetting and are exacerbated when the previous task s pseudo data is insufficient for the following Cites: Deep semantic role labeling: What works and whats next
