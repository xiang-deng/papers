ABSTRACT Recent studies on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) point out that most GNNs depend on the homophily assumption but fail to generalize to graphs with heterophily where dissimilar nodes connect. The concept of homophily or heterophily defined previously is a global measurement of the whole graph and cannot describe the local connectivity of a node. From the node-level perspective, we find that real-world graph structures exhibit a mixture of homophily and heterophily, which refers to Cites: Continual learning via neural pruning
