Semi-supervised learning has been an important approach to address challenges in extracting entities and relations from limited data. However, current semi-supervised works handle the two tasks (ie, Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction) separately and ignore the cross-correlation of entity and relation instances as well as the existence of similar instances across unlabeled data. To alleviate the issues, we propose Jointprop, a Heterogeneous Graph-based Propagation framework for joint Cites: Exploiting syntactico-semantic structures for relation extraction
