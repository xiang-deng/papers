Subgraph matching is to find all subgraphs in a data graph that are isomorphic to an existing query graph. Subgraph matching is an NP-hard problem, yet has found its applications in many areas. Many learning-based methods have been proposed for graph matching, whereas few have been designed for subgraph matching. The subgraph matching problem is generally more challenging, mainly due to the different sizes between the two graphs, resulting in considerable large space of  Cites: Reasoning With Neural Tensor Networks for Knowledge Base
