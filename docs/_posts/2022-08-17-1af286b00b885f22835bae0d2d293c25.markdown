Generating text adversarial examples in the hard-label setting is a more realistic and challenging black-box adversarial attack problem, whose challenge comes from the fact that gradient cannot be directly calculated from discrete word replacements. Consequently, the effectiveness of gradient-based methods for this problem still awaits improvement. In this paper, we propose a gradient-based optimization method named LeapAttack to craft high-quality text adversarial examples in the hard Cites: On Evaluation of Adversarial Perturbations for Sequence-to
