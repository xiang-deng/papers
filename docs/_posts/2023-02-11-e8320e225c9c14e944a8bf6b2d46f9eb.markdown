Multi-task learning (MTL) aims at learning related tasks in a unified model to achieve mutual improvement among tasks considering their shared knowledge. It is an important topic in recommendation due to the demand for multi-task prediction considering performance and efficiency. Although MTL has been well studied and developed, there is still a lack of systematic review in the recommendation community. To fill the gap, we provide a comprehensive review of existing multi-task …
