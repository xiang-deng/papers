We propose a method for using a large language model, such as GPT-3, to simulate responses of different humans in a given context. We test our method by attempting to reproduce well-established economic, psycholinguistic, and social experiments. The method requires prompt templates for each experiment. Simulations are run by varying the (hypothetical) subject details such as name and analyzing the text generated by the language model. We validate our methodology by using GPT-3, to Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
