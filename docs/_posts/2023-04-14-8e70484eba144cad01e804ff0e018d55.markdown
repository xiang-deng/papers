In the past few years, Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS) rapidly imposed itself as the trending approach to automate the discovery of deep neural network architectures. This rise is mainly due to the popularity of DARTS, one of the first major DNAS methods. In contrast with previous works based on Reinforcement Learning or Evolutionary Algorithms, DNAS is faster by several orders of magnitude and uses fewer computational resources. In this comprehensive survey, we focus …
