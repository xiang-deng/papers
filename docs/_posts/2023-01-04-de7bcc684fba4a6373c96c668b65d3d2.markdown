Obtaining large-scale and high-quality training data for multidocument summarization (MDS) tasks is time-consuming and resourceintensive, hence, supervised models can only be applied to limited domains and languages. In this paper, we introduce unsupervised extractive methods for both generic and query-focused MDS tasks, intending to produce a relevant summary from a collection of documents without using labeled training data or domain knowledge.
