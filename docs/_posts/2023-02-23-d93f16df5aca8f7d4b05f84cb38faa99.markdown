Delta compression uses the previous block of bytes to be used as a reference in the compression process for the next blocks. This approach is increasingly ineffective due to the duplication of byte sequences in modern files. Another delta compression model uses the numerical difference approach of the sequence of bytes contained in a file. Storing the difference value will require fewer representation bits than the original value. Base+ Delta is a compression model that uses delta which is obtained Cites: Automatic optimization for MapReduce programs
