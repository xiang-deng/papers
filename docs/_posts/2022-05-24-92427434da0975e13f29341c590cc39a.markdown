Pre-training models have shown their power in sequential recommendation. Recently, prompt has been widely explored and verified for tuning in NLP pre-training, which could help to more effectively and efficiently extract useful knowledge from pre-training models for downstream tasks, especially in cold-start scenarios. However, it is challenging to bring prompt-tuning from NLP to recommendation, since the tokens in recommendation (ie, items) do not have explicit explainable semantics … Cites: ‪How can we know what language models know?‬
