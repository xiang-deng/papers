Text ranking models based on BERT are now well established for a wide range of pas-sage and document ranking tasks. However, the robustness of BERT-based ranking models under adversarial attack is under-explored. In this work, we argue that BERT-rankers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks targeting retrieved documents given a query. We propose algorithms for generating adversarial perturbation of documents locally to individual queries or globally across the dataset  Cites: Pathologies of Neural Models Make Interpretation Difficult
