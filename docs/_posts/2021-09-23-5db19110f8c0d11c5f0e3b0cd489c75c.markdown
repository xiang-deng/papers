Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to predict the sentiment polarity of specific aspect words occurring in a text. ABSA includes aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA) and aspect-target sentiment analysis (ATSA). There have been many previous studies addressing both tasks through RNNs and other neural models. With BERT s remarkable performance on NLP tasks, several studies have enhanced aspect word extraction to solve ATSA by building new BERT-based Cites: Aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network
