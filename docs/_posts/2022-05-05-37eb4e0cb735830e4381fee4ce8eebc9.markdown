In language understanding for dialog systems, slot filling is a fundamental task usually formulated as a sequence labeling problem and solved using discriminative models such as conditional random fields and neural networks. One of the weak points of the discriminative approach is in the robustness against incomplete annotations, which are often generated in practice when we attempt to build large- scale training data. For making the slot filling algorithm more robust against the Cites: Pointwise prediction for robust, adaptable Japanese morphological
