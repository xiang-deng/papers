This paper aims for a potential architectural breakthrough for multilingual learning and asks: could different tasks from different languages be modeled in a monolithic framework (without any task/language-specific module)? The benefit of achieving this is not only that systems trained on low resources scenario can be assisted by more other languages and tasks, but opening new doors for future multilingual research. We approach this goal by developing a learning framework Polyglot Cites: DataLab: A Platform for Data Analysis and Intervention
