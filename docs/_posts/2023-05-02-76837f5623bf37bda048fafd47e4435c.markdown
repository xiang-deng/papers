As the minimum semantic units of natural languages, sememes can provide precise representations of concepts. Despite the widespread utilization of lexical resources for semantic tasks, use of sememes is limited by a lack of available sememe knowledge bases. Recent efforts have been made to connect BabelNet with HowNet by automating sememe prediction. However, these methods depend on large manually annotated datasets. We propose to use sense alignment via a novel …
