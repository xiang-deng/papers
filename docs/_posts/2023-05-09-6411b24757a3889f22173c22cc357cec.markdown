Slot filling is a major problem in spoken language understanding (SLU) task. However, the current SLU models may experience performance degradation when encountering unfamiliar data in different datasets. Meanwhile, as recent models are becoming more complex, retraining the model in a new application scenario would be too expensive. So we think it is important to study the robustness and generalization capability of SLU models. Then we propose the Natural Adversarial …
