With reliable and accurate grain temperature forecasting models, granary operators could easily make the right decisions to avoid food spoilage. In this study, an analysis of a single hidden layer long short-term memory model, a multi-layer (stacked) long short-term memory model, and its evaluation is presented to determine how accurate it is for forecasting stored grain s temperature from past data. Using temperature sensors, the data is collected over three years in a warehouse in  Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
