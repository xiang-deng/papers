We construct a natural language inference (NLI) benchmark 1 to test the spatial reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs). Many commonsense benchmarks test spatial reasoning abilities simultaneously with other reasoning abilities, and a few benchmarks test certain specific spatial reasoning abilities rigorously, but no prior works have sought to evaluate LMs on a comprehensive suite of spatial reasoning tasks. To do this, we use templates to procedurally generate a large  Cites: CommonsenseQA: A Question Answering Challenge Targeting
