The current text generation generally requires understanding the contextual derivation of corpus based on a large amount of data. In fact, it is very difficult because of the limited data. We develop a novel text generation algorithm based on few-shot learning data which uses a dual-channel decoder and can smoothly perform copying and generating for the predicted words. Experimental results show that this proposed algorithm s efficiency.  Cites: Data-to-text generation with content selection and planning
