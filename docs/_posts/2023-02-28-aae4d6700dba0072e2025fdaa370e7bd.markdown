The aim of this expository paper is to present the properties of the linear skew-t distribution, which is a specific example of a symmetry modulated-distribution. The skewing function remains the distribution function of Student st, but its argument is simpler than that used for the standard skew-t. The linear skew-t offers different insights, for example, different moments and tail behavior, and can be simpler to use for empirical work. It is shown that the distribution may be expressed as a hidden …
