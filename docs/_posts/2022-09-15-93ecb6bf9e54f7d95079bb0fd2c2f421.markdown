Hydrogen is considered to be a clean energy alternative to non-renewable fossil fuels. Hydrogen storage using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has received more attention in recent years. Their higher pore volume, high density of interaction sites, and a wide variety of structures contribute to their greater versatility. MOFs for hydrogen storage was discussed in this article, including their mechanism, preparation, and factors. In this study, several conventional and distinct methods for Cites: Theoretical limits of hydrogen storage in metalorganic
