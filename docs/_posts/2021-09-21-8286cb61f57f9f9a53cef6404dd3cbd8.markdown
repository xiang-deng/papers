Code generation is an important research field of software engineering, aiming to reduce development costs and improve program quality. Nowadays, more and more researchers intend to implement code generation by natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a generation method to convert natural language descriptions to the program code based on deep learning. We use an encoder-decoder model with gated attention mechanism. Here, the decoder is an Cites: Reranking for neural semantic parsing
