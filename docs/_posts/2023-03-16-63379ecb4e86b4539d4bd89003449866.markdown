The detection of anomalous behavior in business process data is a crucial task for preventing failures that may jeopardize the performance of any organization. Supervised learning techniques are impracticable because of the difficulties of gathering huge amounts of labeled business process anomaly data. For this reason, unsupervised learning techniques and semi-supervised learning approaches trained on entirely labeled normal data have dominated this domain for a long time  Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
