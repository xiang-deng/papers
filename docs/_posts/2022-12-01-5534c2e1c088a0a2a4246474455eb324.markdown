Despite the wide use of inline formatting, not much has been studied on translating sentences with inline formatted tags. The detag-andproject approach using word alignments is one solution to translating a tagged sentence. However, the method has a limitation: tag reinsertion is not considered in the translation process. Another solution is to use an end-to-end model which takes text with inline tags as inputs and translates them into a tagged sentence. This approach can alleviate the problems of …
