Several studies have empirically compared in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance of various models. They report frequent positive correlations on benchmarks in computer vision and NLP. Surprisingly, they never observe inverse correlations suggesting necessary trade-offs. This matters to determine whether ID performance can serve as a proxy for OOD generalization. This short paper shows that inverse correlations between ID and OOD performance do happen in real-world Cites: Accuracy on the line: on the strong correlation between out-of
