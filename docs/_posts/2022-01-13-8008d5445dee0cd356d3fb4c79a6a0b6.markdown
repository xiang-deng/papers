Cross-modality person re-identification aims at matching the RGB images of a specific person in variable appearances with his/her images in another modality like infrared modality, sketch modality, etc. It is challenging due to domain gap and intra- class variations. Existing Re-id models usually employ symmetric or identical feature extractors in two modalities and single-stream classification algorithms for extracting modality-invariant and identity-discriminative feature representations. However, we Cites: Feature noise induces loss discrepancy across groups
