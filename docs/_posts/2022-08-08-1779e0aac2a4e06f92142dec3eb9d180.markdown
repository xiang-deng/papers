ABSTRACT As User Reviews (URs) of mobile Apps are proven to provide valuable feedback for maintaining and evolving applications, how to make full use of URs more efficiently in the release cycle of mobile Apps has become a widely concerned and researched topic in the Software Engineering (SE) community. In order to speed up the completion of coding work related to URs to shorten the release cycle as much as possible, the task of User Review-based code localization is proposed and Cites: Dawn Drain, Neel Sundaresan, Jian Yin, Daxin Jiang, and Ming
