State-of-the-art image classifiers trained on massive datasets (such as ImageNet) have been shown to be vulnerable to a range of both intentional and incidental distribution shifts. On the other hand, several recent classifiers with favorable out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness properties have emerged, achieving high accuracy on their target tasks while maintaining their in-distribution accuracy on challenging benchmarks. We present a meta-analysis on a wide range of publicly released …
