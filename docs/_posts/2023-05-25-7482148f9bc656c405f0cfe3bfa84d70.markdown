Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot or few-shot commonsense reasoning performance on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, despite their strong commonsense reasoning abilities, LLMs still exhibit various kinds of inconsistency problems. While previous researches mainly focused on the self-consistency within a single LLM, we propose to explore the inter-consistency issue between two or more LLMs, which is critical for diverse …
