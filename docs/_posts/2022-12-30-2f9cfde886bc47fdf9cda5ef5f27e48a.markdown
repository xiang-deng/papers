Luminescence thermometry has emerged as an effective way to implement non-invasive thermal reading and finds promising applications in many fields. Nevertheless, traditional luminescence thermometric methods, such as the luminescence intensity ratio, are generally carried out based on one single temperature-dependent spectral feature. As a result, other thermal related spectral features were ignored, which radically restricts the sensing performance. Herein, we …
