Distributional semantics has been at the core of recent developments in deep learning work for natural language processing. This distributional semantics plus neural processing paradigm has resulted in significant improvements in state of the art results across a large number of tasks, including parsing, text classification, and machine translation. However, there are a number of areas of natural language processing research where this shift in paradigm has not resulted in significant Cites: Experience grounds language
