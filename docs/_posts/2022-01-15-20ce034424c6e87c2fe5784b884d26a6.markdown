The effective method to utilize monolingual data and enhance the performance of neural machine translation models is back-translation. Iteratively conducting back- translation can further improve the performance of the translation model. In back- translation where, pseudo sentence pairs are generated to train the translation systems with a reconstruction loss, but all the pseudo sentence pairs are not of good quality, which can severely impact the performance of neural machine translation Cites: Nematus: a toolkit for neural machine translation
