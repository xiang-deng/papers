Entity linking (EL) is a fundamental task in natural language processing. Based on neural networks, existing systems pay more attention to the construction of the global model, but ignore latent semantic information in the local model and the acquisition of effective entity type information. In this paper, we propose two adaptive features, in which the first adaptive feature enables the local and global models to capture latent information, and the second adaptive feature describes effective information for entity Cites: Neural Collective Entity Linking
