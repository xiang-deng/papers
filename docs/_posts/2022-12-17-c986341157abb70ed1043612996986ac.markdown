As the functionality of dialogue systems evolves, hybrid dialogue systems that accomplish user-specific goals and participate in open-topic chitchat with users are attracting growing attention. Existing research learns both tasks concurrently utilizing a multi-task fusion technique but ignores the negative transfer phenomenon induced by the unique textual style differences. Therefore, contrastive learning based on the latent variable model is used to decouple the various textual genres in the latent  Cites: Prefix-tuning: Optimizing continuous prompts for generation
