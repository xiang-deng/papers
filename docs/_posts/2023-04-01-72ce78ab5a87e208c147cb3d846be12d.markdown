We present a large-scale empirical investigation of the zero-shot learning phenomena in a specific recognizing textual entailment (RTE) task category, ie the automated mining of leaderboards for Empirical AI Research. The prior reported state-of-the-art models for leaderboards extraction formulated as an RTE task, in a non-zero-shot setting, are promising with above 90% reported performances. However, a central research question remains unexamined: did the models actually Cites: CitationIE: Leveraging the Citation Graph for Scientific Information
