Domain generalization is hitherto an underexplored area applied in abstractive summarization. Moreover, most existing works on domain generalization have sophisticated training algorithms. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, weight averaging based, Domain Aligned Prefix Averaging approach to domain generalization for abstractive summarization. Given a number of source domains, our method first trains a prefix for each one of them. These source prefixes generate  Cites: Meta-learning for domain generalization in semantic parsing
