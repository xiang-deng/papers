Multi-party computing (MPC) has been gaining popularity over the past years as a secure computing model, particularly for machine learning (ML) inference. Compared with its competitors, MPC has fewer overheads than homomorphic encryption (HE) and has a more robust threat model than hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEE) such as Intel SGX. Despite its apparent advantages, MPC protocols still pay substantial performance penalties compared to plaintext …
