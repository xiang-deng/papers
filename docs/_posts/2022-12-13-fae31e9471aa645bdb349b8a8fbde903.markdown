Improving the explainability of Computer Vision models based on Deep Learning has recently become a compelling problem, ensuring reliable predictions to the end-user and enabling more fine-grained classifications. Recently, Concept Bottleneck models have been proposed for images classification, partitioning the problem in two stages and thereby defining a hierarchy of concepts. So far, however, little work has been done to investigate the applicability of this approach to other datasets with …
