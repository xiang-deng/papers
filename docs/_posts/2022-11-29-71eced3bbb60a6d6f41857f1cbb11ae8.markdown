The goal of this thesis is to improve the feasibility of building applied NLP systems for more diverse and niche real-world use-cases of extracting structured information from text. A core factor in determining this feasibility is the cost of manually annotating enough unbiased labeled data to achieve a desired level of system accuracy, and our goal is to reduce this cost. We focus on reducing this cost by making contributions in two directions:
