Many dialogue systems (DSs) lack characteristics humans have, such as emotion perception, factuality, and informativeness. Enhancing DSs with knowledge alleviates this problem, but, as many ways of doing so exist, keeping track of all proposed methods is difficult. Here, we present the first survey of knowledge-enhanced DSs. We define three categories of systems-internal, external, and hybrid-based on the knowledge they use. We survey the motivation for enhancing DSs with Cites: Latent retrieval for weakly supervised open domain question
