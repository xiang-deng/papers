The conventional seq2seq-based question generation usually treats the answer as a span within the document. But answers cannot always be literally found in documents, especially for those generated in an abstractive manner. In order to address this issue, we propose a Multi-Channel Fusion Encoder-Decoder model (MCFED) to generate questions corresponding to abstractive answers. The model uses two encoders, one for the document and the other for the abstractive answer Cites: Question generation for question answering
