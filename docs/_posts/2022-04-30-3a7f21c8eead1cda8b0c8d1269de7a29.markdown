While controllable text generation has received attention due to the recent advances in large-scale pre-trained language models, there is a lack of research that focuses on story-specific controllability. To address this, we present Story Control via Supervised Contrastive learning model (SCSC), to create a story conditioned on genre. For this, we design a supervised contrastive objective combined with log- likelihood objective, to capture the intrinsic differences among the stories in different Cites: Learning discriminative projections for text similarity measures
