The idea of the wisdom of the crowd is that integrating multiple estimates of a group of individuals provides an outcome that is often better than most of the underlying estimates or even better than the best individual estimate. In this paper, we examine the wisdom of the crowd principle on the example of spatial data collection by paid crowdworkers. We developed a web-based user interface for the collection of vehicles from rasterized shadings derived from 3D point clouds and executed Cites: Learning from the Wisdom of Crowds by Minimax Entropy.
