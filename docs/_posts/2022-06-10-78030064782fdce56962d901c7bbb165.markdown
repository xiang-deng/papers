The ALARIS laboratory is developing a mobile manipulator for POMDP-based object grasping tasks. It is necessary to develop a simulation environment for testing purposes. However, the task can be repeated using different robotic platforms after the completion of the project. As a result, it was decided to develop a simulation framework that meets the requirements of the project. The requirements for such a framework were defined through the analysis of the resources with similar setups  Cites: Proactive Action Visual Residual Reinforcement Learning for
