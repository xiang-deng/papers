Deep Learning (DL) is a special class of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, studying the training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Thanks to the modularity of their structure, these models are effective in a variety of problems ranging from computer vision to speech recognition. Particularly in the last few years, DL has achieved impressive results. Nonetheless, the excitement around the field may remain disappointed since there are still many open issues. In this thesis, we Cites: Concept bottleneck models
