Semantic code clone detection involves the detection of functionally similar code fragments which may otherwise be lexically, syntactically, or structurally dissimilar. The detection of semantic code clones has important applications in aspect mining and product line analysis. The accurate detection of semantic code clones is a challenging task and various techniques have been proposed. However, the evaluation of these techniques is performed using various datasets and we do not  Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
