In this paper, we use an agent-based model (ABM) to run (counter) mobility scenarios to explore which characteristics of intermediate force capabilities (IFC) are relevant to these, and how they can affect outcomes in gray zone conflicts. Using an ABM called Map-Aware Non-Uniform Automata (MANA), developed by the New Zealand Defense Technology Agency, we implemented two scenarios where the friendly forces mobility was limited by large groups of civilians. Then, we employed  Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
