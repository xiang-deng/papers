Abstract Knowledge extraction aims to identify entities and extract relations between them from unstructured text, which are in the form of triplets. Analysis of the fruit nutrition domain corpus revealed many overlapping triplets, that is, multiple correspondences between a subject and multiple objects or the same subject and object. The current relevant methods mainly target the extraction of ordinary triplets, which cannot accurately identify overlapping triplets. To solve this problem, a deep Cites: A Frustratingly Easy Approach for Entity and Relation Extraction
