The incorporation of high‐performance optoelectronic devices into photonic neuromorphic processors can substantially accelerate computationally intensive matrix multiplication operations in machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, the conventional designs of individual devices and system are largely disconnected, and the system optimization is limited to the manual exploration of a small design space. Here, a device‐system end‐to‐end design methodology is reported to optimize a …
