The incorporation of highperformance optoelectronic devices into photonic neuromorphic processors can substantially accelerate computationally intensive matrix multiplication operations in machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, the conventional designs of individual devices and system are largely disconnected, and the system optimization is limited to the manual exploration of a small design space. Here, a devicesystem endtoend design methodology is reported to optimize a  Cites: A graph placement methodology for fast chip design
