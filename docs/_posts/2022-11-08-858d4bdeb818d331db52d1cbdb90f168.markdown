Since deep learning models include a wide range of the recent models in both TextQA and KBQA, we introduce the main neural models used in this field in this chapter. We study the neural architectures widely used in Sect. 2.3. 2 and avoid repeating some of the details described in this section in the following chapters. We also describe the available word representation model from traditional and state-of-the-art models that are utilized in QA systems. Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
