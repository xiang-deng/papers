The increasing reliance on ML models in high-stakes tasks has raised a major concern on fairness violations. Although there has been a surge of work that improves algorithmic fairness, most of them are under the assumption of an identical training and test distribution. In many real-world applications, however, such an assumption is often violated as previously trained fair models are often deployed in a different environment, and the fairness of such models has been observed to
