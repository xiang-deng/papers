Visualisation techniques are powerful tools to understand the behaviour of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. They can be used to identify important features contributing to the network decisions, investigate biases in datasets, and find weaknesses in the system s structure (eg, network architectures). Lawmakers and regulators may not allow the use of smart systems if these systems cannot explain the logic underlying a decision or action taken. These systems are required to offer a high level Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
