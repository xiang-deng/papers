Having a high-quality historical air pollutant dataset is critical for environmental and epidemiological research. In this study, a novel deep learning model based on convolutional neural network architecture was developed to estimate ground-level ozone concentrations across eastern China. A high-resolution maximum daily average 8-h (MDA8) surface ground ozone concentration dataset was generated with the support of the total ozone column from the satellite Tropospheric Monitoring Cites: Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for
