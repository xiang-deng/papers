Prior work typically describes out-of-domain (OOD) or out-of-distribution (OODist) samples as those that originate from dataset (s) or source (s) different from the training set but for the same task. When compared to in-domain (ID) samples, the models have been known to usually perform poorer on OOD samples, although this observation is not consistent. Another thread of research has focused on OOD detection, albeit mostly using supervised approaches. In this work, we first …
