Neural Architecture Search has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have gained popularity for the search efficiency. However, they still suffer from three main issues, that are, the weak stability due to the performance collapse, the poor generalization ability of the searched architectures, and the inferior robustness to different kinds of proxies. To solve the stability and generalization problems, a simple-but-effective regularization …
