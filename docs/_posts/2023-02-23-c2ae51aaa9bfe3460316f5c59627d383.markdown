Intelligent deep learning-based models have made significant progress for automated source code semantics embedding, and current research works mainly leverage natural language-based methods and graph-based methods. However, natural language-based methods do not capture the rich semantic structural information of source code, and graph-based methods do not utilize rich distant information of source code due to the high cost of message-passing steps.
