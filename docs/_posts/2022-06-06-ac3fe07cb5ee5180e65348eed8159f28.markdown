In the realm of natural language processing (NLP), paraphrase detection is a highly common and significant activity. Because it is involved in a lot of complicated and complex NLP applications like information retrieval, text mining, and plagiarism detection. The proposed model finds the best combination of the three types of similarity techniques that are string similarity, semantic similarity and embedding similarity. Then, inputs these similarity scores that range from 0 to 1, to the machine  Cites: A comparison of vector-based representations for semantic
