We present a dataset containing source code solutions to algorithmic programming exercises solved by hundreds of Bachelor-level students at the Universitt Hamburg. These solutions were collected during the winter semesters 2019/2020, 2020/2021 and 2021/2022. The dataset contains a set of solutions to a total of 21 tasks written in Java as well as Python and a total of over 1500 individual solutions. All solutions were submitted through Moodle and the Coderunner plugin and passed a number of  Cites: Juice: A large scale distantly supervised dataset for open domain
