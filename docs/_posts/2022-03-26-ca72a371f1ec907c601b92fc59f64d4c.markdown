Hyperspectral images of a scene or object are a rich data source, often encoding a hundred or more spectral bands of reflectance at each pixel. Despite being very high- dimensional, these images typically encode latent low-dimensional structure that can be exploited for material discrimination. However, due to an inherent trade-off between spectral and spatial resolution, many hyperspectral images are generated at a coarse spatial scale, and single pixels may correspond to spatial regions Cites: Semi-supervised graph-based hyperspectral image classification
