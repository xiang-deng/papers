Is there an initialization for deep networks that requires no learning? ExplainFix adopts two design principles: the fixed filters principle that all spatial filter weights of convolutional neural networks can be fixed at initialization and never learned, and the nimbleness principle that only few network parameters suffice. We contribute (a) visual modelbased explanations,(b) speed and accuracy gains, and (c) novel tools for deep convolutional neural networks. ExplainFix gives key insights that spatially Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
