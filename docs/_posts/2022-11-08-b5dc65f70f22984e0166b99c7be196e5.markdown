Few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) task aims to infer missing entities or relations by using few-shot support instances in the knowledge graph. Existing FKGC methods focus on the learning of few-shot relation representations, which are obtained by aggregating the neighbor information of each entity. However, most of these models take the entity s neighbor relations and entities as the same hierarchy and do not make fine-grained distinctions, resulting in entity embeddings with low Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
