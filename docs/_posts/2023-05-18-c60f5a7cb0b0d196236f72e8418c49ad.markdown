Event schema provides a conceptual, structural and formal language to represent events and model the world event knowledge. Unfortunately, it is challenging to automatically induce high-quality and high-coverage event schemas due to the open nature of real-world events, the diversity of event expressions, and the sparsity of event knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for event schema induction--knowledge harvesting from large-scale pre-trained language models  Cites: The future is not one-dimensional: Complex event schema
