Foundation models pre-trained on large corpora demonstrate significant gains across many natural language processing tasks and domains eg, law, healthcare, education, etc. However, only limited efforts have investigated the opportunities and limitations of applying these powerful models to science and security applications. In this work, we develop foundation models of scientific knowledge for chemistry to augment scientists with the advanced ability to perceive and reason at scale Cites: BoolQ: Exploring the Surprising Difficulty of Natural Yes/No
