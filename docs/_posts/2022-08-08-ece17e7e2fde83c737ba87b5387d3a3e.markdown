Adversarial training using empirical risk minimization is the state-of-the-art method for defense against adversarial attacks, that is against small additive adversarial perturbations applied to test data leading to misclassification. Despite being successful in practice, understanding generalization properties of adversarial training in classification remains widely open. In this paper, we take the first step in this direction by precisely characterizing the robustness of adversarial training in Cites: Understanding and mitigating the tradeoff between robustness and
