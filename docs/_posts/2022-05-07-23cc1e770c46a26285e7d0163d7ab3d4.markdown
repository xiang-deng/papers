In the field of bioinformatics, a large number of classical software becomes a necessary research tool. To measure the influence of scientific software as one kind of important intellectual products, a few strategies have been proposed to identify the software names from full texts of papers to collect the usage data of packages in bioinformatics research. However, the performance of these strategies is limited because of the highly imbalance of data in the full texts. This study proposes Cites: Feature-rich part-of-speech tagging with a cyclic dependency
