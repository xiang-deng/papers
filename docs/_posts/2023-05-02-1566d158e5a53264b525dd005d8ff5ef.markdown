We investigate how to enhance answer precision in frequently asked questions posed by distributed users using cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs). Our study focuses on a typical situations where users ask similar queries that involve identical mathematical reasoning steps and problem-solving procedures. Due to the unsatisfactory accuracy of LLMs zero-shot prompting with standalone questions, we propose to improve the distributed synonymous questions using Self-Consistency Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
