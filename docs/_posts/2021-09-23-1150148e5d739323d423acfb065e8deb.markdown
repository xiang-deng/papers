Metal-organic frameworks are crystalline, nanoporous materials formed by metal nodes connected by organic ligands. MOFs represent an exciting approach to materials design where a material with desired properties can be made by choosing the compatible nodes, linkers and topologies independently. MOFs are highly porous and have high surface areas and good thermal and chemical stability, which makes them excellent candidates for adsorption applications. This research explores two Cites: Theoretical limits of hydrogen storage in metalorganic
