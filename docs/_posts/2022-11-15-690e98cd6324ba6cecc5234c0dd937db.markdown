Consistently high data quality is essential for the development of novel loss functions and architectures in the field of deep learning. The existence of such data and labels is usually presumed, while acquiring high-quality datasets is still a major issue in many cases. Subjective annotations by annotators often lead to ambiguous labels in real-world datasets. We propose a data-centric approach to relabel such ambiguous labels instead of implementing the handling of this issue in a neural network.
