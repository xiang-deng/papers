We propose to study and promote the robustness of a model as per its performance through the interpolation of training data distributions. Specifically,(1) we augment the data by finding the worst-case Wasserstein barycenter on the geodesic connecting subpopulation distributions of different categories.(2) We regularize the model for smoother performance on the continuous geodesic path connecting subpopulation distributions.(3) Additionally, we provide a theoretical guarantee of Cites: SSMBA: Self-supervised manifold based data augmentation for
