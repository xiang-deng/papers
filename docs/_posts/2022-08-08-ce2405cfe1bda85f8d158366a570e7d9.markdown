The methodology for constructing intrusion detection systems and improving existing systems is being actively studied in order to detect harmful data within large-capacity network data. The most common approach is to use AI systems to adapt to unanticipated threats and improve system performance. However, most studies aim to improve performance, and performance-oriented systems tend to be composed of black box models, whose internal working is complex.
