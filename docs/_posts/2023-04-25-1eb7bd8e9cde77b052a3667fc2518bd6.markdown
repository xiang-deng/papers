This paper considers the pseudocode-to-code generation task. Training the pseudocode-to-code generation model requires a set of labeled (pseudocode, code) pairs. However, manually annotated data pairs are costly. It is also timeconsuming to check and correct annotation errors in the annotation process. This paper proposes a novel Select-ThemRepair-Them (STRT) approach to select and repair pseudocode annotation errors to optimize data, which is able to explore pseudocode-to-code  Cites: Coarse-to-fine decoding for neural semantic parsing
