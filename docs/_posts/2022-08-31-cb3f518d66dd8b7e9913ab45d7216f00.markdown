We consider extractive summarization within a cluster of related texts (multi-document summarization). Unlike single-document summarization, redundancy is particularly important because sentences across related documents might convey overlapping information. Thus, sentence extraction in such a setting is difficult because one will need to determine which pieces of information are relevant while avoiding unnecessary repetitiveness. To solve this difficult problem, we propose a  Cites: A thorough examination of the CNN/Daily Mail reading
