Recent advances in large pre-trained language models have demonstrated strong results in generating natural languages and significantly improved performances for many natural language generation (NLG) applications such as machine translation and text summarization. However, when the generation tasks are more open-ended and the content is under-specified, existing techniques struggle to generate long-term coherent and creative content. Moreover, the models exhibit and even amplify …
