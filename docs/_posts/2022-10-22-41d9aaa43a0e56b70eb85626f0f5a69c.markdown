Abstract Explainable Machine Learning (ML) is an emerging field of Artificial Intelligence that has gained popularity in the last decade. It focuses on explaining ML models and their predictions, enabling people to understand the rationale behind them. Counterfactuals and semifactuals are two instances of Explainable ML techniques that explain model predictions using other observations. These techniques are based on the comparison between the observation to be explained …
