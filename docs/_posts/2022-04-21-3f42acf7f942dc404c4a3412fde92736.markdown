The primary goal of this research is to automatically generate novel metaphors, where a generated metaphor can be interpreted by humans and based on a topic provided as input to the generator. This research is motivated by the idea that metaphors can inspire people with fresh, creative thoughts, and foster greater trust between humans and machines by making the machines more creative and human- like in their use of language.
