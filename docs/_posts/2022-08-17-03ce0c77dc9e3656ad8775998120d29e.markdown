Graph neural networks (GNN) are powerful tools in many web research problems. However, existing GNNs are not fully suitable for many real-world web applications. For example, over-smoothing may affect personalized recommendations and the lack of an explanation for the GNN prediction hind the understanding of many business scenarios. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a new second-order continuous GNN which naturally avoids over-smoothing and enjoys Cites: Multi-task identification of entities, relations, and coreference for
