Identifying and repairing the erroneous and missing information in the graphs is crucial. Rule-based studies rely on graph quality rules to detect the inconsistencies among different entities and make a one-time repair to resolve these inconsistencies. The missing data can be predicted and imputed by graph embedding methods by preserving the inherent structure of a reliable graph. However, both lines of way need more evidence to improve. In this paper, we propose Grier, a novel repairing …
