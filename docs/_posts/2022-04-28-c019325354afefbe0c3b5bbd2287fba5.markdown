Explainability is one of the key factors in Natural Language Processing (NLP) specially for legal documents, medical diagnosis, and clinical text. Attention mechanism has been a popular choice for such explainability recently by estimating the relative importance of input units. Recent research has revealed, however, that such processes tend to misidentify irrelevant input units when explaining them. This is due to the fact that language representation layers are initialized by pre-trained Cites: Glove: Global vectors for word representation
