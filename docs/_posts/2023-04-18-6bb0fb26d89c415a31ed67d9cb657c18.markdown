We introduce injective semantics for Conjunctive Regular Path Queries (CRPQs), and study their fundamental properties. We identify two such semantics: atom-injective and query-injective semantics, both defined in terms of injective homomorphisms. These semantics are natural generalizations of the well-studied class of RPQs under simple-path semantics to the class of CRPQs. We study their evaluation and containment problems, providing useful characterizations for them Cites: Query containment for conjunctive queries with regular expressions
