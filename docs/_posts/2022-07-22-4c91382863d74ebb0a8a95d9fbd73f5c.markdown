Optimal transport (OT) theory describes general principles to define and select, among many possible choices, the most efficient way to map a probability measure onto another. That theory has been mostly used to estimate, given a pair of source and target probability measures $(\mu,\nu) $, a parameterized map $ T_\theta $ that can efficiently map $\mu $ onto $\nu $. In many applications, such as predicting cell responses to treatments, the data measures $\mu,\nu $(features of untreated/treated Cites: Linguistic regularities in continuous space word representations
