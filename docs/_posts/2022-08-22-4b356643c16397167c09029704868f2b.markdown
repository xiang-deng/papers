Benchmark datasets play an important role in evaluating Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models. However, shortcuts--unwanted biases in the benchmark datasets--can damage the effectiveness of benchmark datasets in revealing models real capabilities. Since shortcuts vary in coverage, productivity, and semantic meaning, it is challenging for NLU experts to systematically understand and avoid them when creating benchmark datasets. In this paper, we develop a Cites: Wanli: Worker and ai collaboration for natural language inference
