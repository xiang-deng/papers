Entity alignment (EA) which links equivalent entities across different knowledge graphs (KGs) plays a crucial role in knowledge fusion. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied in many embedding-based EA methods. However, existing GNN-based methods either suffer from the structural heterogeneity issue that especially appears in the real KG distributions or ignore the heterogeneous representation learning for unseen (unlabeled) entities, which would  Cites: Exploring and Evaluating Attributes, Values, and Structures for
