State-machine replication protocols represent the foundation of many fault-tolerant services. Unfortunately, their inherent complexity makes existing implementations notoriously difficult to debug and test. To address this problem, we propose a novel design approach, micro replication, whose main goal is to reduce bugs and enable replication protocols with improved debuggability properties. At its core, our concept consists of a set of principles that, if followed during protocol design, later Cites: Sledgehammer: Cluster-Fueled Debugging.
