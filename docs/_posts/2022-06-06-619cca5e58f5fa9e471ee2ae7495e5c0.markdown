Discovering visual representation in an image category is a challenging issue, because the visual representation should not only be discriminative but also frequently appears in these images. Previous studies have proposed many solutions, however, all of them separately optimized the discrimination and frequency, which consequently makes the solutions sub-optimal. We propose a method to discover the jointly discriminative and frequent visual representation to address this issue, named …
