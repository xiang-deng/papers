Recent work has shown that large language models are capable of generating natural language reasoning steps or Chains-of-Thoughts (CoT) to answer a multi-step question when prompted to do so. This is insufficient, however, when the necessary knowledge is not available or up-to-date within a model s parameters. A straightforward approach to address this is to retrieve text from an external knowledge source using the question as a query and prepend it as context to the  Cites: RealTime QA: What s the Answer Right Now?
