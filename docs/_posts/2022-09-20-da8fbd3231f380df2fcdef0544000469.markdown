In the last few years, the natural language processing community witnessed advances in neural representations of free texts with transformer-based language models (LMs). Given the importance of knowledge available in relational tables, recent research efforts extend LMs by developing neural representations for tabular data. In this tutorial, we present these proposals with two main goals. First, we introduce to a database audience the potentials and the limitations of current models  Cites: Database reasoning over text
