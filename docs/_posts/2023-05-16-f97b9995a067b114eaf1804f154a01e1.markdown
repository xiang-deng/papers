Legal case retrieval techniques play an essential role in modern intelligent legal systems. As an annually well-known international competition, COLIEE is aiming to achieve the state-of-the-art retrieval model for legal texts. This paper summarizes the approach of the championship team THUIR in COLIEE 2023. To be specific, we design structure-aware pre-trained language models to enhance the understanding of legal cases. Furthermore, we propose heuristic pre-processing and post …
