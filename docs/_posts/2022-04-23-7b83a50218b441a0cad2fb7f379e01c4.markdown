Learning program representations has been the core prerequisite of code intelligent tasks such as code search and code clone detection. The state-of-the-art pre-trained models such as CodeBERT require the availability of large-scale code corpora. However, gathering training samples can be costly and infeasible for domain-specific languages such as Solidity for smart contracts. In this paper, we propose Zecoler, a zero-shot learning approach for code representations. Zecoler is built upon a pre Cites: Dawn Drain
