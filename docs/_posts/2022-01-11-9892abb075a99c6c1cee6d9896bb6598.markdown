As one of the core tasks in the field of natural language processing, syntactic analysis has always been a hot topic for researchers, including tasks such as Questions and Answer (Q&A), Search String Comprehension, Semantic Analysis, and Knowledge Base Construction. This paper aims to study the application of deep learning and neural network in natural language syntax analysis, which has significant research and application value. This paper first studies a transfer-based Cites: Linguistic regularities in continuous space word representations
