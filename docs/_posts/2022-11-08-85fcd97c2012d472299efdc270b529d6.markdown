Event extraction aims to extract structured triggers and arguments from unstructured text. However, the accuracy of named entity recognition will directly affect the performance of event argument role recognition, which results in error propagation. Meanwhile, treating the event extraction task as a classification task ignores semantic information in sentences. In the paper, we propose a dual machine reading comprehension model (Dual-MRC) for event extraction, which converts the  Cites: Event time extraction and propagation via graph attention networks
