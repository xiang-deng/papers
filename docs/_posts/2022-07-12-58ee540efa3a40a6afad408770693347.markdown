Arti cial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have t the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many de ning characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much di erent pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches.
