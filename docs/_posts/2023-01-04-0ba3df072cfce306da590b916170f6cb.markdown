In this research, we aim to explore the potential of natural language models (NLMs) such as GPT-3 and GPT-2 to generate effective phishing emails. Phishing emails are fraudulent messages that aim to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or taking actions that benefit the attackers. We propose a framework for evaluating the performance of NLMs in generating these types of emails based on various criteria, including the quality of the generated text, the ability to bypass spam filters …
