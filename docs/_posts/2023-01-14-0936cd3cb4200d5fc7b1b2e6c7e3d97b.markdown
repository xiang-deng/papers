Code completion has become a common practice for programmers during their daily programming activities. It aims at automatically predicting the next tokens or lines that the programmers tend to use. A good code completion tool can substantially save keystrokes and improve the programming efficiency for programmers. Recently, various techniques for code completion have been proposed for usage in practice. However, it is still unclear what are practitioners expectations on code completion  Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
