Prompt-based learning reformulates downstream tasks as cloze problems by combining the original input with a template. This technique is particularly useful in few-shot learning, where a model is trained on a limited amount of data. However, the limited templates and text used in few-shot prompt-based learning still leave significant room for performance improvement. Additionally, existing methods using model ensembles can constrain the model efficiency. To address these issues, we Cites: Universal adversarial triggers for attacking and analyzing NLP
