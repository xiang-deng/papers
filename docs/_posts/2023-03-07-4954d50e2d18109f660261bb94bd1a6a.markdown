A key difficulty in training task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems is a lack of training data. We explore the possibility of creating new dialogue data through the interaction of an end-to-end (E2E) Transformer-based TOD system, and an E2E Transformer-based User Simulator. We refer to the generation of new data through conversations between the two systems as self-play. Our goal is to develop such a TOD system and User Simulator using supervised learning that a) can operate on unseen dialogues …
