Large deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in many scenarios. However, training large models is usually challenging, eg, due to the high computational cost, the unstable and painfully slow optimization procedure, and the vulnerability to overfitting. To alleviate these problems, this work studies a divide-and-conquer strategy, ie, dividing a large model into smaller modules, training them independently, and reassembling the trained modules to obtain the target model  Cites: Coatnet: Marrying convolution and attention for all data sizes
