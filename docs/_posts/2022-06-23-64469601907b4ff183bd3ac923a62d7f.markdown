The semantics of relations are crucial for comprehending and analyzing multi-relational data. Polysemous relations between different types of entities (ie those that represent multiple semantics) are common in real-world relational datasets represented by knowledge graphs. For numerous use cases, such as entity type classification, question answering and knowledge graph completion, the correct semantic interpretation of these relations is necessary. In this work, we provide a …
