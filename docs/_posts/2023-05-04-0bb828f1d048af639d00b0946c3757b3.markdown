Advances in the Visually-rich Document Understanding (VrDU) field and particularly the Key-Information Extraction (KIE) task are marked with the emergence of efficient Transformer-based approaches such as the LayoutLM models. Despite the good performance of KIE models when fine-tuned on public benchmarks, they still struggle to generalize on complex real-life use-cases lacking sufficient document annotations. Our research highlighted that KIE standard benchmarks such as SROIE and FUNSD  Cites: RoBERTa: a robustly optimized BERT pretraining approach (2019)
