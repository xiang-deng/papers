In this paper, the optimization of semantic communications over energy harvesting networks is studied. In the considered model, a set of users use semantic communication techniques and the harvested energy to transmit text data to a base station (BS). Here, semantic communication techniques enable each user to transmit the meaning of the original data (called semantic information) thereby reducing its transmission delay and energy consumption. The BS will recover the data using the Cites: Text generation from knowledge graphs with graph transformers
