Large language models (LMs) have shown impressive performance on many language understanding tasks. However, the high accuracy achieved by LMs is evaluated on end tasks, which does not imply the model s ability in language understanding and reasoning. Tiered Reasoning for Intuitive Physics (TRIP)(Storks et al., 2021) is a commonsense reasoning dataset proposed to evaluate the multitiered performance of machines reasoning processes. The empirical results on  Cites: Logic-guided data augmentation and regularization for consistent
