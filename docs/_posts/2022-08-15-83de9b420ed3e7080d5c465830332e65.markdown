As data sources become ever more numerous with increased feature dimensionality, feature selection for multiview data has become an important technique in machine learning. Semi-supervised multiview feature selection (SMFS) focuses on the problem of how to obtain a discriminative feature subset from heterogeneous feature spaces in the case of abundant unlabeled data with little labeled data. Most existing methods suffer from unreliable similarity graph structure across different views since Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
