Query encoding (QE) is proposed as a fast and robust solution to CQA. In the encoding process, most existing QE methods first parse the logical query into an executable computational direct-acyclic graph (DAG), then use neural networks to parameterize the operators, and finally, recursively execute these neuralized operators. However, the parameterization-and-execution paradigm may be potentially over-complicated, as it can be structurally simplified by a single neural Cites: Smore: Knowledge graph completion and multi-hop reasoning in
