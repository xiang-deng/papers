Knowledge graph completion can complete knowledge by predicting missing facts, which is a increasingly hot research topic in knowledge graph construction. Prevalent approaches propose to embed knowledge graphs in a lowdimensional vector space and use these embedding to predict, but they neglect either semantic information or graph structures. We propose a new approach to knowledge graph completion named as ATTWALK, which learns embedding by exploiting both Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
