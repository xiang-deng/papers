Self-assessment rules play an essential role in safe and effective real-world robotic applications, which verify the feasibility of the selected action before actual execution. But how to utilize the self-assessment results to re-choose actions remains a challenge. Previous methods eliminate the selected action evaluated as failed by the self-assessment rules, and re-choose one with the next-highest affordance~(ie process-of-elimination strategy [1]), which ignores the dependency Cites: Decoupled exploration and exploitation policies for sample
