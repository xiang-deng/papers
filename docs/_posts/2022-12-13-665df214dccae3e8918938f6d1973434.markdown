Multi-label ranking maps instances to a ranked set of predicted labels from multiple possible classes. The ranking approach for multi-label learning problems received attention for its success in multi-label classification, with one of the well-known approaches being pairwise label ranking. However, most existing methods assume that only partial information about the preference relation is known, which is inferred from the partition of labels into a positive and negative set, then treat labels with Cites: Constraint classification for multiclass classification and ranking
