While mislabeled or ambiguously-labeled samples in the training set could negatively affect the performance of deep models, diagnosing the dataset and identifying mislabeled samples helps to improve the generalization power. Training dynamics, ie, the traces left by iterations of optimization algorithms, have recently been proved to be effective to localize mislabeled samples with hand-crafted features. In this paper, beyond manually designed features, we introduce a novel  Cites: Dataset cartography: Mapping and diagnosing datasets with
