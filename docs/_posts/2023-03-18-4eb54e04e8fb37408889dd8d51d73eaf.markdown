ABSTRACT AbstractBasic research in Cognitive Informatics (CI) and Cognitive Computing (CC) provides fundamental theories of intelligence science for Autonomous AI (AAI) and cognitive systems. The field of CI and CC has led to general AI technologies triggered by the transdisciplinary advances in brain, intelligence, computer, knowledge, cognitive, robotic, and cybernetic sciences for engineering implementations. This paper presents a summary report of the plenary  Cites: Experience grounds language
