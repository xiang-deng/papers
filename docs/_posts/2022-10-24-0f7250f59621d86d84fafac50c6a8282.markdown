The increasingly growing scale of modern computing infrastructures solicits more ingenious and automatic solutions to their management. Our work focuses on file transfer failures within the Worldwide Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid and proposes a pipeline to support distributed data management operations by suggesting potential issues to investigate. Specifically, we adopt an unsupervised learning approach leveraging Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning …
