It has long been known that queries over GTGDs can be answered by a variant of the chasea quintessential technique for reasoning with dependencies. However, there has been little work on concrete algorithms and even less on implementation. To address this gap, we revisit Datalog rewriting approaches to query answering, where GTGDs are transformed to a Cites: Data integration: The teenage years
