Deep learning has revolutionized many areas of machine learning, from computer vision to natural language processing, but these high-performance models are generally  black box.  Explaining such models would improve transparency and trust in AI-powered decision making and is necessary for understanding other practical needs such as robustness and fairness. A popular means of enhancing model transparency is to quantify how individual inputs contribute to model outputs (called …
