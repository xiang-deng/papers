Textual adversarial attacks expose the vulnerabilities of text classifiers and can be used to improve their robustness. Existing context-aware methods solely consider the gold label probability and use the greedy search when searching an attack path, often limiting the attack efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose PDBS, a context-aware textual adversarial attack model using Probability Difference guided Beam Search. The probability difference is an overall consideration of all class label Cites: Universal adversarial triggers for attacking and analyzing NLP
