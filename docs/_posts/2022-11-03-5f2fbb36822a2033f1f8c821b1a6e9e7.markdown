Point cloud data is ubiquitous in scientific fields. Recently, geometric deep learning (GDL) has been widely applied to solve prediction tasks with such data. However, GDL models are often complicated and hardly interpretable, which poses concerns to scientists when deploying these models in scientific analysis and experiments. This work proposes a general mechanism named learnable randomness injection (LRI), which allows building inherently interpretable models based on general GDL  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
