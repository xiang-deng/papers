Conventional event detection models under supervised learning settings suffer from the inability of transfer to newly-emerged event types owing to lack of sufficient annotations. A commonly-adapted solution is to follow a identify-then-classify manner, which first identifies the triggers and then converts the classification task via a few-shot learning paradigm. However, these methods still fall far short of expectations due to:(i) insufficient learning of discriminative representations in low Cites: A language-independent neural network for event detection
