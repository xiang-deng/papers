In this paper, we study the dynamic transfer learning problem involving adaptive knowledge transfer from a static source domain to a time evolving target domain. One major challenge is the time evolving relatedness of the source domain and the current target domain as the target domain evolves over time. To address this challenge, we derive a generic error bound on the current target domain with flexible domain discrepancy measures. Moreover, we propose a label-informed $\mathcal  Cites: Understanding self-training for gradual domain adaptation
