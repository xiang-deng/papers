Great endeavors have been made to study AI s ability in abstract reasoning, along with which different versions of RAVEN s progressive matrices (RPM) are proposed as benchmarks. Previous works give inkling that without sophisticated design or extra meta-data containing semantic information, neural networks may still be indecisive in making decisions regarding RPM problems, after relentless training. Evidenced by thorough experiments and ablation studies, we showcase that end-to  Cites: Self-consistency improves chain of thought reasoning in language
