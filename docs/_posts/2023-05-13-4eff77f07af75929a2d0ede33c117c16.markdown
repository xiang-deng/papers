We propose a novel approach for developing privacy-preserving large-scale recommender systems using differentially private (DP) large language models (LLMs) which overcomes certain challenges and limitations in DP training these complex systems. Our method is particularly well suited for the emerging area of LLM-based recommender systems, but can be readily employed for any recommender systems that process representations of natural language inputs. Our approach  Cites: Ctrl: A conditional transformer language model for controllable
