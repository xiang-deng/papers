Learning and identifying key concepts from past fault records are essential for us to understand the causes of these faults, which lay the foundation for the fault diagnosis and prognosis. At present, faults in many fields (eg, rail, automobile, and smart grid) are recorded in textual form. Due to the lack of effective mining and analysis tools, latent information in the massive textual data (text records) has not been fully unearthed. In this paper, a novel Adversarial Training-based Lattice LSTM model …
