The design of effective multi-view subspace clustering (MSC) algorithms has recently garnered significant research attention. Herein, to effectively improve the recognition performance and anti-noise interference ability of an MSC model, we propose a novel MSC algorithm, termed as robust multi-view subspace enhancement representation, based on collaborative constraints and a HilbertSchmidt independence criterion (HSIC) induction method.
