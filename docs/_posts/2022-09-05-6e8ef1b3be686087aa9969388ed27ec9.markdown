The abundance of energy consumption data collected by smart meters has inspired researchers to employ deep neural networks to solve the existing problems in the power industry, such as Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF). Most studies addressing the STLF problem, focus on historical load data and to achieve higher performance, they supplement costly accessible environmental and calendar variables with data. This approach ignores the existing spatial information among the Cites: Load forecasting using support vector machines: A study on
