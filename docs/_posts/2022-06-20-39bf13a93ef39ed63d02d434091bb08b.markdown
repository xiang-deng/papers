In this deliverable we describe the final automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems that we created for the ELITR speech translation system. In Section 2 we describe our work. In the subsections 2.1 and 2.2 we address tasks T2. 1 (Robustness of Acoustic Model) and T2. 2 (Unsupervised/Semi-Supervised Adaptation of Language Models), respectively. We developed an online low-latency automatic speech recognition system with super-human performance. Furthermore, we investigated …
