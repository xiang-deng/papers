With the growth of machine learning for structured data, the need for reliable model explanations is essential, especially in high-stakes applications. We introduce a novel framework, Interpretable Mixture of Experts (IME), that provides interpretability for structured data while preserving accuracy. IME consists of an assignment module and a mixture of interpretable experts such as linear models where each sample is assigned to a single interpretable expert. This results in an inherently-interpretable
