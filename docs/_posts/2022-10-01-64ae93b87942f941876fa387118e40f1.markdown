Supervised learning algorithms are heavily reliant on annotated datasets to train machine learning models. However, the curation of the annotated datasets is laborious and time consuming due to the manual effort involved and has become a huge bottleneck in supervised learning. In this work, we apply the theory of noisy learning to generate weak supervision signals instead of manual annotation. We curate a noisy labeled dataset using a labeling heuristic to identify epidemic related …
