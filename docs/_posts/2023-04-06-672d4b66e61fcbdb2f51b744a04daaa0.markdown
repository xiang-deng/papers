Analogical inference is a remarkable capability of human reasoning, and has been used to solve hard reasoning tasks. Analogy based reasoning (AR) has gained increasing interest from the artificial intelligence community and has shown its potential in multiple machine learning tasks such as classification, decision making and recommendation with competitive results. We propose a deep learning (DL) framework to address and tackle two key tasks in AR: analogy detection and solving  Cites: Linguistic regularities in continuous space word representations
