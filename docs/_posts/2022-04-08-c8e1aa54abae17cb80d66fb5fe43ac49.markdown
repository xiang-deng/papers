While Visual Question Answering (VQA) has progressed rapidly, previous works raise concerns about robustness of current VQA models. In this work, we study the robustness of VQA models from a novel perspective: visual context. We suggest that the models over-rely on the visual context, ie, irrelevant objects in the image, to make predictions. To diagnose the model s reliance on visual context and measure their robustness, we propose a simple yet effective perturbation technique, SwapMix Cites: Oscar: Object-semantics aligned pre-training for vision-language
