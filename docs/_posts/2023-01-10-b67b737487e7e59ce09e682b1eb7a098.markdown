Application of the replica exchange (ie, parallel tempering) technique to Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms, especially stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), has scored great success in non-convex learning problems, but one potential limitation is the computational cost caused by running multiple chains. Upon observing that a large variance of the gradient estimator in SGLD essentially increases the temperature of the stationary distribution, we propose expediting Cites: A hitting time analysis of stochastic gradient langevin dynamics
