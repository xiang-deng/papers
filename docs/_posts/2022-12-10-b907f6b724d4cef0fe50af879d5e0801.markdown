There has been significant progress in creating machine learning models that identify objects in scenes along with their associated attributes and relationships; however, there is a large gap between the best models and human capabilities. One of the major reasons for this gap is the difficulty in collecting sufficient amounts of annotated relations and attributes for training these systems. While some attributes and relations are abundant, the distribution in the natural world and existing datasets  Cites: Reasoning With Neural Tensor Networks for Knowledge Base
