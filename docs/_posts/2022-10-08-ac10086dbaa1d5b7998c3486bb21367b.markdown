Knowledge Graphs (KGs) often have two characteristics: heterogeneous graph structure and text-rich entity/relation information. KG representation models should consider graph structures and text semantics, but no comprehensive open-sourced framework is mainly designed for KG regarding informative text description. In this paper, we present PromptKG, a prompt learning framework for KG representation learning and application that equips the cutting-edge text-based methods, integrates …
