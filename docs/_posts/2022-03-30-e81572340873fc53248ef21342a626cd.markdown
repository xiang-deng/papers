Real-world problems such as human activity recognition and gesture recognition involve time series data. However, in the case of human activity recognition, for example, a machine learning model trained on one person s data may not perform well on another person s data due to different activity patterns, sensor positions, or sampling rates. This poses a problem, requiring data annotations to be collected for each person individually. Yet collecting such labels for time series may be expensive Cites: Domain agnostic real-valued specificity prediction
