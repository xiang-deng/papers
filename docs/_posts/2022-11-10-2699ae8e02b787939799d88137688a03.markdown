Automatic keyphrases extraction (AKE) is a principal task in natural language processing (NLP). Several techniques have been exploited to improve the process of extracting keyphrases from documents. Deep learning (DL) algorithms are the latest techniques used in prediction and extraction of keyphrases. DL is one of the most complex types of machine learning, relying on the use of artificial neural networks to make the machine follow the same decision-making path as the human brain.
