After obtaining high quality concepts, the next step toward automated taxonomy discovery is to organize them into a hierarchical structure. In this chapter, we first discuss various types of taxonomy construction approaches and then present an iterative hierarchical expansion framework. This framework effectively leverages user-input guidances to construct a task-specific concept taxonomy. After that, we discuss the experiment findings and conclude this chapter with some interesting future Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
