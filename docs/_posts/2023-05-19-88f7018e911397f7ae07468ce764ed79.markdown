Prior work has combined chain-of-thought prompting in large language models (LLMs) with programmatic representations to perform effective and transparent reasoning. While such an approach works very well for tasks that only require forward reasoning (eg, straightforward arithmetic), it is less effective for constraint solving tasks that require more sophisticated planning and search. In this paper, we propose a new satisfiability-aided language modeling approach for improving the  Cites: Demystifying prompts in language models via perplexity estimation
