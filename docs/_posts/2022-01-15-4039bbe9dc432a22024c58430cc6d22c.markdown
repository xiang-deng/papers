The performance of relation extraction (RE) is hindered by the lack of sufficient labeled data. Semisupervised methods can offer to help hands with this problem by augmenting high-quality unlabeled samples into the training data. However, existing semisupervised RE methods either need a set of manually defined rules or rely on the classifier trained on the small labeled data, ie, the former requires the heavy intervention of human knowledge, and the latter is bound to the number and the Cites: Cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction with graph lstms
