Language models (LMs) are shown to have commonsense knowledge of the physical world, which is fundamental for completing tasks in everyday situations. However, it is still an open question whether LMs have the ability to generate grounded, executable plans for embodied tasks. It is very challenging because LMs do not have an eye or hand to perceive the realistic environment. In this work, we show the first study on this important research question. We first present a novel Cites: CommonGen: A constrained text generation challenge for
