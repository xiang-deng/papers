Deep learning technologies have brought us many models that outperform human beings on a few benchmarks. An interesting question is: can these models well solve real-world problems with similar settings (eg, same input/output) to the benchmark datasets? We argue that a model is trained to answer the same information need for which the training dataset is created. Although some datasets may share high structural similarities, eg, question-answer pairs for the question answering (QA) task  Cites: Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research
