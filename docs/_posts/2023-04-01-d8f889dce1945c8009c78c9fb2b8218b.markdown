Large language models (LMs) such as GPT-4 are very powerful and can process different kinds of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, it can be difficult to interpret the results due to the multi-layer nonlinear model structure and millions of parameters. Lack of understanding of how the model works can make the model unreliable and dangerous for everyday users in real-world scenarios. Most recent works exploit the weights of attention to provide explanations for model …
