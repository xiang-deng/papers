Dialogue systems is an increasingly popular task of natural language processing. However, the dialogue paths tend to be deterministic, restricted to the system rails, regardless of the given request or input text. Recent advances in program synthesis have led to systems which can synthesize programs from very general search spaces, eg Programming by Example, and to systems with very accessible interfaces for writing programs, eg text-to-code translation, but have not achieved both of these Cites: Task-oriented dialogue as dataflow synthesis
