Generics express generalizations about the world (eg,  birds can fly ). However, they are not universally true--while sparrows and penguins are both birds, only sparrows can fly and penguins cannot. Commonsense knowledge bases, which are used extensively in many NLP tasks as a source of world-knowledge, can often encode generic knowledge but, by-design, cannot encode such exceptions. Therefore, it is crucial to realize the specific instances when a generic statement is true or false. In  Cites: NeuroLogic A* esque Decoding: Constrained Text Generation with
