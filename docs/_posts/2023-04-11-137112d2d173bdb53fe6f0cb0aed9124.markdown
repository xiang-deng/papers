The successes of deep learning for semantic segmentation can in be, in part, attributed to its scale: a notion that encapsulates the largeness of these computational architectures and the labeled datasets they are trained on. These resource requirements hinder the applicability of segmentation networks to scenarios where labeled data is expensive, or deployment conditions do not allow for large networks. This dissertation aims at assuaging these problems by (a) transferring the …
