In this paper we generalize single-relation pseudo-Riemannian graph embedding models to multi-relational networks, and show that the typical approach of encoding relations as manifold transformations translates from the Riemannian to the pseudo-Riemannian case. In addition we construct a view of relations as separate spacetime submanifolds of multi-time manifolds, and consider an interpolation between a pseudo-Riemannian embedding model and its Wick-rotated Riemannian …
