Program representation learning is a fundamental task in software engineering applications. With the availability of big code and the development of deep learning techniques, various program representation learning models have been proposed to understand the semantic properties of programs and applied on different software engineering tasks. However, no previous study has comprehensively assessed the generalizability of these deep models on different tasks, so that the pros and cons of Cites: Dawn Drain, Daxin Jiang, Duyu Tang, et al. 2021.
