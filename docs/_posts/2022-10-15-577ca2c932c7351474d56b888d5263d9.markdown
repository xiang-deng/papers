Biaffine method is a strong and efficient method for graph-based dependency parsing. However, previous work only used the biaffine method at the end of the dependency parser as a scorer, and its application in multi-layer form is ignored. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer pseudo-Siamese biaffine model for neural dependency parsing. In this model, we modify the biaffine method so that it can be utilized in multi-layer form, and use pseudo-Siamese biaffine module to construct arc …
