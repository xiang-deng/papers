Deep learning has become a powerful tool for Mars exploration. Mars terrain segmentation is an important Martian vision task, which is the base of rover autonomous planning and safe driving. However, existing deep-learning-based terrain segmentation methods face two problems: one is the lack of sufficient detailed and high-confidence annotations, and the other is the over-reliance of models on annotated training data. In this paper, we address these two problems from the  Cites: VIMPAC: Video Pre-Training via Masked Token Prediction and
