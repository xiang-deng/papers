Answer natural language questions on knowledge bases (KBQA) has attracted wide attention. Several techniques have been developed for answering simple questions. These techniques mostly rely on deep networks to perform classification for relation prediction. Nowadays, contrastive learning has shown its powers in improving performances of classification, while most prior techniques do not gain benefit from this. In light of these, we propose a novel approach to answering simple questions on  Cites: Semantic parsing with syntax-and table-aware sql generation
