Extracting information from documents containing quantitative data in tabular format is an important but still unsolved task due to the heterogeneity of document layouts. This work aims to take a step toward developing a solution to this problem. This paper proposes a flexible, hybrid table extraction system consisting of a deep learning-based table detection module, a heuristic-based structure recognition method, and a graph-based semantic interpretation component.
