Prognostics aid in the longevity of fielded systems or products. Quantifying the system s current health enable prognosis to enhance the operator s decision-making to preserve the system s health. Creating a prognosis for a system can be difficult due to (a) unknown physical relationships and/or (b) irregularities in data appearing well beyond the initiation of a problem. Traditionally, three different modeling paradigms have been used to develop a prognostics model: physics-based (PbM), data-driven Cites: Ask me anything: Dynamic memory networks for natural language
