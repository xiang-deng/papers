We propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) assumption--the high separation probability (HSP) assumption--that is complementary to the common low density separation (LDS) assumption, and a highly accurate and efficient SSL algorithm, the transductive minimax probability machine (TMPM). Under the HSP assumption, a preferred classifier should ensure that with high probability the samples are far away from the decision boundary. Similarly, the LDS assumption Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
