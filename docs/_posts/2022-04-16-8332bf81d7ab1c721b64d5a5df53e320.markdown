Relation Extraction in the biomedical domain is challenging due to the lack of labeled data and high annotation costs, needing domain experts. Distant supervision is commonly used as a way to tackle the scarcity of annotated data by automatically pairing knowledge graph relationships with raw texts. Distantly Supervised Biomedical Relation Extraction (Bio-DSRE) models can seemingly produce very accurate results in several benchmarks. However, given the challenging nature of Cites: Language models as knowledge bases?
