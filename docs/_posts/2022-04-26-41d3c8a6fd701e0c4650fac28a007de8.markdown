Both humans and machines learn the meaning of unknown words through contextual information in a sentence, but not all contexts are equally helpful for learning. We introduce an effective method for capturing the level of contextual informativeness with respect to a given target word. Our study makes three main contributions. First, we develop models for estimating contextual informativeness, focusing on the instructional aspect of sentences. Our attention-based approach using pre-trained Cites: How can we know what language models know?
