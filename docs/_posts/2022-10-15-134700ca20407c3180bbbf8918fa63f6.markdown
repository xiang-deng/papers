Presuppositions are assumptions that are taken for granted by an utterance, and identifying them is key to a pragmatic interpretation of language. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of transformer models to perform NLI on cases involving presupposition. First, we present simple heuristics to create alternative contrastive test cases based on the ImpPres dataset and investigate the model performance on those test cases. Second, to better understand how the model is making its  Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
