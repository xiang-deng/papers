The majority of existing post-hoc explanation approaches for machine learning models produce independent per-variable feature attribution scores, ignoring a critical characteristic, such as the inter-variable relationship between features that naturally occurs in visual and textual data. In response, we develop a novel model-agnostic and permutation-based feature attribution algorithm based on the relational analysis between input variables. As a result, we are able to gain a broader insight Cites: The Out-of-Distribution Problem in Explainability and Search
