Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in the semi-supervised node classification task, where a key point lies in how to sufficiently leverage the limited but valuable label information. Most of the classical GNNs solely use the known labels for computing the classification loss at the output. In recent years, several methods have been designed to additionally utilize the labels at the input. One part of the methods augment the node features via concatenating or adding  Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
