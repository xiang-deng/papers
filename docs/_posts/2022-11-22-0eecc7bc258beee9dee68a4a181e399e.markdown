Training machines to understand natural language and interact with humans is one of the major goals of artificial intelligence. Recent years have witnessed an evolution from matching networks to pretrained language models (PrLMs). In contrast to the plain-text modeling as the focus of the PrLMs, dialog texts involve multiple speakers and reflect special characteristics, such as topic transitions and structure dependencies, between distant utterances. However, the related PrLM models …
