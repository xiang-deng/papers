This paper proposes five indicators to evaluate the effectiveness and viability for adverse glycemic events detection based on predicted blood glucose (BG) values. False negative rate (FNR) and false positive rate (FPR) are defined to evaluate whether it can detect adverse glycemic events (AGEs) based on the predicted value. The temporal overlap (TO) and time difference (TD) are proposed to evaluate whether the predicted model can capture the accurate time duration of AGEs.
