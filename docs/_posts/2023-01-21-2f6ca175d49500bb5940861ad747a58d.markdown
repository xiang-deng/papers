Hypergraph Horn functions were introduced as a subclass of Horn functions that can be represented by a collection of circular implication rules. These functions possess distinguished structural and computational properties. In particular, their characterizations in terms of implicate-duality and the closure operator provide extensions of matroid duality and the Mac Lane-Steinitz exchange property of matroid closure, respectively. In the present paper, we introduce a subclass of Cites: Reasoning with models
