Multi-vector retrieval methods combine the merits of sparse (eg BM25) and dense (eg DPR) retrievers and have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various retrieval tasks. These methods, however, are orders of magnitude slower and need much more space to store their indices compared to their single-vector counterparts. In this paper, we unify different multi-vector retrieval models from a token routing viewpoint and propose conditional token interaction via dynamic lexical routing …
