Online feeds are streamed continuously in batches with varied polarities at varying times. The system handling the online feeds must be trained to classify all the varying polarities occurring dynamically. The polarity classification system designed for the online feeds must address two significant challenges: i) stability-plasticity, ii) category- proliferation. The challenges faced in the polarity classification of online feeds can be addressed using the technique of incremental learning, which serves to learn new Cites: Deep learning in sentiment analysis
