Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding for machine translation is getting renewed attention as it is a principled approach to neural machine translation that exhibits fewer pathologies than the widely adopted maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding. Estimating the MBR objective, however, can be a costly endeavor. In this thesis, we explore two different approaches for estimating the MBR objective. Lastly, we try to construct the MBR translation by backpropagating through the utility function. The …
