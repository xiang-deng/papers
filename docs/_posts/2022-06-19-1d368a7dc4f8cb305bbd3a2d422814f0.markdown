The vast volume of free code maintained on open-source code management systems significantly simplifies the process of producing and sharing open-source software. Recently, we have seen a growing trend in which these open-source software is being used for neural code learning without authorization. Note that open-source software does not necessarily imply unrestricted usage, eg, software under the BSD license requires users to retain the copyright notice and credit the software s
