Abstract Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) can capture the speakers emotional changes in multiple rounds of conversation, so it has a wide range of applications. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks have been naturally used in ERC tasks due to their ability to capture complex non-Euclidian spatial features. However, how to model conversations easily and effectively to improve the effect of ERC in the complex interaction mode still needs to be explored. To this end, we  Cites: Compare to the knowledge: Graph neural fake news detection with
