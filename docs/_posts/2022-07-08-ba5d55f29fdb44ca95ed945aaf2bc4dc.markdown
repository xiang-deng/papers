Why are some narratives more successful? Although this question has ancient roots, studying it empirically has been challenging. We suggest that semantic progression (ie, semantic similarity between adjoining portions of a narrative) might shape audience responses but that this role changes over the course of a narrative. Specifically, although slower semantic progression (ie, greater semantic similarity between adjoining portions) is beneficial at the beginning of narratives, faster  Cites: Deep unordered composition rivals syntactic methods for text
