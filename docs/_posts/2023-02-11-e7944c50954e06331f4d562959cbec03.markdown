In recent years, joint triple extraction methods have received extensive attention because they have significantly promoted the progress of information extraction and many related downstream tasks in the field of natural language processing. However, due to the inherent complexity of language such as relation overlap, joint extraction model still faces great challenges. Most of the existing models to solve the overlapping problem adopt the strategy of constructing complex semantic shared Cites: Exploiting syntactico-semantic structures for relation extraction
