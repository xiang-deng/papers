A task-oriented dialogue system (TOD) is an important application of artificial intelligence. In the past few years, works on multi-domain TODs have attracted increased research attention and have seen much progress. A main challenge of such dialogue systems is finding way to deal with cross-domain slot sharing and dialogue act temporal planning. However, existing studies seldom consider the models reasoning ability over the dialogue history; moreover, existing methods Cites: RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach
