Social media data analysis in a smart city context can represent an efficacious instrument to inform decision making. The manuscript strives to leverage the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques applied to Twitter messages using supervised learning to achieve real-time automated event detection in smart cities. A semantic-based taxonomy of risks is devised to discover and analyse associated events from data streams, with a view to:(i) read and process, in real-time …
