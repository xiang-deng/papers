The ability to generalise well is one of the primary desiderata of natural language processing NLP). Yet, whatgood generalisation entails and how it should be evaluated is not well understood, nor are there any common standards to evaluate it. In this paper, we aim to lay the ground-work to improve both of these issues. We present a taxonomy for characterising and understanding generalisation research in NLP, we use that taxonomy to present a comprehensive map of published Cites: Exploring unexplored generalization challenges for cross
