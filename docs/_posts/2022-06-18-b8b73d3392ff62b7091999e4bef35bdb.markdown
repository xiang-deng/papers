Sample-based estimation, which uses a sample to estimate population parameters (eg, SUM, COUNT, and AVG), has various applications in database systems. A sampler defines how samples are drawn from a population. Various samplers have been proposed (eg, uniform sampler, stratified sampler, and measure-biased sampler), since there is no single sampler that works well in all cases. To overcome the one size does not fit all challenge, we study how to combine multiple samplers Cites: Database learning: Toward a database that becomes smarter
