The increase in online text generation by humans and machines needs automatic text summarization systems. Recent research studies commonly use deep learning, besides sentence embedding and feature learning mechanisms, to find a solution for text summarization. But they ignore the fact that while finding the optimal solution for extractive text summarization is NP-hard, how do they ensure the quality of their solution? In our previous work, an extractive summarizer, called DSNSum, was  Cites: Ranking sentences for extractive summarization with reinforcement
