With emerging topics (eg, COVID-19) on social media as a source for the spreading misinformation, overcoming the distributional shifts between the original training domain (ie, source domain) and such target domains remains a non-trivial task for misinformation detection. This presents an elusive challenge for early-stage misinformation detection, where a good amount of data and annotations from the target domain is not available for training. To address the data scarcity issue, we Cites: Compare to the knowledge: Graph neural fake news detection with
