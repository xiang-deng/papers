Crowdsourcing learning, in which labels are collected from multiple workers through crowdsourcing platforms, has attracted much attention during the past decade. This learning paradigm would reduce the labeling cost since crowdsourcing workers may be non-expert and hence less costly. On the other hand, crowdsourcing learning algorithms also suffer from being misled by incorrect labels introduced by imperfect workers. To control such risks, recently, it has been suggested to provide workers an …
