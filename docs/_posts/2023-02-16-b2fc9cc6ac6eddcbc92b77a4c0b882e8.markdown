In this paper, we investigate the effect of addressing difficult samples from a given text dataset on the downstream text classification task. We define difficult samples as being non-obvious cases for text classification by analysing them in the semantic embedding space; specifically-(i) semantically similar samples that belong to different classes and (ii) semantically dissimilar samples that belong to the same class. We propose a penalty function to measure the overall difficulty score of every  Cites: Dataset cartography: Mapping and diagnosing datasets with
