Programmers who are new to a language find it difficult to unlearn the known language s syntax and learn the new one from scratch. To deal with this, there should be a system that translates the problem statement into a proper source code. The existing solutions for this problem are systems that works on Recurrent Neural Networks, long short-term memory architecture and other deep learning architectures whereas these technologies are inefficient as compared to the transformer Cites: A syntactic neural model for general-purpose code generation
