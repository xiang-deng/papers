Open-source code often suffers from mismatched or missing comments, leading to difficult code comprehension, and burdening software development and maintenance. In this paper, we design a novel code summarization model CodeFiD to address this laborious challenge. Inspired by retrieval-augmented methods for open-domain question answering, CodeFiD first retrieves a set of relevant comments from code collections for a given code, and then aggregates presentations of code …
