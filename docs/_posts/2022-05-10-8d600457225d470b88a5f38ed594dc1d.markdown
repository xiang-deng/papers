In today s production machine learning (ML) systems, models are continuously trained, improved, and deployed. ML design and training are becoming a continuous workflow of various tasks that have dynamic resource demands. Serverless computing is an emerging cloud paradigm that provides transparent resource management and scaling for users and has the potential to revolutionize the routine of ML design and training. However, hosting modern ML workflows on existing Cites: Well-read students learn better: On the importance of pre-training
