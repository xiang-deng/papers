Evaluating an explanation s faithfulness is desired for many reasons such as trust, interpretability and diagnosing the sources of model s errors. In this work, which focuses on the NLI task, we introduce the methodology of Faithfulness-through-Counterfactuals, which first generates a counterfactual hypothesis based on the logical predicates expressed in the explanation, and then evaluates if the model s prediction on the counterfactual is consistent with that expressed logic (ie if the new Cites: Toward Code Generation: A Survey and Lessons from Semantic
