Numerous models have tried to effectively embed knowledge graphs in low dimensions. Among the state-of-the-art methods, Graph Neural Network (GNN) models provide structure-aware representations of knowledge graphs. However, they often utilize the information of relations and their interactions with entities inefficiently. Moreover, most state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding models suffer from scalability issues because of assigning high-dimensional embeddings to …
