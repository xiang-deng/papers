How to accurately understand low-resource languages is the core of the task-oriented human-computer dialogue system. Language understanding consists of two sub-tasks, ie, intent detection and slot filling. Intent detection still faces challenges due to semantic ambiguity and implicit intentions with users input. Moreover, separately modeling intent detection and slot filling significantly decrease the correctness and relevance between questions and answers. To address these Cites: Joint semantic utterance classification and slot filling with recursive
