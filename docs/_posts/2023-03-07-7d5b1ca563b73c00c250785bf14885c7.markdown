End-to-end neural models for conversational AI often assume that a response can be generated by considering only the knowledge acquired by the model during training. Documentoriented conversational models make a similar assumption by conditioning the input on the document and assuming that any other knowledge is captured in the model s weights. However, a conversation may refer to external knowledge sources. In this work, we present EKo-DoC, an architecture for Cites: Evidentiality-guided generation for knowledge-intensive nlp tasks
