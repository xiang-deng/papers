Session-based recommendation aims to recommend the next item of an anonymous user session. Previous models consider only the current session and learn both of the user s global and local preferences. These models fail to consider an important source of information, ie, the co-occurrence pattern of items in different sessions. The co-occurrence patterns elicit the trajectory of other similar users and can improve the recommendation performance. We propose an Item Co-occurrence Graph Cites: Structure-based protein function prediction using graph
