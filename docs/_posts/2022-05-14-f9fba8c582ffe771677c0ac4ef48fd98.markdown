This paper studies the methodology of inferring bullish or bearish sentiments in the financial domain. The task aims to predict a real value to represent the sentiment intensity concerning a target (company or stock symbol) in a text. Previous researches have proved the validity of using deep neural networks to automatically learn semantic and syntactic information for sentiment prediction. Despite the promising performance, these approaches implicitly obtain the target-sentiment Cites: What does BERT look at? An analysis of BERT s attention
