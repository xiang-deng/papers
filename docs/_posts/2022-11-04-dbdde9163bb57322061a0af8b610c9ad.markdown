General-purpose code generation aims to automatically convert the natural language (NL) description to code snippets in a general-purpose programming language (GPL) like Python. Intrinsically, code generation is a special type of text generation that generates well-formed text, ie, code. However, existing sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) approaches generate the GPL code neglecting the grammar rules. To this end, in this paper, we make the first attempt to consider grammatical  Cites: Incoder: A generative model for code infilling and synthesis
