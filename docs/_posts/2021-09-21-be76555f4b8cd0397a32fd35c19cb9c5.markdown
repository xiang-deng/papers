Tables store rich numerical data, but numerical reasoning over tables is still a challenge. In this paper, we find that the spreadsheet formula, which performs calculations on numerical values in tables, is naturally a strong supervision of numerical reasoning. More importantly, large amounts of spreadsheets with expert- made formulae are available on the web and can be obtained easily. FORTAP is the first method for numerical-reasoning-aware table pretraining by leveraging large Cites: Spider: A Large-Scale Human-Labeled Dataset for Complex and
