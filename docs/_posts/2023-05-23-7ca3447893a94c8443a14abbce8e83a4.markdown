Humans have the remarkable ability to solve different tasks by simply reading textual instructions that define the tasks and looking at a few examples. Natural Language Processing (NLP) models built with the conventional machine learning paradigm, however, often struggle to generalize across tasks (eg, a question-answering system cannot solve classification tasks) despite training with lots of examples. A long-standing challenge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to build a model that learns a new …
