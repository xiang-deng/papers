Abstract Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to learn the representation of entities and predicates in low-dimensional vector spaces which can complete the missing parts of the Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Nevertheless, temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) that include time information are more consistent with real-world application scenarios. Meanwhile, the facts with time constraints make the results of reasoning over time more accurate. Because of these, we propose a novel temporal  Cites: Learning Entity and Relation Embeddings for Knowledge Graph
