Abstract Knowledge graphs (KGs) are collections of real-world knowledge that is represented by a structured form of triples. Since they are manually built in their nascent stage, there is a common problem that some links (triples) are missing. Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to find those missing links and thereby complete the KGs. However, as knowledge increases through diverse sources, new entities have explosively emerged and they are needed to be connected to existing …
