DARTS is a popular gradient-based method for Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Many extensions have been introduced in the literature, resulting in various state-of-the-art models for many datasets. As such, DARTS can now be regarded as a family of methods. Most proposed extensions focus on improving DARTS computational and memory demands and its effectiveness in generating competent architectures. Nonetheless, as with most NAS methods, DARTS is quite computationally expensive …
