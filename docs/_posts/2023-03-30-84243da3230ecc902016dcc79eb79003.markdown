The neural network has become an integral part of modern software systems. However, they still suffer from various problems, in particular, vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this work, we present a novel program reasoning framework for neural-network verification, which we refer to as symbolic reasoning. The key components of our framework are the use of the symbolic domain and the quadratic relation. The symbolic domain has very flexible semantics, and the quadratic relation  Cites: Enabling certification of verification-agnostic networks via memory
