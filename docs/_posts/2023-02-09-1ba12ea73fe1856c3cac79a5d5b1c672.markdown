In this paper, we build a model named VuLASTE, which regards vulnerability detection as a special text classification task. To solve the vocabulary explosion problem, VuLASTE uses a byte level BPE algorithm from natural language processing. In VuLASTE, a new AST path embedding is added to represent source code nesting information. We also use a combination of global and dilated window attention from Longformer to extract long sequence semantic from source code. To …
