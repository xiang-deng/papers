The rapid development of deep natural language processing (NLP) models for text classification has led to an urgent need for a unified understanding of these models proposed individually. Existing methods cannot meet the need for understanding different models in one framework due to the lack of a unified measure for explaining both low-level (eg, words) and high-level (eg, phrases) features. We have developed a visual analysis tool, DeepNLPVis, to enable a unified understanding of NLP  Cites: Interactive Attention Model Explorer for Natural Language
