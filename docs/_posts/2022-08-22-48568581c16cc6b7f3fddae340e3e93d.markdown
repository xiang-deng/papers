An exhaustive study has been conducted to investigate span-based models for the joint entity and relation extraction task. However, these models sample a large number of negative entities and negative relations during the model training, which are essential but result in grossly imbalanced data distributions and in turn cause suboptimal model performance. In order to address the above issues, we propose a two-phase paradigm for the span-based joint entity and relation extraction, which Cites: A linear programming formulation for global inference in natural
