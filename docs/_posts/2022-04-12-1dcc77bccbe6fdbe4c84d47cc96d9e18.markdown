Significant progress has been made by joint entity and relation extraction methods, which directly generate the relation triplets and mitigate the issue of overlapping relations. However, previous models generate the entity-relation triplets solely from input sentences. Such information is insufficient to support the modeling of interactive information between entities and relations. In this paper, we define the features that provide mutual supports for entity and relation detection but can only be accessed at Cites: A General Framework for Information Extraction using Dynamic
