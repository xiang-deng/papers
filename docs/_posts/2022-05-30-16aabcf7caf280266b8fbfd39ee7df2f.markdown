This paper investigates non-Horn knowledge bases with fuzzy predicates. Inference from these knowledge bases excludes reasoning by contradiction, and it is characterized by means of substructural single-succedent sequent calculi with non-logical axioms expressing knowledge base rules and facts. A variety of truth functions can be used for the bodies of knowledge base rules and their contrapositives. Lower bounds of fuzzy truth values of ground literals are obtained by Cites: Neural logic machines
