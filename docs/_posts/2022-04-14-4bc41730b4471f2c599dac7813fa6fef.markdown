Abstract Cross-domain Sentiment Classification (CDSC) aims to exploit useful knowledge from the source domain to obtain a high-performance classifier on the target domain. Most of the existing methods for CDSC mainly concentrate on extracting domain-shared features, while ignoring the importance of domain-specific features. Besides, these approaches focus on reducing the discrepancy of the source domain and target domain on the word-level. As a result, they cannot fully capture Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
