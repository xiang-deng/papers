Nowadays many research articles are prefaced with research highlights to summarize the main findings of the paper. Highlights not only help researchers precisely and quickly identify the contributions of a paper, they also enhance the discoverability of the article via search engines. We aim to automatically construct research highlights given certain segments of the research paper. We use a pointer-generator network with coverage mechanism and a contextual embedding layer at  Cites: A supervised approach to extractive summarisation of scientific
