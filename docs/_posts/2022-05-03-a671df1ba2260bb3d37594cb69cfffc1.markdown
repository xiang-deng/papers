Semantic parsing is a mainstream method of knowledge base question answering task that first generates a set of logical forms according to question and knowledge base (KB), and then selects the most matching one to get answers. However, existing selection methods are usually based on word-level matching, which cannot capture the structural information or solve the long-term dependency problem of entities. To solve this problem, we propose a syntax-based graph matching method, which Cites: The value of semantic parse labeling for knowledge base question
