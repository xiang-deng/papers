Unsupervised sentence embeddings learning has been recently dominated by contrastive learning methods (eg, SimCSE), which keep positive pairs similar and push negative pairs apart. The contrast operation aims to keep as much information as possible by maximizing the mutual information between positive instances, which leads to redundant information in sentence embedding. To address this problem, we present an information minimization based contrastive learning (InforMin-CL) model …
