Predicting function names in stripped binaries is an extremely useful but challenging task, as it requires summarizing the execution behavior and semantics of the function in human languages. Recently, there has been significant progress in this direction with machine learning. However, existing approaches fail to model the exhaustive function behavior and thus suffer from the poor generalizability to unseen binaries. To advance the state of the art, we present a function Symbol name prediction and Cites: Augmenting Decompiler Output with Learned Variable Names and
