In this paper we demonstrate the potentiality of the Frame-based Ontology Design Outlet (FrODO), a tool that relies on FRED for generating RDF from the natural language. FrODO exploits frame semantics for tailoring sound OWL ontologies addressing the given CQs. We envision that FrODO can be used to make agile ontology design methodologies (eg XD, SAMOD, etc.) smoother. Cites: Machine Reading.
