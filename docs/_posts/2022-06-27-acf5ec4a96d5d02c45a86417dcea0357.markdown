In this paper we compare various text generation models  ability to write poetry in the style of early English Romanticism. These models include: Character-Level Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory, Hugging Face s GPT-2, OpenAI s GPT-3, and EleutherAI s GPT-NEO. Quality was measured based syllable count and coherence with the automatic evaluation metric GRUEN. Character-Level Recurrent Neural Networks performed far worse compared to transformer models …
