Event extraction (EE) is a crucial research task for promptly apprehending event information from massive textual data. With the rapid development of deep learning, EE based on deep learning technology has become a research hotspot. Numerous methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics have been proposed in the literature, raising the need for a comprehensive and updated survey. This article fills the research gap by reviewing the state-of-the-art approaches, especially focusing on Cites: Ester: A machine reading comprehension dataset for reasoning
