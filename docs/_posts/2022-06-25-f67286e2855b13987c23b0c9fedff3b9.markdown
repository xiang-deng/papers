WiFi 5/6 relies on a key feature, Multi-User Multiple-In-Multiple-Out (MU-MIMO), to offer high-volume network throughput and spectrum efficiency. MU-MIMO uses a user selection algorithm, based on each user s channel state information (CSI), to schedule transmission opportunities for a group of users to maximize the service quality and efficiency. In this paper, we discover that such algorithm creates a subtle attack surface for attackers to subvert user selection in MU-MIMO, causing severe …
