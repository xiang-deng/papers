When used to process source code, graph neural networks have been shown to produce impressive results for a wide range of software engineering tasks. Existing techniques, however, still have two issues:(1) long-term dependency and (2) different code components are treated as equals when they should not be. To address these issues, we propose a method for representing code as a hierarchy (Code Hierarchy), in which different code components are represented separately at various levels of Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
