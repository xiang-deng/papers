Reliable and timely rice distribution information is of great value for real-time, quantitative, and localized control of rice production information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has all-weather and all-day observation capability to monitor rice distribution in tropical and subtropical areas. To improve the physical interpretability and spatial interpretability of the deep learning model for SAR rice field extraction, a new SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) value-guided explanation model (SGEM)  Cites: Explain yourself! leveraging language models for commonsense
