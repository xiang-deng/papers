With an aging population and a growing shortage of caregivers, the need for in-home robots is increasing. However, it is intractable for robots to have all functionalities pre-programmed prior to deployment. Instead, it is more realistic for robots to engage in supplemental, on-site learning about the user s needs and preferences. Such learning may occur in the presence of or involve the user. We investigate the impacts on end-users of in situ robot learning through a series of human-subjects Cites: Legibility and predictability of robot motion
