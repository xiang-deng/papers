Despite the broad application of deep reinforcement learning (RL), transferring and adapting the policy to unseen but similar environments is still a significant challenge. Recently, the language-conditioned policy is proposed to facilitate policy transfer through learning the joint representation of observation and text that catches the compact and invariant information across environments. Existing studies of language-conditioned RL methods often learn the joint representation as a simple latent layer …
