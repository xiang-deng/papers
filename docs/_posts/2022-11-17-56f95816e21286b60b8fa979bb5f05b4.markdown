Massive datasets and high-capacity models have driven many recent advancements in computer vision and natural language understanding. This work presents a platform to enable similar success stories in Embodied AI. We propose PROCTHOR, a framework for procedural generation of Embodied AI environments. PROCTHOR enables us to sample arbitrarily large datasets of diverse, interactive, customizable, and performant virtual environments to train and evaluate embodied agents across  Cites: Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder
