Given a prefix (context), open-ended generation aims to decode texts that are coherent, which don t abruptly drift from previous topics, and informative, which don t suffer from undesired repetitions. In this paper, we propose Look-back, an improved decoding algorithm that leverages the Kullback-Leibler divergence to track the distribution distance between current and historical decoding steps. Thus Look-back can automatically predict potential repetitive phrase and topic drift, and remove Cites: Truncation Sampling as Language Model Desmoothing
