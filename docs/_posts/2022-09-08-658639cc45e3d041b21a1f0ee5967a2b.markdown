In recent years, graph convolution networks and hypergraph convolution networks have become a research hotspot in collaborative filtering (CF) because of their information extraction ability in dealing with the user-item interaction information. In particular, hypergraph can model high-order correlation of users and items to achieve better performance. However, the existing graph-based CF methods for mining interactive information remain incomplete and limit the expressiveness of the Cites: Adaptive Graph Encoder for Attributed Graph Embedding
