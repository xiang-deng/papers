The normalized abstract Laplacian tensor of a weighted hypergraph is investigated. The connectivity of the hypergraph is associated with the geometric multiplicity of the smallest eigenvalue of the abstract Laplacian tensor. There is an inequality between the normalized cut of the hypergraph and the second smallest eigenvalue of the abstract Laplacian tensor. An optimization method of the hypergraph clustering is established and analyzed. Numerical examples illustrate that our method is effective.
