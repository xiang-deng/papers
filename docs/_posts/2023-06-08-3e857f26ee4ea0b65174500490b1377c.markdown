Large scale machine learning lies at the core of many artificial intelligence s recent successes exemplified by AlphaGo, BERT, DALL-E, GitHub Copilot, AlphaCode, and ChatGPT. These large scale models are undoubtedly powerful but very expensive to train. To make them less expensive, we incorporate sequential decision making into machine learning model training. Sequential decision making has long been the focus of stand-alone fields (eg, reinforcement learning and multi-armed bandit). We …
