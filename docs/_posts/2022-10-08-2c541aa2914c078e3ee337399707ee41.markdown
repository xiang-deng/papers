The number of newly published vulnerabilities is constantly increasing. Until now, the information available when a new vulnerability is published is manually assessed by experts using a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) vector and score. This assessment is time consuming and requires expertise. Various works already try to predict CVSS vectors or scores using machine learning based on the textual descriptions of the vulnerability to enable faster assessment. However, for this …
