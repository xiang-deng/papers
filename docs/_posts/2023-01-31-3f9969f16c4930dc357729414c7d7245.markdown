Relation extraction is a fundamental task to construct a knowledge graph, which aims to find the relation categories between two entities from a string of text input sequences. Considering the fact that high-quality labeled data is rare, a recent trend is low-resource setting. Existing works either utilize prompt-based learning method to achieve encouraging results for few-shot tasks by determining an appropriate prompt template, or leverage unlabeled data by generating pseudo labels. However, the …
