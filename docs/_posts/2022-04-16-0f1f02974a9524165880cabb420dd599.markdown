Protein representation learning methods have shown great potential to yield useful representation for many downstream tasks, especially on protein classification. Moreover, a few recent studies have shown great promise in addressing insufficient labels of proteins with self-supervised learning methods. However, existing protein language models are usually pretrained on protein sequences without considering the important protein structural information. To this end, we propose a novel structure Cites: Fine-tuning pretrained language models: Weight initializations
