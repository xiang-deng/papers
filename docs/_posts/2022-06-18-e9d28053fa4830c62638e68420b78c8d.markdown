This study presents JRIRD s work on the FinNum-3 Manager s Claim Detection subtask. Numeracy is essential in financial documents and some studies have focused on numerical information representations in natural language processing. For the FinNum-3 task, we tried four representations of numerical value in a text and experimented with joint learning using numerical category information. The results showed that the best format of numerical values depended on a pre-trained model
