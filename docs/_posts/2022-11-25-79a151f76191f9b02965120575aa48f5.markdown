Detecting opportunities and threats from massive text data is a challenging task for most. Traditionally, companies would rely mainly on structured data to detect and predict risks, losing a huge amount of information that could be extracted from unstructured text data. Fortunately, artificial intelligence came to remedy this issue by innovating in data extraction and processing techniques, allowing us to understand and make use of Natural Language data and turning it into structures that a machine Cites: Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research
