Knowledge graph (KG) can provide users with semantic information and relations among numerous entities and nodes, which can greatly facilitate the performance of recommender systems. However, existing KG-based approaches still suffer from severe data sparsity, and may not be effective in capturing the preference features of similar entities across domains. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a P reference-aware G raph A ttention network model with C ollaborative K nowledge G raph for …
