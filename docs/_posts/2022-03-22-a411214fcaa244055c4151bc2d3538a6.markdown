We propose a methodology to populate the verb type hierarchy of a deep computational grammar in the HPSG formalism using syntactic and morphological information from Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks. It is exemplified by means of the UD Bosque corpus and PorGram, a computational grammar for Portuguese constructed in the LinGO Grammar Matrix framework, but it can be applied to analogous grammars of other languages using other UD treebanks.
