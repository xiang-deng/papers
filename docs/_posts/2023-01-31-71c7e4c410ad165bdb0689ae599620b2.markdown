COILcr: Efficient Semantic Matching in Contextualized Exact Match Retrieval Page 1 COILcr: Efficient Semantic Matching in Contextualized Exact Match Retrieval Zhen Fan, Luyu Gao, Rohan Jha, and Jamie Callan Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh PA 15213, USA Abstract. Lexical exact match systems that use inverted lists are a fundamental text retrieval architecture. A recent advance in neural IR, COIL, extends this approach with contextualized inverted lists from a deep language model backbone and  Cites: Efficient passage retrieval with hashing for open-domain question
