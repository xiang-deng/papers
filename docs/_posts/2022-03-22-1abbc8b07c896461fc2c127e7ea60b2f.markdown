We consider how a user (called requester) in an OSN selects a small number of users and invites them as new friends/followers so as to maximize his social visibility. More importantly, the requester has to do this under the anonymity setting, which means he is not allowed to know the neighborhood information of other users in the OSN. We first develop a mathematical model to quantify the social visibility and formulate the problem of visibility maximization with anonymity guarantee Cites: Recommender systems with social regularization
