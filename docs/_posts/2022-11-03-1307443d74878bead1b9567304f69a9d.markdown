Program code as a data source is gaining popularity in the data science community. Possible applications for models trained on such assets range from classification for data dimensionality reduction to automatic code generation. However, without annotation number of methods that could be applied is somewhat limited. To address the lack of annotated datasets, we present the Code4ML corpus. It contains code snippets, task summaries, competitions and dataset descriptions publicly available …
