This paper proposes an approach to querying a relational database D and a graph G taken together in SQL. We introduce a semantic extension of joins across D and G such that if a tuple t in D and a vertex v in G refer to the same real-world entity, then we join t and v to correlate their information and complement tuple t with additional properties of vertex v from the graph. Moreover, we extract hidden relationships between t and other entities by exploring paths from v. To support the semantic joins Cites: Navigating Extracted Data with Schema Discovery.
