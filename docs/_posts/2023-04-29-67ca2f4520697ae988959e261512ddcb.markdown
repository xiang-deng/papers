Currently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) do not cope well with the distribution shift problem, resulting in models trained on the training set failing in real test scenarios. To address this problem, the test-time adaptation (TTA) shows great potential, which updates model parameters to suit the test data at the testing time. Existing TTA methods rely on well-designed auxiliary tasks or self-training strategies based on pseudo-label. However, these methods do not achieve good trade-offs …
