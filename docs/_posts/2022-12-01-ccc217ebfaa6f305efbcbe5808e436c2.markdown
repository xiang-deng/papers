Minimal changes to neural architectures (eg changing a single hyperparameter in a key layer), can lead to significant gains in predictive performance in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In this work, we present a new approach to receptive field analysis that can yield these types of theoretical and empirical performance gains across twenty well-known CNN architectures examined in our experiments. By further developing and formalizing the analysis of receptive field expansion in …
