Fingerphoto images captured using a smartphone are successfully used to verify the individuals that have enabled several applications. This work presents a novel algorithm for fingerphoto verification using a nested residual block: Finger-NestNet. The proposed Finger-NestNet architecture is designed with three consecutive convolution blocks followed by a series of nested residual blocks to achieve reliable fingerphoto verification.
