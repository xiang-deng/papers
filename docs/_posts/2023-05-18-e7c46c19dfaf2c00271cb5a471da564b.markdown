Python, as one of the most popular and important programming languages in the era of data science, has recently introduced a syntax for static type annotations with PEP 484, to improve code maintainability, quality, and readability. However, it is still unknown whether and how static type annotations are used in practical Python projects. This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first and most comprehensive empirical study on the defects, evolution and rectification of static …
