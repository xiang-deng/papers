Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning approach that integrates supervised and unsupervised learning mechanisms. This integration may be done in different ways and one possibility is to use a wrapper-based strategy. The main aim of a wrapper-based strategy is to use a small number of labelled instances to create a learning model. Then, this created model is used in a labelling process, where some unlabelled instances are labelled, and consequently, these instances are Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
