Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained great popularity in tackling various analytical tasks on graph-structured data (ie, networks). Typical GNNs and their variants follow a message-passing manner that obtains network representations by the feature propagation process along network topology, which however ignore the rich textual semantics (eg, local word-sequence) that exist in many real-world networks. Existing methods for text-rich networks integrate textual semantics by  Cites: Compare to the knowledge: Graph neural fake news detection with
