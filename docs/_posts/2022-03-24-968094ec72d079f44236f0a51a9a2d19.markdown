With the continuous development on computer science and technology, people have begun to use automatic reasoning systems to solve some logical mathematical proof problems. The traditional reasoning system can use the finite conditions to verify the conclusion of the problem, to achieve the effect of proving geometric problems. However, there is no unified standard for the proof of plane geometric problems, it is impossible to use formulas to prove directly. More importantly, some problems do not Cites: Diagram understanding in geometry questions
