Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) compression is crucial to deploying these models in edge devices with limited resources. Existing channel pruning algorithms for CNNs have achieved plenty of success on complex models. They approach the pruning problem from various perspectives and use different metrics to guide the pruning process. However, these metrics mainly focus on the model soutputs orweights and neglect itsinterpretations information. To fill in this gap, we propose to  Cites: Good subnetworks provably exist: Pruning via greedy forward
