Distance oracles answer shortest-path queries between any pair of nodes in a graph. They are often built using succinct graph representations such as spanners, sketches, and compressors to minimize oracle size and query answering latency. Node embeddings, in particular, o er graph representations that place adjacent nodes nearby each other in a low-rank space. However, their use in the design of distance oracles has not been su ciently studied. In this paper, we empirically Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
