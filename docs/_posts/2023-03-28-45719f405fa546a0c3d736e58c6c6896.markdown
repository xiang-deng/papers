In recent years, AI studies have been focused on developing question answering systems to deal with automatic answering natural language questions. Knowledge based open domain question answering systems can generate accurate answers to questions posed by users in various fields. However, these systems need further development to scale the domain of answer retrieval systems and question interpretation. Deep learning methods are one of the current approaches in this Cites: Semantic parsing for single-relation question answering
