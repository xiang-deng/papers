Abstract Information extraction (IE), which aims to retrieve meaningful information from plain text, has been widely studied in general and professional domains to support downstream applications. However, due to the lack of labeled data and the complexity of professional mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) information, it is challenging to apply current common deep learning IE methods to the MEP domain. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a rule-based approach for MEP Cites: Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text
