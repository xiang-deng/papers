The recent development of large Neural Language Models (NLMs) based on end-toend deep learning architectures has delivered unprecedented breakthroughs in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Most remarkably, this progress has been driven by a simple pipeline that consists of initially training a NLM, without supervision, on large corpora (ie, pre-training), followed by fine-tuning that same NLM for different tasks using relatively small task-specific datasets. Consequently …
