With the increasing release of powerful language models trained on large code corpus (eg CodeBERT was trained on 6.4 million programs), a new family of mutation testing tools has arisen with the promise to generate more natural mutants in the sense that the mutated code aims at following the implicit rules and coding conventions typically produced by programmers. In this paper, we study to what extent the mutants produced by language models can semantically mimic the Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
