Natural language processing (NLP) is having a paradigm shift. Scaling up in terms of the sizes of models and data plays an increasingly important role. Despite the remarkable empirical gain in various well-bounded NLP tasks, the ability to generalize to complex unseen scenarios is still elusive. Further, the growing computational requirements have heightened the barriers to entry to NLP research. The inquiry of this thesis can be broadly divided into two research questions: What …
