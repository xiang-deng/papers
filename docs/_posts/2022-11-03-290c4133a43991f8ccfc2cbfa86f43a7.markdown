Understanding the rationale behind the predictions produced by machine learning models is a necessary prerequisite for human to build confidence and trust for the intelligent systems. To tackle the problem of interpretability faced by black-box models, a fuzzy local surrogate model is proposed in this study to articulate the rationale for predictions to enhance the interpretability of the results of machine learning models. Fuzzy rule-based model comes with high interpretability since it is  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
