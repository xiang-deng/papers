Real-world databases are often inconsistent. Although there has been an extensive body of work on handling inconsistency, little work has been done on measuring inconsistency in databases. In this paper, building on work done on measuring inconsistency in propositional knowledge bases, we explore inconsistency measures (IMs) for definite and indefinite databases with denial constraints. We first introduce database IMs that are inspired by well-established methods to quantify inconsistency …
