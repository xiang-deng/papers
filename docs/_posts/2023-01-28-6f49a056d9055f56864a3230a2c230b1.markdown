Fluent human-human teaming is often characterized by tacit interaction without explicit communication. This is because explicit communication, such as language utterances and gestures, are inherently interruptive. On the other hand, tacit interaction requires team situation awareness (TSA) to facilitate, which often relies on explicit communication to maintain, creating a paradox. In this paper, we consider implicit and naturalistic team status projection for tacit human-robot interaction Cites: Legibility and predictability of robot motion. In 2013 8th ACM
