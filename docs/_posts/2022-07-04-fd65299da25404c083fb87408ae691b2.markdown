Answering queries accurately at interactive speeds has become more challenging in modern data systems due to the massive growth of data. Such challenges lead to an increasing interest in Approximate Query Processing (AQP) techniques because they enable timely query execution in scenarios that can tolerate some degree of inaccuracy. While latency and accuracy have been the two main factors considered by many AQP systems, in our studies, we found other dimensions like applicability Cites: Database learning: Toward a database that becomes smarter
