However, most state-of-the-art AI algorithms are black-box models, which means that humans cannot understand how such models make decisions. To forestall an algorithm-based authoritarian society, decisions based on machine learning ought to inspire trust by being explainable. For AI explainability to be practical, it must be feasible to obtain explanations systematically and automatically. A usual Cites: Programs as black-box explanations
