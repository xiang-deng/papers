Large language models have demonstrated the ability to condition on and generate both natural language and programming language text. Such models open up the possibility of multi-language code generation: could code generation models generalize knowledge from one language to another? Although contemporary code generation models can generate semantically correct Python code, little is known about their abilities with other languages. We facilitate the exploration of this topic by Cites: Incoder: A generative model for code infilling and synthesis
