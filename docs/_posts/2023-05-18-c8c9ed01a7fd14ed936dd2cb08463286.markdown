Recently, software defect prediction studies have attempted to make black-box defect prediction models explainable and actionable. State-of-the-art defect prediction studies have utilized various model-agnostic techniques derived from the explainable AI domain as key tools to make the predictions easier for practitioners to understand. However, it has not been sufficiently investigated whether there is inconsistent information within local explanations generated by different model Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
