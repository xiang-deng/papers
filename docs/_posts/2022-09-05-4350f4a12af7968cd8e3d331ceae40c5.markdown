Automated source code generation is currently a popular machinelearning-based task. It can be helpful for software developers to write functionally correct code from a given context. However, just like human developers, a code generation model can produce vulnerable code, which the developers can mistakenly use. For this reason, evaluating the security of a code generation model is a must. In this paper, we describe SecurityEval, an evaluation dataset to fulfill this purpose. It contains 130  Cites: Incoder: A generative model for code infilling and synthesis
