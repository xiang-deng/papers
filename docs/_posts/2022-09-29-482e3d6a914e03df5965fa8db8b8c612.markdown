In recent years, the mainstream Temporal Relation (TempRel) classification methods may not take advantage of the large amount of semantic information contained in golden TempRel labels, which is lost by the traditional discrete one-hot labels. To solve this problem, we propose a new approach that can make full use of golden TempRel label information and make the model perform better. Firstly we build a TempRel Classification (TC) model, which consists of a RoBERTa and a Classifier Cites: Joint constrained learning for event-event relation extraction
