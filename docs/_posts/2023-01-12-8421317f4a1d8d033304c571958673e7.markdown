Mutation testing is an established fault-based testing technique. It operates by seeding faults into the programs under test and asking developers to write tests that reveal these faults. These tests have the potential to reveal a large number of faults--those that couple with the seeded ones--and thus are deemed important. To this end, mutation testing should seed faults that are both natural in a sense easily understood by developers and strong (have high chances to reveal faults).
