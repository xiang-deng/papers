Many current intrinsically interpretable machine learning models can only handle the data that are linear, low-dimensional, and relatively independent attributes and often with discrete attribute values, while the models that are capable of handling high-dimensional nonlinear data, like deep learning, have very poor interpretability. Based on the geometric characteristics, a new idea of accurately wrapping the data region with minimum-volume geometry is proposed for pattern classification.
