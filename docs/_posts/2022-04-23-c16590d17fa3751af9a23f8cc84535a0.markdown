Recent advances in 3D semantic segmentation with deep neural networks have shown remarkable success, with rapid performance increase on available datasets. However, current 3D semantic segmentation benchmarks contain only a small number of categories--less than 30 for ScanNet and SemanticKITTI, for instance, which are not enough to reflect the diversity of real environments (eg, semantic image understanding covers hundreds to thousands of classes). Thus, we propose to Cites: Well-read students learn better: On the importance of pre-training
