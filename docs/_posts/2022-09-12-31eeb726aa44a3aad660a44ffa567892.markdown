Dialogue state tracking is an important module of task-oriented dialogue system. Previous studies exploited the historical dialogue information by attention-based graph structure simulation, but these methods cannot explicitly take advantage of the structure of the dialogue state. In addition, how to generate complex format dialogue states also brings challenges to research. In this paper, we propose a state memory graph network (SMGN). The network saves historical information through the state  Cites: Find or classify? dual strategy for slot-value predictions on multi
