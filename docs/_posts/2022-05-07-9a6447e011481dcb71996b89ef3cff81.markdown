Implicit event argument extraction (EAE) aims to identify arguments that could scatter over the document. Most previous work focuses on learning the direct relations between arguments and the given trigger, while the implicit relations with long-range dependency are not well studied. Moreover, recent neural network based approaches rely on a large amount of labeled data for training, which is unavailable due to the high labelling cost. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum learning based Cites: Higher-order Coreference Resolution with Coarse-to-fine Inference
