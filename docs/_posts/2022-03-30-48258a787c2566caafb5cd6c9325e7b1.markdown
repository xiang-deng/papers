In this paper, we study the zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) task, which retrieves natural images related to sketch queries from unseen categories. In the literature, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the defacto standard and they are either trained end-to-end or used to extract pre-trained features for images and sketches. However, CNNs are limited in modeling the global structural information of objects due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations Cites: Spherical Latent Spaces for Stable Variational Autoencoders
