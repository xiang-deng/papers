Deep learning techniques have recently been applied to analyze associations between gene expression data and disease phenotypes. However, there are concerns regarding the black box problem: it is difficult to interpret why the prediction results are obtained using deep learning models from model parameters. New methods have been proposed for interpreting deep learning model predictions but have not been applied to genetics. In this study, we demonstrated that applying …
