Relation extraction is a fundamental topic in document information extraction. Traditionally, datasets for relation extraction have been annotated with named entities and classified with a subset of relation categories.

However, current approaches are limited by datasets with a narrow definition of entities and relations. We seek to remedy this by introducing our Cites: A Frustratingly Easy Approach for Entity and Relation Extraction
