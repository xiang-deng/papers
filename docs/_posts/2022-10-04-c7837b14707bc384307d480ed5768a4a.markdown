Few-shot learning with N-way K-shot scheme is an open challenge in machine learning. Many approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem, eg, the Matching Networks and CLIP-Adapter. Despite that these approaches have shown significant progress, the mechanism of why these methods succeed has not been well explored. In this paper, we interpret these few-shot learning methods via causal mechanism. We show that the existing approaches can be viewed as specific forms Cites: VL-Adapter: Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for Vision-and
