Graph representation learning has attracted tremendous attention due to its remarkable performance in many real-world applications. However, prevailing (semi- ) supervised graph representation learning models for specific tasks often suffer from label sparsity issue as data labeling is always time and resource consuming. In light of this, few-shot learning on graphs (FSLG), which combines the strengths of graph representation learning and few-shot learning together, has been proposed to tackle Cites: Convolutional 2d knowledge graph embeddings
