Knowledge graph completion (KGC) is one of the effective methods to identify new facts in knowledge graph. Except for a few methods based on graph network, most of KGC methods trend to be trained based on independent triples, while are difficult to take a full account of the information of global network connection contained in knowledge network. To address these issues, in this study, we propose a simple and effective Network-based Pre-training framework for knowledge graph completion Cites: Multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning with reward shaping
