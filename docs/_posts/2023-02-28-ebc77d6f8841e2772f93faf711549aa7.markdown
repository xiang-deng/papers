Entity Linking is the task of mapping entity mentions in text to real entity in a given knowledge base. One of the main obstacles to this task is the variations of name and the ambiguity of the entity. Prior studies have explored various methods for modeling local semantic relatedness between each entity-mention pair and global topical mention consistency to address these issues. Nevertheless, most of these existing methods are relatively complex so that they are impractical in some situation, eg on Cites: Capturing Semantic Similarity for Entity Linking with Convolutional
