The self-attention mechanism can break the limitation of the receptive field, model in a global scope, and extract global information efficiently. In this work, we propose a lightweight remote sensing building change detection model (ESACD). In the Encoder, we use the enhanced self-attention layer CoT Layer instead of the normal convolution operation. The CoT Layer fuses the dynamic context with the static context. Compared with the ordinary convolutional layer, this strategy can fully mine Cites: Delight: Deep and light-weight transformer
