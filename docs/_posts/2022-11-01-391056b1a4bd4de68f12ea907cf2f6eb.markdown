Parameter-efficient fine-tuning aims to achieve performance comparable to fine-tuning, using fewer trainable parameters. Several strategies (eg, Adapters, Prefix Tuning, BitFit, and LoRA) have been proposed. However, their designs are hand-crafted separately, and it remains unclear whether certain design patterns exist for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Thus, we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning design paradigm and discover design patterns that are applicable to different …
