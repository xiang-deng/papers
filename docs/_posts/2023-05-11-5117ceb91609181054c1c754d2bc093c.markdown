Open Information Extraction (OIE) aims to extract factual relational tuples from open-domain sentences. Downstream tasks use the extracted OIE tuples as facts, without examining the certainty of these facts. However, uncertainty/speculation is a common linguistic phenomenon. Existing studies on speculation detection are defined at sentence level, but even if a sentence is determined to be speculative, not all tuples extracted from it may be speculative. In this paper, we propose to study speculations …
