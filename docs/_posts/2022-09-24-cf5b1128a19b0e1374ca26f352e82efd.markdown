We develop NL2INTERFACE to explore the potential of generating usable interactive multi-visualization interfaces from natural language queries. With NL2INTERFACE, users can directly write natural language queries to automatically generate a fully interactive multi-visualization interface without any extra effort of learning a tool or programming language. Further, users can interact with the interfaces to easily transform the data and quickly see the results in the visualizations. Cites: Rat-sql: Relation-aware schema encoding and linking for text-to
