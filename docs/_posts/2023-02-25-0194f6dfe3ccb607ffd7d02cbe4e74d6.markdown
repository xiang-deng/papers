Recent progress in Deep Learning (DL) has sparked interest in using DL to detect software vulnerabilities automatically and it has been demonstrated promising results at detecting vulnerabilities. However, one prominent and practical issue for vulnerability detection is data imbalance. Prior study observed that the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL-based vulnerability detection (DLVD) approaches drops precipitously in real world imbalanced data and a 73% drop of F1-score on average Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
