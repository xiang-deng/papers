There exists spectral gap between visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) images causing dissimilar intensity according to reflection property of objects and materials. Therefore, it has a limit of applying traditional stereo matching to cross spectral disparity estimation. In this paper, we propose cross spectral disparity estimation from VIS and NIR paired images using disentangled representation and reversible neural networks. We build a supervised learning framework based on reversible  Cites: Espnet: Efficient spatial pyramid of dilated convolutions for
