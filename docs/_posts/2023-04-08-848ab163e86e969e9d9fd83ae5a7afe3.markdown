The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI s ChatGPT, could revolutionized various industries, including geotechnical engineering. However, GPT models can sometimes generate plausible-sounding but false outputs, leading to hallucinations. In this article, we discuss the importance of prompt engineering in mitigating these risks and harnessing the full potential of GPT for geotechnical applications. We explore the challenges and pitfalls associated with …
