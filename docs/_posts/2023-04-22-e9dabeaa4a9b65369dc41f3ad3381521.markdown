There are heavy demands for large and continuous supplies of new items in language testing. Automated item generation (AIG), in which computerized algorithms are used to create test items, can potentially increase the efficiency of new item development to serve this demand. A challenge for multiple-choice items is to write effective distractors, that is, incorrect yet attractive (Haladyna, 2004). We propose a prompt-based learning approach (Liu et al., 2021) for automatically Cites: Making Pre-trained Language Models Better Few-shot Learners
