Geological reports aid in understanding exploration by providing valuable information on rock formation and evolution and of the geological environment in which deposits are formed. Querying and extracting the critical information from these enormous historical geological report data helps in understanding the exploration risks in different geological settings. However, large amounts of unstructured text data occur in geological reports; therefore, it is challenging to obtain Cites: Joint inference of entities, relations, and coreference
