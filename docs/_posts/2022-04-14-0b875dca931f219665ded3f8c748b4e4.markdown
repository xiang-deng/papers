Organic and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made significant strides in the last couple of years achieving high power conversion efficiencies (18% and 29%, respectively) and exceptional stability. Ultra-flexible and environmentally stable organic and PSCs can effectively operate under various illumination settings. Herein, novel device concepts that comprise photovoltaic cells alone or in tandem with batteries or supercapacitors, acting as the main power supply to another Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
