Occasional large time delay is one of the bottlenecks for 5G applied to the industrial field. Accurate measurement, analysis, and prediction of communication network latency are of great significance. Due to the strong randomness and small number of samples in ultra-relaible and low latency communication (URLLC), the prediction task of occasional large time delay is very challenging. This paper proposes an URLLC occasional large time delay prediction method based on unbalanced …
