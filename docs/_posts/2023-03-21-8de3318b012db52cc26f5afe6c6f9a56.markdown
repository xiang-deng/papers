This tutorial will provide an overview of recent advances on neuro-symbolic approaches for information retrieval. A decade ago, knowledge graphs and semantic annotations technology led to active research on how to best leverage symbolic knowledge. At the same time, neural methods have demonstrated to be versatile and highly effective. From a neural network perspective, the same representation approach can service document ranking or knowledge graph reasoning. End-to-end …
