The field of Math-NLP has witnessed significant growth in recent years, motivated by the desire to expand LLM performance to the learning of non-linguistic notions (numerals, and subsequently, arithmetic reasoning). However, non-linguistic skill injection typically comes at a cost for LLMs: it leads to catastrophic forgetting of core linguistic skills, a consequence that often remains unaddressed in the literature. As Math-NLP has been able to create LLMs that can closely approximate the Cites: Do language embeddings capture scales?
