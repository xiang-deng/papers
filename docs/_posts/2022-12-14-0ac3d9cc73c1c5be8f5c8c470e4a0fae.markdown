Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies revolutionize vast fields of society. Humans using these systems are likely to expect them to work in a potentially hyperrational manner. However, in this study, we show that some AI systems, namely large language models (LLMs), exhibit behavior that strikingly resembles human-like intuition-and the many cognitive errors that come with them. We use a state-of-the-art LLM, namely the latest iteration of OpenAI s Generative Pre-trained Transformer Cites: Chain of thought prompting elicits reasoning in large language
