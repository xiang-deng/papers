Learning to infer labels in an open world, ie, in an environment where the target``labels are unknown, is an important characteristic for achieving autonomy. Foundation models pre-trained on enormous amounts of data have shown remarkable generalization skills through prompting, particularly in zero-shot inference. However, their performance is restricted to the correctness of the target label s search space. In an open world where these labels are unknown, the search  Cites: Sparks of artificial general intelligence: Early experiments with gpt-4
