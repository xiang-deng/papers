Abstract Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic topic model that has been used as a tool to detect the latent thematic structure in a body of text. In the context of classroom testing, LDA has been used to detect the latent themes in examinees responses to constructed-response (CR) items. There is a growing body of evidence that latent themes detected by LDA have been found to reflect the kinds of reasoning examinees use in their responses to CR items.
