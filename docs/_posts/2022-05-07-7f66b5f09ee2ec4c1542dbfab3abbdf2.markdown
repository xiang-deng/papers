Understanding human language often necessitates understanding entities and their place in a taxonomy of knowledge--their types. Previous methods to learn entity types rely on training classifiers on datasets with coarse, noisy, and incomplete labels. We introduce a method to instill fine-grained type knowledge in language models with text-to-text pre-training on type-centric questions leveraging knowledge base documents and knowledge graphs. We create the WikiWiki dataset: entities and Cites: REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training
