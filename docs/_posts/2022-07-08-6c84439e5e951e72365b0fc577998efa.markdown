The intelligent dialogue system, aiming at communicating with humans harmoniously with natural language, is brilliant for promoting the advancement of human-machine interaction in the era of artificial intelligence. With the gradually complex human-computer interaction requirements (eg, multimodal inputs, time sensitivity), it is difficult for traditional text-based dialogue system to meet the demands for more vivid and convenient interaction. Consequently, Visual Context Augmented Dialogue …
