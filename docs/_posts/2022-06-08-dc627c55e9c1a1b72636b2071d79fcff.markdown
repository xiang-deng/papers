Most publicly available datasets for image classification are with single labels, while images are inherently multi-labeled in our daily life. Such an annotation gap makes many pre-trained single-label classification models fail in practical scenarios. For aerial images, this annotation issue is more concerned: Aerial data naturally cover a relatively large land area with multiple labels, while annotated aerial datasets currently publicly available (eg, UCM, AID) are single-labeled. As manually …
