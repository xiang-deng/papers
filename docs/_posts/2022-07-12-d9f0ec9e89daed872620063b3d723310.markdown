The main focus of our work is the problem of multiple objectives optimization (MOO) while providing a final list of recommendations to the user. Currently, system designers can tune MOO by setting importance of individual objectives, usually in some kind of weighted average setting. However, this does not have to translate into the presence of such objectives in the final results. In contrast, in our work we would like to allow system designers or end-users to directly quantify the required relative …
