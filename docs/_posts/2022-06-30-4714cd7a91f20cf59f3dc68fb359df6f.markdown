During the history of artificial Neural Networks as a methodology in the research of Artificial Intelligence (AI), a continuous path of achievements has been interrupted at least two times due to the frustration of the expectations, leading to the AI winters. During these periods, funds and research efforts were directed elsewhere, towards topics and fields felt as more stable and promising. In the last two decades, the rising of Deep Learning (DL), an approach based on neural networks, paved the way to a  Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
