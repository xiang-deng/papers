We introduce CS1QA, a dataset for code-based question answering in the programming education domain. CS1QA consists of 9,237 question-answer pairs gathered from chat logs in an introductory programming class using Python, and 17,698 unannotated chat data with code. Each question is accompanied with the student s code, and the portion of the code relevant to answering the question. We carefully design the annotation process to construct CS1QA, and analyze the Cites: Graph-based, self-supervised program repair from diagnostic
