During software evolution, developers make several changes and commit them into the repositories. Unfortunately, many of them tangle different purposes, both hampering program comprehension and reducing separation of concerns. Automated approaches with deterministic solutions have been proposed to untangle commits. However, specifying an effective clustering criteria on the changes in a commit for untangling is challenging for those approaches. In this work, we present Cites: Removing the training wheels: A coreference dataset that
