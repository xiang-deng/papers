Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT) enables smart objects to connect and share information, thus unlocking the potential for end users to receive more and better information and services. In the Social IoT (SIoT), objects adopt a social behavior, where they establish social connections to other objects and can operate autonomously in order to accomplish a given task. In this work, we present an SIoT architecture, called DANOS, based on three principles, dynamicity, decentralization Cites: Recommender systems with social regularization
