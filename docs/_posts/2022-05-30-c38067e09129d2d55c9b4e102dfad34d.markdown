Dense retrieval uses a contrastive learning framework to learn dense representations of queries and contexts. Trained encoders are directly used for each test query, but they often fail to accurately represent out-of-domain queries. In this paper, we introduce a framework that refines instance-level query representations at test time, with only the signals coming from the intermediate retrieval results. We optimize the query representation based on the retrieval result similar to pseudo  Cites: Latent retrieval for weakly supervised open domain question
