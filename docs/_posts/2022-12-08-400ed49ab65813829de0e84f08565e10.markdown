1.1 Deep Learning for Recommender Systems Recommender systems [1, 2, 6] become prevalent nowadays in online platforms, which help users to discover potential items of their interests. Existing works [3, 7–9] jointly train user/item embeddings and the prediction model, which effectively recognize both user and item characteristics, and thus being able to recommend relevant items to users. The developments of deep neural networks, from convolutional neural networks …
