Abstract The number of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) designs is rapidly increasing and certain concerns are raised on how to start an AI design for edge systems, what are the steps to follow and what are the critical pieces towards the most optimal performance. The complete development flow undergoes two distinct phases; training and inference. During training, all the weights are calculated through optimization and back propagation of the network. The training phase is Cites: Input selection for fast feature engineering
