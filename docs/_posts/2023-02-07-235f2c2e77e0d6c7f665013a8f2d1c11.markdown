One of the main processes in most natural language processing (NLP), is named entity recognition (NER). In this regard, some machine learning techniques have been presented that traditionally use manual features. Also, in recent years, deep neural network-based models have been proposed that achieve higher accuracy without relying on huge computations for feature engineering. Thus, in this article, we employ a combination of two deep learning models to capture the properties of the …
