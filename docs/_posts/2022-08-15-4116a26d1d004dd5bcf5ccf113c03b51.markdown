Nowadays, due to the constantly growing amount of textual information, automatic text summarization constitutes an important research area in natural language processing. In this work, we present a novel framework that combines semantic graph representations along with deep learning predictions to generate abstractive summaries of single documents, in an effort to utilize a semantic representation of the unstructured textual content in a machine-readable, structured, and concise manner Cites: Evaluating the factual consistency of abstractive text summarization
