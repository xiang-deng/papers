Motivation Drug response prediction (DRP) plays an important role in precision medicine (eg, for cancer analysis and treatment). Recent advances in deep learning algorithms make it possible to predict drug responses accurately based on genetic profiles. However, existing methods ignore the potential relationships among genes. In addition, similarity among cell lines/drugs was rarely considered explicitly. Results We propose a novel DRP framework, called TGSA, to make better use of prior Cites: Strategies for pre-training graph neural networks
