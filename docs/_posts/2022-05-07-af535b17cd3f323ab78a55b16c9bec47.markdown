In spoken question answering, the systems are designed to answer questions from contiguous text spans within the related speech transcripts. However, the most natural way that human seek or test their knowledge is via human conversations. Therefore, we propose a new Spoken Conversational Question Answering task (SCQA), aiming at enabling the systems to model complex dialogue flows given the speech documents. In this task, our main objective is to build the system to deal with Cites: Coqa: A conversational question answering challenge
