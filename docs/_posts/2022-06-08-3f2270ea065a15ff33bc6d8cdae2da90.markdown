Deep learning algorithms or ensemble machine learning models often increase accuracy in industry artificial intelligence applications. However, their complexity makes them difficult to understand and show their underlying logic and decisions. In safety-critical applications or for audit purposes, this opaqueness is undesirable. To this end, explainable artificial intelligence techniques attempt to show how these complex models work. One of these techniques is the global surrogate generation Cites: " Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any
