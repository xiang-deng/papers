Benign overfitting , where classifiers memorize noisy training data yet still achieve a good generalization performance, has drawn great attention in the machine learning community. To explain this surprising phenomenon, a series of works have provided theoretical justification in over-parameterized linear regression, classification, and kernel methods. However, it is not clear if benign overfitting still occurs in the presence of adversarial examples, ie, examples with tiny and intentional Cites: Understanding and mitigating the tradeoff between robustness and
