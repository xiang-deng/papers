Long document classification (LDC) has been a focused interest in natural language processing (NLP) recently with the exponential increase of publications. Based on the pretrained language models, many LDC methods have been proposed and achieved considerable progression. However, most of the existing methods model long documents as sequences of text while omitting the document structure, thus limiting the capability of effectively representing long texts carrying structure Cites: Scirex: A challenge dataset for document-level information extraction
