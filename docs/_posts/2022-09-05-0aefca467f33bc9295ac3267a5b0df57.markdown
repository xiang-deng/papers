In the context of aircraft system performance assessment, deep learning technologies allow us to quickly infer models from experimental measurements, with less detailed system knowledge than usually required by physics-based modeling. However, this inexpensive model development also comes with new challenges regarding model trustworthiness. This article presents a novel approach, physics-guided adversarial machine learning (ML), which improves the confidence over the Cites: Word-level Textual Adversarial Attacking as Combinatorial
