Abstract Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is attracting the increasing attention of materials community for its excellent capability of generating required contents. With the introduction of Prompt paradigm and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), GAI shifts from the task-specific to general pattern gradually, enabling to tackle multiple complicated tasks involved in resolving the structure-activity relationships. Here, we review the development status of GAI …
