To fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the variation of TiO 2 film thickness elicits contrary effects on the light-harvesting and charge transfer, thereby affecting cell performance. To compromise the TiO 2 thickness on the two effects, tandem DSSCs constructed by stacking two cells in series were proposed herein. Cells with high transparent photoelectrodes and counter electrodes were employed as the top cells; thus, the light unabsorbed by the top cells can be transmitted through, and Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
