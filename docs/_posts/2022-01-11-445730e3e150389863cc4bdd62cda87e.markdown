Solute descriptors have been widely used to model chemical transfer processes through poly-parameter linear free energy relationships (pp-LFERs); however, there are still substantial difficulties in obtaining these descriptors accurately and quickly for new organic chemicals. In this research, models (PaDEL-DNN) that require only SMILES of chemicals were built to satisfactorily estimate pp-LFER descriptors using deep neural networks (DNN) and the PaDEL chemical representation.
