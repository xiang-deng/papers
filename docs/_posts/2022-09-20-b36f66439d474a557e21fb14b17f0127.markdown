Feedback comment generation is the task of generating explanatory notes for language learners. Although various generation techniques are available, little is known about which methods are appropriate for this task.

Retrieval-based methods have limitations in that they can only output feedback comments existing in the given training data Cites: Simple and effective retrieve-edit-rerank text generation
