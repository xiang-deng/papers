Abstract The conventional Relation Extraction (RE) task involves identifying whether relations exist between two entities in a given sentence and determining their relation types. However, the complexity of practical application scenarios and the flexibility of natural language demand the ability to extract nested relations, ie, the recognized relation triples may be components of the higher-level relations. Previous studies have highlighted several challenges that affect the nested RE task, including  Cites: SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings
