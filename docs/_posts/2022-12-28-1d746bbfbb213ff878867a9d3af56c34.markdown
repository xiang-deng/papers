A robust multi-step TBM attitude prediction approach named convolutional gated-recurrent-unit neural network (C-GRU) is proposed in this research and the random balance design Fourier amplitude sensitivity test method is used for sensitivity analysis to reveal the interaction between input and output of the C-GRU model. A tunnel construction project in Singapore is taken as an example to prove the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
