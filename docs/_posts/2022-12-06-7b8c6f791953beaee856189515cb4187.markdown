With the wide application of knowledge graph such as recommendation system and text analysis, it is particularly important to create high-quality knowledge graph, it requires precise knowledge graph fusion. As a key part of knowledge graph fusion, entity alignment can provide more prior knowledge for knowledge graph and improve its usability. In order to obtain a more global graph structure feature, this paper designs a subgraph matching based method for entity alignment, named …
