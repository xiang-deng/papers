Spreadsheets contain a lot of valuable data and have many practical applications. The key technology of these practical applications is how to make machines understand the semantic structure of spreadsheets, eg, identifying cell function types and discovering relationships between cell pairs. Most existing methods for understanding the semantic structure of spreadsheets do not make use of the semantic information of cells. A few studies do, but they ignore the layout structure  Cites: Spreadsheet property detection with rule-assisted active learning
