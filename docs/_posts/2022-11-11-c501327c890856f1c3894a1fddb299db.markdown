The recent breakthrough of foundation model (FM) research raises a new trend to acquire efficient DL models by fine-tuning FMs with low-resource datasets. Current GPU clusters are mainly established to develop DL models by training from scratch. How to tailor a GPU cluster scheduler for FM fine-tuning workloads is still not explored. We propose Titan, a scheduler to improve the efficiency of FM fine-tuning workloads based on their three distinct features.(1) It takes full advantage of the fixed …
