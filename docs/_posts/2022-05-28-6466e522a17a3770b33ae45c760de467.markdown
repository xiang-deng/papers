We introduce Housekeep, a benchmark to evaluate commonsense reasoning in the home for embodied AI. In Housekeep, an embodied agent must tidy a house by rearranging misplaced objects without explicit instructions specifying which objects need to be rearranged. Instead, the agent must learn from and is evaluated against human preferences of which objects belong where in a tidy house. Specifically, we collect a dataset of where humans typically place objects in tidy and untidy houses  Cites: Abductive commonsense reasoning
