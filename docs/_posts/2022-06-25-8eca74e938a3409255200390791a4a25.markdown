Automatic API recommendation has been studied for years. There are two orthogonal lines of approaches for this task, ie, information-retrieval-based (IR-based) and neural-based methods. Although these approaches were reported having remarkable performance, our observation shows that existing approaches can fail due to the following two reasons: 1) most IR-based approaches treat task queries as bag-of-words and use word embedding to represent queries, which …
