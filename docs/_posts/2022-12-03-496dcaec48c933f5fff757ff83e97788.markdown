Posterior collapse, also known as the Kullback-Leibler (KL) vanishing, is a long-standing problem in variational recurrent autoencoder (VRAE) which is essentially developed for sequence generation. To alleviate the vanishing problem, a complicated latent variable is required instead of assuming it as standard Gaussian. Normalizing flow was proposed to build the bijective neural network which converts a simple distribution into a complex distribution. The resulting approximate posterior is  Cites: Spherical Latent Spaces for Stable Variational Autoencoders
