Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a subtask of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) that considers each opinion term, their expressed sentiment, and the corresponding aspect targets. However, existing methods are limited to the in-domain setting with two domains. Hence, we propose a domain-expanded benchmark to address the in-domain, out-of-domain and cross-domain settings. We support the new benchmark by annotating more than 4000 data samples for two new Cites: Adaptive recursive neural network for target-dependent twitter
