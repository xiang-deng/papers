The faults from the spindle motor of CNC machines result in excessive vibration affecting the manufacturing quality. In-situ signals of intact motors are complex and nonlinear due to coupling of multiple subsystems. The manufacturing and assembly errors lead to individual differences resulting in more challenging fault detection of motor systems compared with detection of disassembly parts in an experimental environment. In this paper, an in-situ fault diagnosis method via the multi-stage …
