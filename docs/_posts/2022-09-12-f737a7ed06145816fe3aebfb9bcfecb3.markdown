Cross-domain sentiment analysis has recently attracted significant attention, which can effectively alleviate the problem of lacking large-scale labeled data for deep neural network based methods. However, most of the existing cross-domain sentiment classification models neglect the domain-specific features, which limits their performance especially when the domain discrepancy becomes larger. Meanwhile, the relations between the aspect and opinion terms cannot be effectively Cites: Cached Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks for Document
