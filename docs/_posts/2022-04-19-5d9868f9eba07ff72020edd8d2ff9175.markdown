There is progress to be made in building artificially intelligent systems to detect abnormalities that are not only accurate but can handle the true breadth of findings that radiologists encounter in body (chest, abdomen, and pelvis) computed tomography (CT). Currently, the major bottleneck for developing multi-disease classifiers is a lack of manually annotated data. The purpose of this work was to develop high throughput multi-label annotators for body CT reports that can be Cites: Learning sentiment-specific word embedding for twitter sentiment
