Inductive link prediction (ILP) is to predict links for unseen entities in emerging knowledge graphs (KGs), considering the evolving nature of KGs. A more challenging scenario is that emerging KGs consist of only unseen entities, called as disconnected emerging KGs (DEKGs). Existing studies for DEKGs only focus on predicting enclosing links, ie, predicting links inside the emerging KG. The bridging links, which carry the evolutionary information from the original KG to DEKG, have  Cites: Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text
