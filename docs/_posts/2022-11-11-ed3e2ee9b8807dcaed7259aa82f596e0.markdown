Indoor localization systems with higher precision and integrity are being highly demanded because of their numerous applications in superstores, smart homes, smart cities, elderly care, and disaster management. Although there are many technologies for indoor positioning eg, Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), the high precision localization is still challenging because of the multipath effect and non-line of sight  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
