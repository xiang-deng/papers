Wood formation involves sequential developmental events requiring the coordination of multiple hormones. Brassinosteroids (BRs) play a key role in wood development, but little is known about the cellular and molecular processes that underlie wood formation in tree species. Here, we generated transgenic poplar lines with edited PdBRI1 genes, which are orthologs of Arabidopsis vascular-enriched BR receptors, and showed how inhibition of BR signaling influences wood development at the Cites: BRL1 and BRL3 are novel brassinosteroid receptors that function
