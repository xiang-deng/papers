Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have made significant progress in NLP. However, their ability to memorize, represent, and leverage commonsense knowledge has been a well-known pain point for LLMs. It remains unclear that:(1) Can GPTs effectively answer commonsense questions?(2) Are GPTs knowledgeable in commonsense?(3) Are GPTs aware of the underlying commonsense knowledge for answering a specific question?(4) Can GPTs  Cites: Generated knowledge prompting for commonsense reasoning
