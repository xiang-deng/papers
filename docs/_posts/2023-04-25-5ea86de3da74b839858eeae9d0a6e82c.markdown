Much of our understanding of word meaning has been informed through studies of single words. High-dimensional semantic space models have recently proven instrumental in elucidating connections between words. Here we show how bigram semantic distance can yield novel insights into conceptual cohesion and topic flow when computed over continuous language samples. For example,Cats drink milk is comprised of an ordered vector of bigrams (cat-drink, drink-milk). Each of these Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
