Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) are essential for visualizing, understanding and analyzing program behavior. For statically-typed programming language like Java, developers obtain CFGs by using bytecode-based methods for compilable code and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based methods for partially uncompilable code. However, explicit syntax errors during AST construction and implicit semantic errors caused by bad coding practices can lead to behavioral loss and deviation of CFGs  Cites: AI Chains: Transparent and Controllable Human-AI Interaction by
