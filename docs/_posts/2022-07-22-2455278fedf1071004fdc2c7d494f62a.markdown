For highly distributed environments such as edge computing, collaborative learning approaches eschew the dependence on a global, shared model, in favor of models tailored for each location. Creating tailored models for individual learning contexts reduces the amount of data transfer, while collaboration among peers provides acceptable model performance. Collaboration assumes, however, the availability of knowledge transfer mechanisms, which are not trivial for deep learning models Cites: The ai economist: Improving equality and productivity with ai
