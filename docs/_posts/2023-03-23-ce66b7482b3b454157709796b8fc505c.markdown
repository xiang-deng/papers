Recent works with the BERT-based models demonstrate their generalization ability and high performance on the new domain tasks. However, this kind of model requires a large amount of data. Collecting this data can be error-prone, and it is important to know: how the errors in data affect the quality of the model. In this work, we study the impact of data with different errors-noisy data on the training of the question answering-over-text BERT-model. We use the concept of random Cites: Latent retrieval for weakly supervised open domain question
