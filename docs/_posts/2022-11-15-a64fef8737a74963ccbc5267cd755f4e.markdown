Loops with multiple phases are challenging to verify because they require disjunctive invariants. Invariants could also have the form of implication between a precondition for the phase and a lemma that is valid throughout the phase. Such invariant structure is however not widely supported in state-of-the-art verification. We present a novel SMT-based approach to synthesize implication invariants for multi-phase loops. Our technique computes Model Based Projections to discover the program s …
