Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the core techniques in AI software. As AI is being applied to more and more domains, how to efficiently develop high-quality domain-specific language models becomes a critical question in AI software engineering. Existing domain-specific language model development processes mostly focus on learning a domain-specific pre-trained language model (PLM); when training the domain task-specific language model based on PLM, only a direct (and …
