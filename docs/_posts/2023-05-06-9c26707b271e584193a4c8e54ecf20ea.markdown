Weakly supervised semantic segmentation with weak labels is a long-lived ill-posed problem. Mainstream methods mainly focus on improving the quality of pseudo labels. In this report, we attempt to explore the potential of prompt to masks  from the powerful class-agnostic large segmentation model, segment-anything. Specifically, different weak labels are used as prompts to the segment-anything model, generating precise class masks. The class masks are utilized to generate pseudo …
