Despite the proliferation of research on how people engage with and experience algorithmic systems, the materiality and physicality of these experiences is often overlooked. We tend to forget about bodies. The Embodying the Algorithm1 project worked with artists to explore the experience of translating algorithmically produced performance instructions through human bodies. As performers interpreted the rules of engagement produced by GPT-3, they struggled with the lack of consideration the  Cites: What Did My AI Learn? How Data Scientists Make Sense of Model
