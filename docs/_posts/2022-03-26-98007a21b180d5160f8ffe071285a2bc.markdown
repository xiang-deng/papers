We propose a theoretical framework of multi-way similarity to model real-valued data into hypergraphs for clustering via spectral embedding. For graph cut based spectral clustering, it is common to model real-valued data into graph by modeling pairwise similarities using kernel function. This is because the kernel function has a theoretical connection to the graph cut. For problems where using multi-way similarities are more suitable than pairwise ones, it is natural to model as a Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
