Automatizing the process of understanding the global narrative structure of long texts and stories is still a major challenge for state-of-the-art natural language understanding systems, particularly because annotated data is scarce and existing annotation workflows do not scale well to the annotation of complex narrative phenomena. In this work, we focus on the identification of narrative levels in texts corresponding to stories that can be embedded (stories within stories) or otherwise Cites: SwitchOut: an Efficient Data Augmentation Algorithm for Neural
