Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) that maps entities and relations into vector representations is essential for downstream tasks. Conventional KGE methods require relatively high-dimensional entity representations to preserve the structural information of knowledge graph, but lead to oversized model parameters. Recent methods reduce model parameters by adopting low-dimensional entity representations, while developing techniques (eg, knowledge distillation) to …
