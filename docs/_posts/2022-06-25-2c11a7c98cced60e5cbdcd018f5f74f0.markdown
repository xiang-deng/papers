Conventional size object detection has been extensively studied, whereas researches concerning ultrasmall object detection are rare due to lack of dataset. Here, considering that the stapes in the ear is the smallest bone in our body, we have collected the largest stapedial otosclerosis detection dataset from 633 stapedial otosclerosis patients and 269 normal cases to promote this direction. Nevertheless, noisy classification labels in our dataset are inevitable due to various subjective and
