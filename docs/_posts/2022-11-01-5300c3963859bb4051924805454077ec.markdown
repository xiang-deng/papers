Detecting humor is an NLP task needed in many areas, including marketing, politics, and news. However, such a task is challenging due to the context, emotion, culture, and rhythm. To address this problem, we have proposed a robust model called BFHumor, a BERT-Flair-based Humor detection model that detects humor through  Cites: A structural probe for finding syntax in word representations
