Deep neural networks have achieved good performance in recent years for aspect-level sentiment classification (ASC), whereas most neural ASC models neglect the commonsense knowledge absent from text but essential for aspect affective understanding, which largely limits the performance of neural ASC. In this paper, we propose a Weakly Supervised Knowledge Attentive Network, which resolves the above problems via knowledge attention and weakly supervised learning Cites: Aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network
