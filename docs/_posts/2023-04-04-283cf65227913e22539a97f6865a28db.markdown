Indoor localization is an active area of research dominated by traditional machine-learning techniques. Deep learning-based systems have shown unprecedented improvements and have accomplished exceptional results over the past decade, especially the Transformer network within natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision domains. We propose the hyper-class Transformer (HyTra), an encoder-only Transformer with multiple classification heads (one per class) and …
