Condition monitoring of road surfaces has acquired a lot of attention in the field of computer vision throughout the years. It is due to two main reasons; firstly, it produces safety and comfort to the community, and secondly, it causes less damage to the vehicles for an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). To this extent, this article aims to present a real-time vision-based approach that automatically segments the road anomalies from the drivable area.
