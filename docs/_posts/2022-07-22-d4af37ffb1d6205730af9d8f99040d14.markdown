The topic of knowledge-based question answering (KBQA) has attracted wide attention for a long period. A series of techniques have been developed, especially for simple questions. To answer complex questions, most existing approaches apply a semantic parsing-based strategy that parses a question into a query graph for result identification. However, due to poor quality, query graphs often lead to incorrect answers. To tackle the issue, we propose a comprehensive approach for  Cites: Imitation learning of agenda-based semantic parsers
