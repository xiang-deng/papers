Integrated data analysis (IDA) pipelines---that combine data management (DM) and query processing, high-performance computing (HPC), and machine learning (ML) training and scoring---become increasingly common in practice. Interestingly, systems of these areas share many compilation and runtime techniques, and the used---increasingly heterogeneous---hardware infrastructure converges as well. Yet, the programming paradigms, cluster resource management, data formats and Cites: Adapting to source properties in processing data integration queries
