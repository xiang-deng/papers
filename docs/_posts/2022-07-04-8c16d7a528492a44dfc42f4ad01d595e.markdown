Neural retrieval models are often trained on (subsets of) the millions of queries of the MS MARCO/ORCAS datasets and then tested on the 250 Robust04 queries or other TREC benchmarks with often only 50 queries. In such setups, many of the few test queries can be very similar to queries from the huge training datain fact, 69% of the Robust04 queries have near-duplicates in MS MARCO/ORCAS. We investigate the impact of this unintended traintest leakage by training neural retrieval models on  Cites: Multi-stage document ranking with BERT
