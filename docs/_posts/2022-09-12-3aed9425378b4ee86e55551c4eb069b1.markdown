Background The application of machine learning algorithms for assessing the auditory brainstem response has gained interest over recent years with a considerable number of publications in the literature. In this systematic review, we explore how machine learning has been used to develop algorithms to assess auditory brainstem responses. A clear and comprehensive overview is provided to allow clinicians and researchers to explore the domain and the potential translation Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
