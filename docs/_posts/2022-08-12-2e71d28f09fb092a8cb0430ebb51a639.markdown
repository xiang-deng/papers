A probabilistic regression model provides decision-makers with the regression output along with its quantitative uncertainty for given input variables. Even though this uncertainty may help to avoid serious consequences such as misdiagnosis or blackout due to overconfidence in the output, it only provides a measure of the uncertainty of the output, and has a limitation in that it cannot explain the reasons for the output and its uncertainty. If they can be presented along with their reasons, more Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
