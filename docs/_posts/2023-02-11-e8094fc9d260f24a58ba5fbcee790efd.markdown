The wide spread of false information has detrimental effects on society, and false information detection has received wide attention. When new domains appear, the relevant labeled data is scarce, which brings severe challenges to the detection. Previous work mainly leverages additional data or domain adaptation technology to assist detection. The former would lead to a severe data burden; the latter underutilizes the pre-trained language model because there is a gap between the  Cites: Compare to the knowledge: Graph neural fake news detection with
