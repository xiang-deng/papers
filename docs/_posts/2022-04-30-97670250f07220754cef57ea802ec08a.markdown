Due to the heterogeneity gap, the data representations of different types of media are inconsistent. It is challenging to measure the fine-grained gap between different media. To this end, we propose a self-attention-based hybrid network to learn the common representations of different media data. Specifically, we first utilize a local self-attention layer to learn the common attention space between different media data. Then we propose a similarity concatenation method to understand the content Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
