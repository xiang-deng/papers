Background: Databases are fundamental to advance biomedical science. However, most of them are populated and updated with a great deal of human e ort. Biomedical Relation Extraction (BioRE) aims to shift this burden to machines. Among its di erent applications, the discovery of Gene-Disease Associations (GDAs) is one of BioRE most relevant tasks. Nevertheless, few resources have been developed to train models for GDA extraction. Besides, these resources are all limited in size Cites: Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text
