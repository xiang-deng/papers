We study a bilevel economic system, which we refer to as a Markov exchange economy (MEE), from the point of view of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). An MEE involves a central planner and a group of self-interested agents. The goal of the agents is to form a Competitive Equilibrium (CE), where each agent myopically maximizes her own utility at each step. The goal of the central planner is to steer the system so as to maximize social welfare, which is defined as the sum of the utilities of  Cites: The AI Economist: Optimal Economic Policy Design via Two-level
