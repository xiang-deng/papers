To meet the ever-increasing computation demand from emerging workloads, a scalable design paradigm combines multiple Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerators to build a large multi-accelerator system. They are mainly proposed for data centers, where workload varies across vision, language, recommendation, etc. Existing works independently explore their hardware configuration and mapping strategies due to the extremely large cross-coupled design space. However …
