Resilience can be defined as a system s capability for returning to normal operation after having suffered a disruption. This notion is of the foremost interest in many areas, in particular engineering. We argue in this position paper that is a crucial property for bioinspired optimization algorithms as well. Following a computer system perspective, we correlate some of the defining requirements for attaining resilient systems to issues, features, and mechanisms of these techniques. It is shown that Cites: Green AI
