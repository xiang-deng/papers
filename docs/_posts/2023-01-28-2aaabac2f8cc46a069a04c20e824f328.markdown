Today s probabilistic language generators fall short when it comes to producing coherent and fluent text despite the fact that the underlying models perform well under standard metrics (eg, perplexity). This discrepancy has puzzled the language generation community for the last few years. In this work, we posit that the abstraction of natural language generation as a discrete stochastic processwhich allows for an information-theoretic analysiscan provide new insights into the behavior of  Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
