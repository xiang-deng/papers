This preliminary proposal for the implementation of a mid-scale RI-1 outlines a plan to design, build, and deploy computing infrastructure for deep inference, to enable and propel American academic research to advance scientific understanding of state-of-the-art very large language models, which now dominate artificial intelligence (AI). The NDIF proposal consists of: 1. Development of open-source software that will enable deep inference research on very large language models, a critical research …
