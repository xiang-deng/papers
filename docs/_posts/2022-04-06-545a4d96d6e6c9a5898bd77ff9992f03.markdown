Currently, identification of complex human activities is experiencing exponential growth through the use of deep learning algorithms. Conventional strategies for recognizing human activity generally rely on handcrafted characteristics from heuristic processes in time and frequency domains. The advancement of deep learning algorithms has addressed most of these issues by automatically extracting features from multimodal sensors to correctly classify human physical activity.
