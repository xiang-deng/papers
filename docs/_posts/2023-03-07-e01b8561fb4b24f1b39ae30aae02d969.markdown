Deep learning has emerged as a new engine for many of today s artificial intelligence/machine learning systems, leading to several recent breakthroughs in vision and natural language processing tasks. However, as we move into the era of deep learning with billions and even trillions of parameters, meeting the computational and memory requirements to train and serve state-of-the-art models has become extremely challenging. Optimizing the computational cost and memory …
