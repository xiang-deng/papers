Answering multi-relation questions over knowledge graphs is a challenging task as it requires multi-step reasoning over a huge number of possible paths. Reasoning-based methods with complex reasoning mechanisms, such as reinforcement learning-based sequential decision making, have been regarded as the default pathway for this task. However, these mechanisms are difficult to implement and train, which hampers their reproducibility and transferability to new domains. In this Cites: Semantic parsing via paraphrasing
