Heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance on node classification tasks in a semi-supervised learning setting. However, as in the simpler homogeneous GNN case, message-passing-based heterogeneous GNNs may struggle to balance between resisting the oversmoothing occuring in deep models and capturing long-range dependencies graph structured data. Moreover, the complexity of this trade-off is compounded in the heterogeneous graph case due to Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
