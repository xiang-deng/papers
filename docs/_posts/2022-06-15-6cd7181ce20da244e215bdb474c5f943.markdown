The idea of combining the active query strategy and the passive-aggressive (PA) update strategy in online learning can be credited to the PA active (PAA) algorithm, which has proven to be effective in learning linear classifiers from datasets with a fixed feature space. We propose a novel family of online active learning algorithms, named PAA learning for trapezoidal data streams (PAA $ _ {\text {TS}} $) and multiclass PAA $ _ {\text {TS}} $(MPAA $ _ {\text {TS}} $)(and their variants), for binary  Cites: Online latent Dirichlet allocation with infinite vocabulary
