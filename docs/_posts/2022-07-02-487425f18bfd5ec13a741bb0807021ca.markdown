On e-commerce platforms, predicting if two products are compatible with each other is an important functionality to achieve trustworthy product recommendation and search experience for consumers. However, accurately predicting product compatibility is difficult due to the heterogeneous product data and the lack of manually curated training data. We study the problem of discovering effective labeling rules that can enable weakly-supervised product compatibility prediction  Cites: Knowledgeable Prompt-tuning: Incorporating Knowledge into
