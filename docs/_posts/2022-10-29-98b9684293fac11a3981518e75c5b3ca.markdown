Large-scale generative models are increasingly being used in tooling applications. As one prominent example, code generation models, such as Copilot [8], CodeWhisperer [1], and AlphaCode [7], recommend code completions within an IDE to help programmers author software. However, since these models are imperfect, their erroneous recommendations can introduce bugs or even security vulnerabilities into a code base if not overridden by a human user [14].
