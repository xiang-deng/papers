Deep neural networks based on layer-stacking architectures have historically suffered from poor inherent interpretability. Meanwhile, symbolic probabilistic models function with clear interpretability, but how to combine them with neural networks to enhance their performance remains to be explored. In this paper, we try to marry these two systems for text classification via a structured language model. We propose a Symbolic-Neural model that can learn to explicitly predict class labels of  Cites: Multiple instance learning networks for fine-grained sentiment
