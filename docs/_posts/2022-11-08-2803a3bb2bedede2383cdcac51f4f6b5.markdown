We present a novel methodology for neural network backdoor attacks. Unlike existing training-time attacks where the Trojaned network would respond to the Trojan trigger after training, our approach inserts a Trojan that will remain dormant until it is activated. The activation is realized through a specific perturbation to the network s weight parameters only known to the attacker. Our analysis and the experimental results demonstrate that dormant Trojaned networks can effectively …
