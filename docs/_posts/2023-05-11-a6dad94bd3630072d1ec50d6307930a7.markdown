Instruction tuning has been shown to be able to improve cross-task generalization of language models. However, it is still challenging for language models to complete the target tasks following the instructions, as the instructions are general and lack intermediate steps. To address this problem, we propose to incorporate the step-by-step instructions to help language models to decompose the tasks, which can provide the detailed and specific procedures for completing the target tasks. The step …
