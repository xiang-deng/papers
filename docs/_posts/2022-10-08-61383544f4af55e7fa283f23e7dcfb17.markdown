Existing hybrid retrievers which integrate sparse and dense retrievers, are indexing-heavy, limiting their applicability in real-world on-devices settings. We ask the question Is it possible to reduce the indexing memory of hybrid retrievers without sacrificing performance? Driven by this question, we leverage an indexing-efficient dense retriever (ie DrBoost) to obtain a light hybrid retriever. Moreover, to further reduce the memory, we introduce a lighter dense retriever (LITE) which is jointly  Cites: Sparse, dense, and attentional representations for text retrieval
