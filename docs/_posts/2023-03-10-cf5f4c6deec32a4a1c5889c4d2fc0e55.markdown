We propose Adversarial DEep Learning Transpiler (ADELT) for source-to-source transpilation between deep learning frameworks. Unlike prior approaches, we decouple the transpilation of code skeletons and the mapping of API keywords (an API function name or a parameter name). ADELT transpile code skeletons using few-shot prompting on big language models. Based on contextual embeddings extracted by a BERT for code, we train aligned API embeddings in a domain-adversarial setup Cites: Codebleu: a method for automatic evaluation of code synthesis
