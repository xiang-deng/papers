Automated code summarization tools allow generating descriptions for code snippets in natural language, which benefits software development and maintenance. Recent studies demonstrate that the quality of generated summaries can be improved by using additional code representations beyond token sequences. The majority of contemporary approaches mainly focus on extracting code syntactic and structural information from abstract syntax trees (ASTs). However, from the view of macro Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
