We understand literary machine translation as an emerging interdisciplinary field that embraces a range of phenomena related to the application of MT to the translation of literary texts. It touches upon or intersects with, among other areas: speculative and empirical enquiry into the features that make literary texts particularly amenable to or (more often) difficult for MT computational techniques that might meet the attendant challenges the application of generic MT to literary texts the  Cites: Large language models effectively leverage document-level
