In recent years, machine learning has achieved impressive results across different application areas. However, machine learning algorithms do not necessarily perform well on a new domain with a different distribution than its training set. Domain Adaptation (DA) is used to mitigate this problem. One approach of existing DA algorithms is to find domain invariant features whose distributions in the source domain are the same as their distribution in the target domain. In this paper, we …
