Abstract Information access systems have supported people during tasks across a variety of domains. In this perspective paper, we advocate for broadening the scope of information access research to include machines. We believe that machine learning can be substantially advanced by developing a research program around retrieval as a core algorithmic method. This paper describes how core principles of indexing, representation, retrieval, and relevance can extend supervised learning Cites: Latent retrieval for weakly supervised open domain question
