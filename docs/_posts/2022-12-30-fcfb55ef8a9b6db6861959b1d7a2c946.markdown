Remarkable progress has been made on automated reasoning with knowledge specified as unstructured, natural text, by using the power of large language models (LMs) coupled with methods such as Chain-of-Thought prompting and Selection-Inference. These techniques search for proofs in the forward direction from axioms to the conclusion, which suffers from a combinatorial explosion of the search space, and thus high failure rates for problems requiring longer chains of reasoning. The …
