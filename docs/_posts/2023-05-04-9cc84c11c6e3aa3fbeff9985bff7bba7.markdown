The field of machine learning (ML) has gained widespread adoption, leading to a significant demand for adapting ML to specific scenarios, which is yet expensive and non-trivial. The predominant approaches towards the automation of solving ML tasks (eg, AutoML) are often time consuming and hard to understand for human developers. In contrast, though human engineers have the incredible ability to understand tasks and reason about solutions, their experience and knowledge are Cites: Rethinking the Role of Demonstrations: What Makes In-Context
