Despite recent explosion in research interests, in-context learning and the precise impact of the quality of demonstrations remain elusive. While, based on current literature, it is expected that in-context learning shares a similar mechanism to supervised learning, Min et al.(2022) recently reported that, surprisingly, input-label correspondence is less important than other aspects of prompt demonstrations. Inspired by this counter-intuitive observation, we re-examine the importance of … Cites: ‪An Explanation of In-context Learning as Implicit Bayesian Inference‬
