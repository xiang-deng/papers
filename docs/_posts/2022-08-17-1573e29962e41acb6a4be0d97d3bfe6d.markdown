The most notable neural data-to-text approaches generate natural language from structural data relying on the surface form of the structural content, which ignores the underlying logical correlation between the input data and the target text. Moreover, identifying such logical associations and explaining them in natural language is desirable but not yet studied. In this paper, we introduce a practical data-to-text method for the logic-critical scenario, specifically for anti-money laundering Cites: A global model for concept-to-text generation
