With the success of pre-trained language models, the performance of story ending generation has been dramatically improved while remaining challenging due to the lack of commonsense reasoning ability. Most previous works mainly focus on using commonsense knowledge to enhance the implicit correlations between words but ignore the hidden causality of sentences or events. In this paper, we propose C ausal commonsense E nhanced joint model for story ending G eneration (CEG), which Cites: Grounded conversation generation as guided traverses in
