To solve the incompleteness problem in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) and to discover the new knowledge, TKG completion remains an essential task always solved by graph embedding technology. Existing TKG completion methods encode time at only single granularity, which is insufficient in exploiting the rich information of distinct time granularities. Furthermore, most of them lack a comprehensive consideration of the characteristic of both time points and time periods, resulting in Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
