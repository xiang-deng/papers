BERT and GPT3 make possible the Natural Language Processing of Geosciences reports at an other level. Today, legacy documents can be turned in a source of actionnable data to built chabots, classify documents automatically according their content or to search for the key data, information and knowledge within the documents. This paper will discuss about the advantages of the transformers algorithms to capture the meaning of the technical reports and the possibility to tune Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
