Event classification (EC) aims to assign the event labels to unlabeled sentences and tends to struggle in real-world applications when only a few annotated samples are available. Previous studies have mainly focused on using meta-learning to overcome the low-resource problem where label data from other tasks are still required for model learning and selection. Accordingly, prompt learning-based approaches are proposed to address the low-resource issue. However, such approaches generally Cites: Prefix-tuning: Optimizing continuous prompts for generation
