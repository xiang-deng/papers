Most knowledge management (KM) techniques capture knowledge at the end of a project, leading to knowledge loss. Building information modeling (BIM) is a building information management process throughout the project lifecycle. This study uses BIM for lifecycle knowledge capture to address knowledge loss. Knowledge in construction projects is intricate, intensifying the challenges of knowledge retrieval. This study combines natural language processing (NLP) and case-based reasoning Cites: Emergent linguistic structure in artificial neural networks trained by
