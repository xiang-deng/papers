Data fusion enables characterisation of an object using multiple datasets collected by various sensors. To improve optical coordinate measurement using data fusion, researchers have proposed numerous algorithmic solutions and methods. The most popular examples are Gaussian process (GP) and weighted least-squares (WLS) algorithms, which depend on userdefined mathematical models describing the geometric characteristics of the measured object. Existing research on GP and WLS …
