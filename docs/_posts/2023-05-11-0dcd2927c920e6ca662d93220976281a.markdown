Semantic analysis based on knowledge graphs requires a relevant subgraph of a reasonable size. Existing approaches have three issues that impede the integration of such subgraphs.

Second, existing approaches are knowledge-graph-dependent, resulting in outdated knowledge graphs even in recent studies. Third, existing approaches are flawed either in entity linking or path expansion, which often results …
