In artificial intelligence, common sense refers to simple acts of verbal reasoning. The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), an important test of common sense, was recently defeated by transformer-based language models. We investigate the implications of that defeat: have language models achieved common sense, or is the challenge flawed? That is, we consider the problem of reevaluating verbal reasoning in language models. We evaluate the accuracy and consistency on Winograd …
