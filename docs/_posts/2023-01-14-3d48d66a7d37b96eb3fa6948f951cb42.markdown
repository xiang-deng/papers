Recommender systems are important and powerful tools for various personalized services. Traditionally, these systems use data mining and machine learning techniques to make recommendations based on correlations found in the data. However, relying solely on correlation without considering the underlying causal mechanism may lead to various practical issues such as fairness, explainability, robustness, bias, echo chamber and controllability problems. Therefore, researchers  Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
