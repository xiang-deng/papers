On-board system fault knowledge base (KB) is a collection of fault causes, maintenance methods, and interrelationships among on-board modules and components of high-speed railways, which plays a crucial role in knowledge-driven dynamic operation and maintenance (O&M) decisions for on-board systems. To solve the problem of multi-source heterogeneity of on-board system O&M data, an entity matching (EM) approach using the BERT model and semi-supervised …
