Deep learning (DL) models are widely used in software applications. Novel DL models and datasets are published from time to time. Developers may also tempt to apply new software engineering (SE) techniques on their DL models. However, no existing tool supports the applications of software testing and debugging techniques on new DL models and their datasets without modifying the code. Developers should manually write code to glue every combination of models, datasets, and SE …
