The techniques of explainability and interpretability are not alternatives for many realworld problems, as recent studies often suggest. Interpretable machine learning is not a subset of explainable artificial intelligence or vice versa. While the former aims to build glass-box predictive models, the latter seeks to understand a black box using an explanatory model, a surrogate model, an attribution approach, relevance importance, or other statistics. There is concern that definitions, approaches, and  Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
