Abstract Machine learning (ML) systems are rapidly increasing in size, are acquiring new capabilities, and are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings. Like other powerful technologies, safety for ML should be a leading research priority. However, most research discussions about how to improve the safety of ML systems are nebulous, RL-specific, or strictly futuristic. To rectify this, we present four problems ready for research, namely enduring hazards (Robustness), identifying hazards Cites: Verified uncertainty calibration
