Structured sentiment analysis, which aims to extract the complex semantic structures such as holders, expressions, targets, and polarities, has obtained widespread attention from both industry and academia. Unfortunately, the existing structured sentiment analysis datasets refer to a few languages and are relatively small, limiting neural network models  performance. In this paper, we focus on the cross-lingual structured sentiment analysis task, which aims to transfer the knowledge from the  Cites: A language-independent neural network for event detection
