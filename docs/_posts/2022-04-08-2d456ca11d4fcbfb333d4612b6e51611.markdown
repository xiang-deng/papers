The demand for annotated datasets for supervised machine learning (ML) projects is growing rapidly. Annotating a dataset often requires domain experts and is a timely and costly process. A premier method to reduce this overhead drastically is Active Learning (AL). Despite a tremendous potential for annotation cost savings, AL is still not used universally in ML projects. The large number of available AL strategies has significantly risen during the past years leading to an increased demand for thorough Cites: Dataset cartography: Mapping and diagnosing datasets with
