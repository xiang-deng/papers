A binary program is an executable file obtained by compiling the source code. In order to reduce the size of software or prevent reverse engineering, software publishers usually only release executable files that have stripped a lot of source information. The rich source-level information is very helpful for software hardening and malware analysis. In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence has promoted the research of binary program information recovery. This paper …
