In structured prediction, the goal is to jointly predict many output variables that together encode a structured object--a path in a graph, an entity-relation triple, or an ordering of objects. Such a large output space makes learning hard and requires vast amounts of labeled data. Different approaches leverage alternate sources of supervision. One approach--entropy regularization--posits that decision boundaries should lie in low-probability regions. It extracts supervision from unlabeled examples … Cites: ‪Programming with a differentiable forth interpreter‬
