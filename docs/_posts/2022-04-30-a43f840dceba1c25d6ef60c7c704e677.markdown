Joint representations between images and text have been deeply investigated in the literature. In computer vision, the benefits of incorporating natural language have become clear for enabling semantic-level control of images. In this work, we present $ textbf {MolT5}-$ a self-supervised learning framework for pretraining models on a vast amount of unlabeled natural language text and molecule strings. $ textbf {MolT5} $ allows for new, useful, and challenging analogs of traditional vision Cites: Chemical-Reaction-Aware Molecule Representation Learning
