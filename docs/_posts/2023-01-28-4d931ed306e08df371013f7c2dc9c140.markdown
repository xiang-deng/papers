While a vast collection of explainable AI (XAI) algorithms have been developed in recent years, they are often criticized for significant gaps with how humans produce and consume explanations. As a result, current XAI techniques are often found to be hard to use and lack effectiveness. In this work, we attempt to close these gaps by making AI explanations selective--a fundamental property of human explanations--by selectively presenting a subset from a large set of model reasons based on what Cites: Does the whole exceed its parts? the effect of ai explanations on
