Text-based games are a popular testbed for language-based reinforcement learning (RL). In previous work, deep Q-learning is commonly used as the learning agent. Q-learning algorithms are challenging to apply to complex real-world domains due to, for example, their instability in training. Therefore, in this paper, we adapt the soft-actor-critic (SAC) algorithm to the text-based environment. To deal with sparse extrinsic rewards from the environment, we combine it with a potential-based reward Cites: Multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning with reward shaping
