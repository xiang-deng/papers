Formal methods is a field that has a long standing history within Computer Science. At its core, it involves the use of mathematical formalisms to model and reason about computer systems and programs. The application of formal methods to verify that railway signalling systems operate safely and correctly is particularly well established within academia and is now beginning to see real applications within the railway sector. However, many contemporary approaches frequently detect false …
