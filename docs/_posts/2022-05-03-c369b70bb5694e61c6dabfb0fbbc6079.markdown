Cancer is one of the major diseases threatening human life and health worldwide. Epigenetic modification refers to heritable changes in the genetic material without any changes in the nucleic acid sequence and results in heritable phenotypic changes. Epigenetic modifications regulate many biological processes, such as growth, aging, and various diseases, including cancer. With the advancement of next- generation sequencing technology, the role of RNA modifications in cancer Cites: Deep learning-enabled breast cancer hormonal receptor status
