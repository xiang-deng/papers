Electrical motors are widely used in industrial and emerging applications such as electrical automotive. Industrial 4.0 has led to the usage of neural networks for electrical motor tasks like fault detection, monitoring, and control of electrical motors. The growing increase of neural networks in safety-critical systems requires an in-depth analysis of their robustness and stability. This paper studies the robustness of neural networks used in time-series tasks like system modeling, signal denoising  Cites: Predicting Out-of-Domain Generalization with Local Manifold
