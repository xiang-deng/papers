Deep learning excels at learning task information from large amounts of data, but struggles with learning from declarative high-level knowledge that can be more succinctly expressed directly. In this work, we introduce PYLON, a neuro-symbolic training framework that builds on PyTorch to augment procedurally trained models with declaratively specified knowledge. PYLON lets users programmatically specify constraints as Python functions and compiles them into a differentiable loss, thus  Cites: The importance of syntactic parsing and inference in semantic role
