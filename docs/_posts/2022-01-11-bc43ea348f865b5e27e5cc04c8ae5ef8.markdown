Constructing an embedding space for musical instrument sounds that can meaningfully represent new and unseen instruments is important for downstream music generation tasks such as multi-instrument synthesis and timbre transfer. The framework of Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) provides us with architectures and evaluation methodologies for verifying the identities of unseen speakers, and these can be repurposed for the task of learning and evaluating a musical instrument Cites: Codified audio language modeling learns useful representations
