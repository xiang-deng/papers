Free text answers to short questions can reflect students mastery of concepts and their relationships relevant to learning objectives. However, automating the assessment of free text answers has been challenging due to the complexity of natural language. Existing studies often predict the scores of free text answers in a black box manner without analyzing their semantic components, which at least partially limit the prediction performance. In this research, we focus on fine-grained Cites: AllenNLP: A Deep Semantic Natural Language Processing Platform
