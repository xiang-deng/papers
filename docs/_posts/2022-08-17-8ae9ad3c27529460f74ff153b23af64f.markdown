Pre-trained models (PTMs) have become a fundamental backbone for downstream tasks in natural language processing and computer vision. Despite initial gains that were obtained by applying generic PTMs to geo-related tasks at Baidu Maps, a clear performance plateau over time was observed. One of the main reasons for this plateau is the lack of readily available geographic knowledge in generic PTMs. To address this problem, in this paper, we present ERNIE-GeoL, which is a geography Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
