Detecting and reacting to non-technical losses (NTL) is a fundamental activity that energy providers need to face in their daily routines. This is known to be challenging since the phenomenon of NTL is multi-factored, dynamic and extremely contextual, which makes artificial intelligence (AI) and, in particular, machine learning, natural areas to bring effective and tailored solutions. If the human factor is disregarded in the process of detecting NTL, there is a high risk of performance degradation since …
