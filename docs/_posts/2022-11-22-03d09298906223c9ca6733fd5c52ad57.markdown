Path planning is an NP-hard problem in road network environments. Considering that the existing path planning algorithms mainly have the problems of low smoothness and low search efficiency in generating paths in large-scale complex environments, an improved rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm is proposed in this paper. First, the grid method is applied to model the road network environment, and the RRT algorithm based on adjacency expansion is proposed to Cites: Legibility and predictability of robot motion
