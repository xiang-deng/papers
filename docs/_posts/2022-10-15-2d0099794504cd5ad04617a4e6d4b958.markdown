In mental state decoding, researchers aim to identify the set of mental states (eg, experiencing happiness or fear) that can be reliably identified from the activity patterns of a brain region (or network). Deep learning (DL) models are highly promising for mental state decoding because of their unmatched ability to learn versatile representations of complex data. However, their widespread application in mental state decoding is hindered by their lack of interpretability, difficulties in …
