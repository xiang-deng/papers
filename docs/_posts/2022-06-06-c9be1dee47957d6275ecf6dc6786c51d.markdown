Relation prediction for knowledge graphs aims at predicting missing relationships between entities. Inductive relation prediction methods have received increasing attention because of their capability of handling unseen entities. Among the inductive methods, the subgraph-based algorithms have emerged, which inductively predict relations using the subgraph surrounding the target entities. Despite the effectiveness, prior subgraph-based studies rarely focus on the explainability of  Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
