Can a machine learn machine learning? We propose to answer this question using the same criteria we use to answer a similar question: can a human learn machine learning? We automatically answer MIT final exams in Introduction to Machine Learning at a human level. The course is a large undergraduate class with around five hundred students each semester. Recently, program synthesis and few-shot learning solved university-level problem set questions in mathematics and STEM …
