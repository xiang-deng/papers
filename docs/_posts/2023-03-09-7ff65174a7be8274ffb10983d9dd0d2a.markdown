How can we interpret predictions of a workload classification model? A workload is a sequence of operations executed in DRAM, where each operation contains a command and an address. Classifying a given sequence into a correct workload type is important for verifying the quality of DRAM. Although a previous model achieves a reasonable accuracy on workload classification, it is challenging to interpret the prediction results since it is a black box model. A promising direction is to exploit Cites: Contrastive explanations for model interpretability
