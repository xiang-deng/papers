Inductive knowledge graph completion requires models to comprehend the underlying semantics and logic patterns of relations. With the advance of pretrained language models, recent research have designed transformers for link prediction tasks. However, empirical studies show that linearizing triples affects the learning of relational patterns, such as inversion and symmetry. In this paper, we propose Bi-Link, a contrastive learning framework with probabilistic syntax prompts for link Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
