Estimating the difficulty of a dataset typically involves comparing state-of-the-art models to humans; the bigger the performance gap, the harder the dataset is said to be. However, this comparison provides little understanding of how difficult each instance in a given distribution is, or what attributes make the dataset difficult for a given model. To address these questions, we frame dataset difficultywrt a model V as the lack of V-usable information (Xu et al., 2019) Cites: Roberta: a robustly optimized BERT pretraining approach (2019)
