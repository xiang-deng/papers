We conjecture that the inherent difference in generalisation between adaptive and non-adaptive gradient methods in deep learning stems from the increased estimation noise in the flattest directions of the true loss surface. We demonstrate that typical schedules used for adaptive methods (with low numerical stability or damping constants) serve to bias relative movement towards flat directions relative to sharp directions, effectively amplifying the noise-to-signal ratio and harming generalisation …
