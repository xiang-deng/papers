We tackle the question of whether an agent can, by suitable choice of prompts, control an AI bot to any state. To that end, we first introduce a formal definition of``meaning  that is amenable to analysis. Then, we characterize``meaningful data  on which large language models (LLMs) are ostensibly trained, and``well-trained LLMs  through conditions that are largely met by today s LLMs. While a well-trained LLM constructs an embedding space of meanings that is Euclidean …
