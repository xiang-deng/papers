Embodied question answering (EQA) is a recently emerged research field in which an agent is asked to answer the user s questions by exploring the environment and collecting visual information. Plenty of researchers turn their attention to the EQA field due to its broad potential application areas, such as in-home robots, self-driven mobile, and personal assistants. High-level visual tasks, such as EQA, are susceptible to noisy inputs, because they have complex reasoning processes. Before  Cites: Multi-Target Embodied Question Answering
