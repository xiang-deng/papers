Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have revolutionized the computing landscape over the past decade. However, the growing energy demands of data centres and computing facilities equipped with GPUs come with significant capital and environmental costs. The energy consumption of GPU applications greatly depend on how well they are optimized. Auto-tuning is an effective and commonly applied technique of finding the optimal combination of algorithm, application, and hardware Cites: Green AI
