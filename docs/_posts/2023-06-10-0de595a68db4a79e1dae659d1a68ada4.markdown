Large language models (LLMs) encode a vast amount of world knowledge acquired from massive text datasets. Recent studies have demonstrated that LLMs can assist an algorithm agent in solving complex sequential decision making tasks in embodied environments by providing high-level instructions. However, interacting with LLMs can be time-consuming, as in many practical scenarios, they require a significant amount of storage space that can only be deployed on remote cloud server nodes  Cites: Rethinking the Role of Demonstrations: What Makes In-Context
