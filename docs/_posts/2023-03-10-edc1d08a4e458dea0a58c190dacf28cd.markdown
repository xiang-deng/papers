Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have sparked significant interest in their generative capabilities, leading to the development of various commercial applications. The high cost of using the models drives application builders to maximize the value of generation under a limited inference budget. This paper presents a study of optimizing inference hyperparameters like the number of responses, temperature and max tokens, which significantly affects the utility/cost of …
