However, preference-based models assume that individuals:(1) give their preferences only between pairs of objects;(2) are always able to pick the best preferred object. In many situations, they may be instead choosing out of a set with more than two elements and, because of lack of information and/or incomparability (objects with contradictory  Cites: Constraint classification: A new approach to multiclass classification
