The continuous distributions of PM 2.5 concentrations and predictor variables in the surrounding regions influence the PM 2.5 concentrations in the prediction positions notably, yet few machine learning models quantified the spatially continuous interactions between PM 2.5 concentrations and predictor variations, which limits the prediction accuracy. To fill this gap, a Spatial and Temporal Weighted Continuous Deep Neural Network (STWC-DNN) was proposed. For STWC-DNN, three sub Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
