The machine translation system aims to translate source language into target language. Recent studies on MT systems mainly focus on neural machine translation. One factor that significantly affects the performance of NMT is the availability of high-quality parallel corpora. However, high-quality parallel corpora concerning Korean are relatively scarce compared to those associated with other high-resource languages, such as German or Italian. To address this problem, AI …
