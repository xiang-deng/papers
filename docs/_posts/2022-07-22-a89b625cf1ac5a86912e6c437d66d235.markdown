Due to the promising future of Automated Program Repair (APR), researchers have proposed various APR techniques, including heuristic-based, template-based, and constraint-based techniques. Among such classic APR techniques, template-based techniques have been widely recognized as state of the art. However, such template-based techniques require predefined templates to perform repair, and their effectiveness is thus limited. To this end, researchers leveraged the recent advances  Cites: BoolQ: Exploring the surprising difficulty of natural yes/no questions
