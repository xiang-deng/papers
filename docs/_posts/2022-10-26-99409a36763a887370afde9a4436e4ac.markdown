The collection and availability of big data, combined with advances in pre-trained models (eg BERT), have revolutionized the predictive performance of natural language processing tasks. This allows corporations to provide machine learning as a service (MLaaS) by encapsulating fine-tuned BERT-based models as APIs. Due to significant commercial interest, there has been a surge of attempts to steal re mote services via model extraction. Although previous works have made progress in  Cites: Thieves on Sesame Street! Model Extraction of BERT-based APIs
