Programming online judges (POJs) are widely used to train programming skills, and exercise recommendation algorithms in POJs have attracted wide attention. The current programming recommendation algorithms cannot make full use of the feedback of user-item pairs and cannot effectively express students mastery of exercises. Therefore, we propose a dual-track feedback aggregation recommendation model for programming training (DTFARec). In this model, multiple Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
