Data augmentation techniques are widely used in low-resource automatic morphological inflection to address the issue of data sparsity. However, the full implications of these techniques remain poorly understood. In this study, we aim to shed light on the theoretical aspects of the data augmentation strategy StemCorrupt, a method that generates synthetic examples by randomly substituting stem characters in existing gold standard training examples. Our analysis uncovers that Cites: An empirical survey of data augmentation for limited data learning
