Robust learning methods aim to learn a clean target distribution from noisy and corrupted training data where a specific corruption pattern is often assumed a priori. Our proposed method can not only successfully learn the clean target distribution from a dirty dataset but also can estimate the underlying noise pattern. To this end, we leverage a mixture-of-experts model that can distinguish two different types of predictive uncertainty, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. We show that the ability to Cites: Mind your outliers! Investigating the negative impact of outliers on
