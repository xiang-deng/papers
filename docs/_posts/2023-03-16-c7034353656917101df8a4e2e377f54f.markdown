Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is a powerful way to express Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which can help machines learn patterns hidden in the KGs. Relation patterns are useful hidden patterns, and they usually assist machines to predict unseen facts. Many existing KGE approaches can model some common relation patterns like symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and commutative composition patterns. However, most of them are weak in modeling noncommutative composition Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
