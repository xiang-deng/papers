X-risk is a term introduced to represent a family of compositional measures or objectives, in which each data point is compared with a set of data points explicitly or implicitly for defining a risk function. It includes many widely used measures or objectives, eg, AUROC, AUPRC, partial AUROC, NDCG, MAP, top-$ K $ NDCG, top-$ K $ MAP, listwise losses, p-norm push, top push, precision/recall at top $ K $ positions, precision at a certain recall level, contrastive objectives, etc. While these
