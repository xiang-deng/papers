Although, recent advances in neural network models for coreference resolution have led to substantial improvements on benchmark datasets, it remains a challenge to successfully transfer those models to new target domains containing many out-of-vocabulary spans and requiring differing annotation schemes. Typical approaches for domain adaptation involve continued training on coreference annotations in the target domain, but obtaining those annotations is costly and time-consuming. In this …
