Tables are omnipresent on the web and in various vertical domains, storing massive amounts of valuable data. However, the great flexibility in the table layout hinders the machine from understanding this valuable data. In order to unlock and utilize knowledge from tables, extracting data as numerical tuples is the first and critical step. As a form of relational data, numerical tuples have direct and transparent relationships between their elements and are therefore easy for machines to use Cites: TURL: Table Understanding through Representation Learning
