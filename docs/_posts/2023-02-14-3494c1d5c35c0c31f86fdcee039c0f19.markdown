The current research demonstrates the application of artificial neural network (ANN) in predicting the fracture under mixed-mode I/II loadings. To this end, based on the analysis of the relative importance of different input factors, the crack parameters of modes I and II, stress intensity factors (KI and K II), T-stress, mode I fracture toughness (K Ic), and ultimate tensile strength ( u) are selected and used as input data to the ANN model. Subsequently, a large number of empirical data are used Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
