The contextual bandit problem is a theoretically justified framework with wide applications in various fields. While the previous study on this problem usually requires independence between noise and contexts, our work considers a more sensible setting where the noise becomes a latent confounder that affects both contexts and rewards. Such a confounded setting is more realistic and could expand to a broader range of applications. However, the unresolved confounder will cause a Cites: Provably optimal algorithms for generalized linear contextual bandits
