The performance of distributed applications implemented using microservice architecture depends heavily on the configuration of various parameters, which are hard to tune due to large configuration search space and inter-dependence of parameters. While the information in product manuals and technical documents guides the tuning process, manual collection of meta-data for all application parameters is laborious and not scalable.
