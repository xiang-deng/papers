Abstract Machine translation between many languages at once is highly challenging, since training with ground truth requires supervision between all language pairs, which is difficult to obtain. Our key insight is that, while languages may vary drastically, the underlying visual appearance of the world remains consistent. We introduce a method that uses visual observations to bridge the gap between languages, rather than relying on parallel corpora or topological properties of the …
