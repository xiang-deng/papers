Hybrid memory systems are able to achieve both high performance and large capacity when combining fast commodity DDR memories with larger but slower non-volatile memories in a heterogeneous way. However, it is critical to best utilize the limited fast memory capacity and slow memory bandwidth in such systems to gain the maximum efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid memory design, Baryon, that leverages both memory compression and data sub-blocking techniques  Cites: Challenges and opportunities with Big Data 2011-1
