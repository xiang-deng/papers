There are a large number of status reports involved in the event trend analysis of nuclear power plants. Relying only on manual coding is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but also presents high requirements on staff experience. By independently constructing a set of classification and coding system suitable for nuclear power plant status reports, this paper uses Naive Bayes classifier (NBC), k-nearest neighbor classifier (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer …
