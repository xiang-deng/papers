Overparameterized models fail to generalize well in the presence of data imbalance even when combined with traditional techniques for mitigating imbalances. This paper focuses on imbalanced classification datasets, in which a small subset of the population--a minority--may contain features that correlate spuriously with the class label. For a parametric family of cross-entropy loss modifications and a representative Gaussian mixture model, we derive non-asymptotic generalization  Cites: An investigation of why overparameterization exacerbates
