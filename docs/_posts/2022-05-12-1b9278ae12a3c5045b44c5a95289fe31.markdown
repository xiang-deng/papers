Abstract To address the Knowledge Graph (KG) heterogeneity issue, we need to determine a set of entity correspondences, which requires aggregating several complementary similarity measures to improve the confidence of the results. How to determine the suitable aggregating weights for the similarity measures to improve the KG alignment s quality is called the KG meta-matching problem, whose challenge of scalability remains significant in the Semantic Web (SW) domain.
