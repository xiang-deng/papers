Investigating public attitudes on social media is important in opinion mining systems. Stance detection aims to analyze the attitude of an opinionated text (eg, favor, neutral or against) toward a given target. Existing methods mainly address this problem from the perspective of fine-tuning. Recently, prompt-tuning has achieved success in natural language processing tasks. However, conducting prompt-tuning methods for stance detection in real-world remains a challenge for several reasons.(1) The text …
