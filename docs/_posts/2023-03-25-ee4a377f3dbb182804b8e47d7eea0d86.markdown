Complete and high-quality deformation monitoring data are critical for shield tunnel construction safety and quality. In engineering practices, data missing frequently occurs during instrumentation, adversely impacting further analysis and decision making. Existing imputation methods either ignore the crucial interactions between different parameters during shield tunneling or focus on the global characteristics of deformation data while neglect their local difference. This paper proposes a novel …
