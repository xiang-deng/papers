Previous work has developed quantitative approaches to characterize the progression of science in different fields, but how individual scientists make progress through their careers is not well understood at a comprehensive scale. We characterize the regularity in the temporal dynamics of scientists publishing behavior with computational algorithms that predict the Cites: Explaining relationships between scientific documents
