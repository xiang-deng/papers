When data-driven algorithms, especially the ones based on deep neural networks (DNNs), replace classical ones, their superior performance often comes with difficulty in their analysis. On the way to compensate for this drawback, formal verification techniques, which can provide reliable guarantees on program behavior, were developed for DNNs. These techniques, however, usually consider DNNs alone, excluding real-world environments in which they operate, and the applicability of Cites: Certified defenses against adversarial examples
