This paper presents machine-learning methods to address various problems in Greek philology. After training a BERT model on the largest premodern Greek dataset used for this purpose to date, we identify and correct previously undetected errors made by scribes in the process of textual transmission, in what is, to our knowledge, the first successful identification of such errors via machine learning. Additionally, we demonstrate the model s capacity to fill gaps caused by material …
