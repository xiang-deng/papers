Based on the natural truth that similar questions correspond to similar SQL queries, a CBR-based approach is proposed to deal with the Text-to-SQL task in this paper. We follow the traditional CBR processes: similarity assessment, case retrieval, and case reuse. First, we introduce a neural classifier in the similarity assessment stage and comprehensively uses classification probability and literal cosine similarity to measure similarity. Then, based on the results of the similarity assessment, our Cites: SParC: Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing in Context
