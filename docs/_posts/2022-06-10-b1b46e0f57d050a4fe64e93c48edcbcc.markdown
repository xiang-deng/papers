In this paper, we propose Hypergraph-Induced Semantic Tuplet (HIST) loss for deep metric learning that leverages the multilateral semantic relations of multiple samples to multiple classes via hypergraph modeling. We formulate deep metric learning as a hypergraph node classification problem in which each sample in a mini-batch is regarded as a node and each hyperedge models class-specific semantic relations represented by a semantic tuplet. Unlike previous graph-based losses that only use  Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
