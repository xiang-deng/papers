We apply machine learning to seven learner corpora in English and Spanish with 39 language pairs, showing that statistical models combined with simple n-grams of part-of-speech tags and syntactic dependency relations achieve … Cites: ‪Algorithm selection and model adaptation for ESL correction tasks‬
