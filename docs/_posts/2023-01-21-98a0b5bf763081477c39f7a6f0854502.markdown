Code generation is a key technique for model-driven engineering (MDE) approaches of software construction. Code generation enables the synthesis of applications in executable programming languages from high-level specifications in UML or in a domain-specific language. Specialised code generation languages and tools have been defined; however, the task of manually constructing a code generator remains a substantial undertaking, requiring a high degree of expertise in both the source Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
