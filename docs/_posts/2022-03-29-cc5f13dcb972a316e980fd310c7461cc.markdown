Machine learning (ML) model is increasingly used to predict short-term outcome in critically ill patients, but the study for long-term outcome is sparse. We used explainable ML approach to establish 30-day, 90-day and 1-year mortality prediction model in critically ill ventilated patients. We retrospectively included patients who were admitted to intensive care units during 20152018 at a tertiary hospital in central Taiwan and linked with the Taiwanese nationwide death registration data Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
