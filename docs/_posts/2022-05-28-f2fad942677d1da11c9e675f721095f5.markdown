Subject to the semantic gap lying between natural and formal language, neural semantic parsing is typically bottlenecked by the paucity and imbalance of data. In this paper, we propose a unified intermediate representation (IR) for graph query languages, namely GraphQ IR. With the IR s natural-language-like representation that bridges the semantic gap and its formally defined syntax that maintains the graph structure, neural semantic parser can more effectively convert user queries Cites: A syntactic neural model for general-purpose code generation
