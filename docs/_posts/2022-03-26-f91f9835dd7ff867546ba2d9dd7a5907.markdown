Pre-training has been adopted in a few of recent works for Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). However, previous pre-training methods for VLN either lack the ability to predict future actions or ignore the trajectory contexts, which are essential for a greedy navigation process. In this work, to promote the learning of spatio- temporal visual-textual correspondence as well as the agent s capability of decision making, we propose a novel history-and-order aware pre-training paradigm (HOP) Cites: Oscar: Object-semantics aligned pre-training for vision-language
