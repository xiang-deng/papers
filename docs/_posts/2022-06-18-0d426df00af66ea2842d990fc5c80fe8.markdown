Background and objective: Preoperative imaging diagnosis of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis is particularly important for breast cancer patients. This paper focuses on developing non-invasive and automatic schemes for accurate localization and classification (metastasis prediction) of ALN via contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) image and deep learning models. Methods: Based on a two-stage strategy, a novel detection neural network is proposed, where the …
