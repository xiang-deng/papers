Accurate Noctiluca scintillans bloom (NSB) recognition from space is of great significance for marine ecological monitoring and underwater target detection. However, most existing NSB recognition models require expert visual interpretation or manual adjustment of model thresholds, which limits model application in operational NSB monitoring. To address these problems, we developed a Noctiluca scintillans Bloom Recognition Network (NSBRNet) incorporating an Inception Conv …
