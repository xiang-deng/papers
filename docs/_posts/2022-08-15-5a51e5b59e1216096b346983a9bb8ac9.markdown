The increase in car ownership has brought convenience to people s lives, but it has also led to a sharp increase in pedestrianvehicle conflicts. Such conflicts can be avoided by braking when pedestrians in front of the car are detected. However, frequent braking reduces driving comfort and travel efficiency. Considering that pedestrianvehicle conflicts always occur when pedestrians cross the road, this study proposes a multifactor fusion network (MFFN) to anticipate pedestrians Cites: Espnet: Efficient spatial pyramid of dilated convolutions for
