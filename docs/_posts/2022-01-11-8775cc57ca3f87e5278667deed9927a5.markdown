In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained popularity in many engineering applications especially for computer vision. In order to achieve better performance, more complex structures and advanced operations are incorporated into neural networks, which results in very long inference time. But real-time perception systems are necessary for autonomous vehicles. In this dissertation, it investigates four major tasks in an autonomous driving perception system, including Cites: ESPNetv2: A Light-weight, Power Efficient, and General Purpose
