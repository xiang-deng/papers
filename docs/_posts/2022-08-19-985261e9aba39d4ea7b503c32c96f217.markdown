Spreadsheets are widely used for table manipulation and presentation. Stylistic formatting of these tables is an important property for both presentation and analysis. As a result, popular spreadsheet software, such as Excel, supports automatically formatting tables based on data-dependent rules. Unfortunately, writing these formatting rules can be challenging for users as that requires knowledge of the underlying rule language and data logic. In this paper, we present CORNET, a neuro Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
