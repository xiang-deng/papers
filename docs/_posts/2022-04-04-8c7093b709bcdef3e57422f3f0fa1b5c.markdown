Numerous analyses of reading time (RT) data have been implemented--all in an effort to better understand the cognitive processes driving reading comprehension. However, data measured on words at the end of a sentence--or even at the end of a clause--is often omitted due to the confounding factors introduced by so-called  wrap- up effects,  which manifests as a skewed distribution of RTs for these words. Consequently, the understanding of the cognitive processes that might be involved in Cites: Syntactic and semantic factors in processing difficulty: An
