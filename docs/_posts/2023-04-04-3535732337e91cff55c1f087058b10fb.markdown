Document-level relation extraction is an essential task in natural language understanding and requires the ability to fully learn different representations of entities and multi-hop reasoning across multiple sentences. Most existing methods use graph neural networks to extract multi-hop relations. They only focus on the role of edge types and ignore node types when obtaining node representations. In addition, it is difficult for them to adequately capture the complex interactions in a Cites: Cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction with graph lstms
