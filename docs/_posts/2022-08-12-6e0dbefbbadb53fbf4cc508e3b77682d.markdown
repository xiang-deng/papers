Recent neural generation systems have demonstrated the potential for procedurally generating game content, images, stories, and more. However, most neural generation algorithms are uncontrolled in the sense that the user has little say in creative decisions beyond the initial prompt specification. Co-creative, mixed-initiative systems require user-centric means of influencing the algorithm, especially when users are unlikely to have machine learning expertise.
