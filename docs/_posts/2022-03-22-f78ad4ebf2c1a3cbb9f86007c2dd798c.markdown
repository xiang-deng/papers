Deep learning algorithms and particularly convolutional neural networks are very successful in pattern recognition from images and are increasingly employed in biology. The development of automated systems for rapid and reliable species identification is vital for insect systematics and may revolutionize this field soon. In this study, we demonstrate the ability of a convolutional neural network to identify species based on habitus photographs with expertlevel accuracy in a taxonomically Cites:   Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
