The main purpose of relation extraction is to extract the semantic relationships between tagged pairs of entities in a sentence, which plays an important role in the semantic understanding of sentences and the construction of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose that the key semantic information within a sentence plays a key role in the relationship extraction of entities. We propose the hypothesis that the key semantic information inside the sentence plays a key role in entity relationship …
