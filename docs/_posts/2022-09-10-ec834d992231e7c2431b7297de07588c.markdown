The empirical risk minimization approach to data-driven decision making assumes that we can learn a decision rule from training data drawn under the same conditions as the ones we want to deploy it under. However, in a number of settings, we may be concerned that our training sample is biased, and that some groups (characterized by either observable or unobservable attributes) may be under-or over-represented relative to the general population; and in this setting empirical risk minimization over  Cites: Distributionally Robust Models with Parametric Likelihood Ratios
