In light of deep neural network applications emerging in diverse fieldseg, industry, healthcare or financeweaknesses and failures of these models might bare unacceptable risks. Methods are needed that enable developers to discover and mitigate such weaknesses in order to develop trustworthy Machine Learning (ML), especially in safetycritical application areas. However, it is necessary to get an insight into the rapidly developing variety of methods for correcting different Cites: Verified uncertainty calibration
