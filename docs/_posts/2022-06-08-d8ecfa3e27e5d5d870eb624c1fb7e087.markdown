Bioactive peptides are typically small functional peptides with 2–20 amino acid residues and play versatile roles in metabolic and biological processes. Bioactive peptides are multi-functional, so it is vastly challenging to accurately detect all their functions simultaneously. We proposed a convolution neural network (CNN) and bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM)-based deep learning method (called MPMABP) for recognizing multi-activities of bioactive peptides. The MPMABP …
