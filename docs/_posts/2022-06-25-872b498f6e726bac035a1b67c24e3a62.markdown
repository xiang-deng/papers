With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, semantic recognition technology is becoming more and more mature, providing the preconditions for the development of natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology. In the latest research on NL2SQL, the use of pre-trained models as feature extractors for natural language and table schema has led to a very significant improvement in the effectiveness of the models. However, the current models do not take into account the degradation of  Cites: TypeSQL: Knowledge-based Type-Aware Neural Text-to-SQL
