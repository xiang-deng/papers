Emergent communication protocols among humans and artificial neural network agents do not yet share the same properties and show some critical mismatches in results. We describe three important phenomena with respect to the emergence and benefits of compositionality: ease-of-learning, generalization, and group size effects (ie, larger groups create more systematic languages). The latter two are not fully replicated with neural agents, which hinders the use of neural emergent Cites: Compositionality and capacity in emergent languages
