Recent advances in robot learning have shown promise in enabling robots to perform a variety of manipulation tasks and generalize to novel scenarios. One of the key contributing factors to this progress is the scale of robot data used to train the models. To obtain large-scale datasets, prior approaches have relied on either demonstrations requiring high human involvement or engineering-heavy autonomous data collection schemes, both of which are challenging to scale.
