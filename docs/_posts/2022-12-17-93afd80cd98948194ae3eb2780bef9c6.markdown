We present our work on augmenting dialogue act recognition capabilities utilizing synthetically generated data. Our work is motivated by the limitations of current dialogue act datasets, and the need to adapt for new domains as well as ambiguity in utterances written by humans. We list our observations and findings towards how synthetically generated data can contribute meaningfully towards more robust dialogue act recognition models extending to new domains. Our major finding shows …
