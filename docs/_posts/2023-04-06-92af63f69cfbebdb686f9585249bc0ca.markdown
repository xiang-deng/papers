Representation multi-task learning (MTL) and transfer learning (TL) have achieved tremendous success in practice. However, the theoretical understanding of these methods is still lacking. Most existing theoretical works focus on cases where all tasks share the same representation, and claim that MTL and TL almost always improve performance. However, as the number of tasks grow, assuming all tasks share the same representation is unrealistic. Also, this does not always match  Cites: Transfer Learning via Representation Learning
