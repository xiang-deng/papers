Human language is an incredibly rich yet incredibly constrained system. Learning and generalizing these systematic constraints from small, sparse, and underspecified data presents a fundamental inference problem. Therapidity and ease by which humans learn these constraints has made this a foundational study in cognitive science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. Traditional approaches treat this problem as grammar induction, positing structured mental representations where Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
