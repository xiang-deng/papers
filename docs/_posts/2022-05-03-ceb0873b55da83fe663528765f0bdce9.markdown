Machine learning (ML) is used in many applications but creating a useful model from data is a knowledge-intensive and laborious task. Automated machine learning (AutoML) aims to automate the construction of machine learning pipelines in a data- driven way, which allows novice users to create ML models and expert users to focus on other tasks. A diverse set of approaches for AutoML have been proposed, however previous work largely compares frameworks or techniques in an ad-hoc Cites: Dynabench: Rethinking benchmarking in NLP
