Multimodal sentiment classification is an important research attracting many scientists  attention in natural language processing. In most multimodal sentiment research, each modal of the dataset is labeled with a unified label. However, this unified label of multimodal data may limit the model to obtain the different information between multimodal in the training process. To address the above issues, this paper proposes AtM-DNN, a model based on multimodal attention fusion network in … Cites: ‪Adaptive recursive neural network for target-dependent twitter …‬
