An enhanced label propagation (LP) method called GraphHop has been proposed recently. It outperforms graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in the semi-supervised node classification task on various networks. Although the performance of GraphHop was explained intuitively with joint node attributes and labels smoothening, its rigorous mathematical treatment is lacking. In this paper, new insights into GraphHop are provided by analyzing it from a constrained optimization viewpoint. We show that Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
