Featured Application Core technology for document-grounded conversation. Abstract Document-grounded conversation (DGC) is a natural language generation task to generate fluent and informative responses by leveraging dialogue history and document (s). Recently, DGCs have focused on fine-tuning using pretrained language models. However, these approaches have a problem in that they must leverage the background knowledge under capacity constraints. For example, the Cites: A knowledge-grounded neural conversation model
