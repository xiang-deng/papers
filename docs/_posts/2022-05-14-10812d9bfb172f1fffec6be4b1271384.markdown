It is common to encounter large-scale monotone inclusion problems where the objective has a finite sum structure. We develop a general framework for variance- reduced forwardbackward splitting algorithms for this problem. This framework includes a number of existing deterministic and variance-reduced algorithms for function minimization as special cases, and it is also applicable to more general problems such as saddle-point problems and variational inequalities.
