ABSTRACT A human-like user simulator that anticipates users satisfaction scores, actions, and utterances can help goal-oriented dialogue systems in evaluating the conversation and refining their dialogue strategies. However, little work has experimented with user simulators which can generate users utterances. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based user simulator that predicts users satisfaction scores and actions while also jointly generating users utterances in a Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
