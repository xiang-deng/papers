Many recent studies of Entity Alignment (EA) use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to aggregate the neighborhood features of entities and achieve better performance. However, aligned entities in real Knowledge Graphs (KGs) usually have non-isomorphic neighborhood structures due to the different data sources of KGs. Therefore, it is insufficient to simply compare the global direct neighborhood of aligned entities, which may also become a variable for the EA judgment.
