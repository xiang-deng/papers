We propose Okapi, a simple, efficient, and general method for robust semi-supervised learning based on online statistical matching. Our method uses a nearest-neighbours-based matching procedure to generate cross-domain views for a consistency loss, while eliminating statistical outliers. In order to perform the online matching in a runtime-and memory-efficient way, we draw upon the self-supervised literature and combine a memory bank with a slow-moving momentum encoder.
