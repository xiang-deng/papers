Diverse microscopic ionic dynamics help mediate the ability of a biological neural network to handle complex tasks with low energy consumption. Thus, rich internal ionic dynamics in transition metal oxide‐based memristors are expected to provide a unique and useful platform for implementing energy‐efficient neuromorphic computing. To this end, a TiOx‐based interface‐type dynamic memristor and an NbOx‐based Mott memristor are integrated as an artificial dendrite and spike‐firing …
