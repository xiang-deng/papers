Diverse microscopic ionic dynamics help mediate the ability of a biological neural network to handle complex tasks with low energy consumption. Thus, rich internal ionic dynamics in transition metal oxidebased memristors are expected to provide a unique and useful platform for implementing energyefficient neuromorphic computing. To this end, a TiOxbased interfacetype dynamic memristor and an NbOxbased Mott memristor are integrated as an artificial dendrite and spikefiring Cites: Carbon emissions and large neural network training
