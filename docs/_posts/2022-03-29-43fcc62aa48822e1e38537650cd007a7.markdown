We present minicons, an open source library that provides a standard API for researchers interested in conducting behavioral and representational analyses of transformer-based language models (LMs). Specifically, minicons enables researchers to apply analysis methods at two levels:(1) at the prediction level--by providing functions to efficiently extract word/sentence level probabilities; and (2) at the representational level--by also facilitating efficient extraction of word/phrase level Cites: Abductive commonsense reasoning
