This work is intended as a voice in the discussion over the recent claims that LaMDA, a pretrained language model based on the Transformer model architecture, is sentient. This claim, if confirmed, would have serious ramifications in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community due to wide-spread use of similar models. However, here we take the position that such a language model cannot be sentient, or conscious, and that LaMDA in particular exhibits no advances over other similar  Cites: Emergent abilities of large language models
