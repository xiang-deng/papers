Deductive reasoning (drawing conclusions from assumptions) is a challenging problem in NLP. In this work, we focus on proof generation: given a hypothesis and a set of supporting facts in natural language, the model generates a proof tree indicating how to deduce the hypothesis from supporting facts. Instead of generating the entire proof in one shot, prior work has demonstrated the promise of stepwise generation but achieved limited success on real-world data.
