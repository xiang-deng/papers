Recent years witnessed a number of proposals for the use of the so-called interpretable models in specific application domains. These include high-risk, but also safety-critical domains. In contrast, other works reported some pitfalls of machine learning model interpretability, in part justified by the lack of a rigorous definition of what an interpretable model should represent. This study proposes to relate interpretability with the ability of a model to offer explanations of why a …
