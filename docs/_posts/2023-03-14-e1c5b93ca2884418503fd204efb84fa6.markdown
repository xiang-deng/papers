Abstract Knowledge-enhanced language models in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have demonstrated in recent years that they are effective in many applications. This work attempts to show that knowledge-enhanced language models can be used to produce outputs that are not only more consistent with the information that is already known, but are also more plausible given other known information. In order to do so, this work introduces a modified Bidirectional and AutoRegressive …
