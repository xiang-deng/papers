Temporal information extraction (TIE) has attracted a great deal of interest over the last two decades, leading to the development of a significant number of datasets. Despite its benefits, having access to a large volume of corpora makes it difficult when it comes to benchmark TIE systems. On the one hand, different datasets have different annotation schemes, thus hindering the comparison between competitors across different corpora. On the other hand, the fact that each corpus is commonly  Cites: TORQUE: A reading comprehension dataset of temporal ordering
