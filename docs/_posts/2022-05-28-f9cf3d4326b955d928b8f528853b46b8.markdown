Traditional machine translation (MT) metrics provide an average measure of translation quality that is insensitive to the long tail of behavioral problems in MT. Examples include translation of numbers, physical units, dropped content and hallucinations. These errors, which occur rarely and unpredictably in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), greatly undermine the reliability of state-of-the-art MT systems. Consequently, it is important to have visibility into these problems during model  Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
