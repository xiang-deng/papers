Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is an important topic in the computer vision community. The key difficulty lies in defining a common property between the source and target domains so that the source-domain features can align with the target- domain semantics. In this paper, we present a simple and effective mechanism that regularizes cross-domain representation learning with a domain-agnostic prior (DAP) that constrains the features extracted from source and target domains to align Cites: Oscar: Object-semantics aligned pre-training for vision-language
