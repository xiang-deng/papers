Recent advances in deep learning have greatly propelled the research on semantic parsing. Improvement has since been made in many downstream tasks, including natural language interface to web APIs, text-to-SQL generation, among others. However, despite the close connection shared with these tasks, research on question answering over knowledge bases (KBQA) has comparatively been progressing slowly. We identify and attribute this to two unique challenges of KBQA  Cites: Model-based interactive semantic parsing: A unified framework
