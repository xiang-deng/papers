Crowd counting has attracted increasing attentions in recent years due to its challenges and wide societal applications. Despite persevering efforts made by the research community, most of existing methods require a large amount of location-level annotations. Collecting such type of fine-granularity supervisory signals is extremely time-consuming and labour-intensive, thereby hindering the well generalization of these location-adherent models. To shun this drawback, several  Cites: Coatnet: Marrying convolution and attention for all data sizes
