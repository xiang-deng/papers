Abstract Federated Continual Learning (FCL) approaches exist two major problems of the probability bias and the imbalance in parameter variations. These two problems lead to catastrophic forgetting of the network in the FCL process. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel FCL framework, Federated Probability Memory Recall (FedPMR), to mitigate the probability bias problem and the imbalance in parameter variations. Firstly, for the probability bias problem, this paper designs the Probability  Cites: Learn to grow: A continual structure learning framework for
