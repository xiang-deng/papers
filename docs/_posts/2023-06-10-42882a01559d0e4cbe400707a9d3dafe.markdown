This thesis addresses the intersection of neural and symbolic artificial intelligence systems. Recent deep learning methods could memorize vast amount of world knowledge, but still have their limitation to conduct symbolic reasoning over them; while symbolic AI is good at solving reasoning tasks, but is inefficient for adapting to new knowledge. Prior efforts that bridge the two worlds mainly focus on building parsing-based systems, which require lots of annotated intermediate labels and hard …
