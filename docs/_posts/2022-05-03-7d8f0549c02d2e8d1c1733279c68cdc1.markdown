Machine learning models often fail to generalize to unseen domains due to the distributional shifts. A family of such shifts,correlation shifts, is caused by spurious correlations in the data. It is studied under the overarching topic of domain generalization. In this work, we employ multi-modal translation networks to tackle the correlation shifts that appear when data is sampled out-of-distribution. Learning a generative model from training domains enables us to translate each training sample Cites: Wilds: A benchmark of in-the-wild distribution shifts
