Finger-vein has been used for automatic personal recognition systems for over a decade. Its size and characteristics against presentation attacks make it suitable for various commercial and governmental applications. As with other biometric traits, the majority of finger-vein recognition methods employ hand-crafted feature for image classification. Lately, there are some convolutional neural network (CNN) models are designed for finger-vein identification and verification. Whereas, the CNN-based …
