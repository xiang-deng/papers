Depression is a common but easily misdiagnosed disease when using a self-assessment scale. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) provide an important reference and objective basis for the identification and diagnosis of depression. In order to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of depression by using mainstream algorithms, a high-performance hybrid neural network depression detection method is proposed in this paper combined with deep learning technology. Firstly, a …
