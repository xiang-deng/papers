Short text classification has been a fundamental task in natural language processing, which benefits various applications, such as sentiment analysis, news tagging, and intent recommendation. However, classifying short texts is challenging due to the information sparsity in the text corpus. Besides, the performance of existing machine learning classification models largely relies on sufficient training data, yet labels can be scarce and expensive to obtain in realworld text classification scenarios.
