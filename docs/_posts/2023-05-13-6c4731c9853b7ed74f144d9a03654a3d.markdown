Human intelligence gradually accepts new information and accumulates knowledge throughout the lifespan. However, deep learning models suffer from a catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, where they forget previous knowledge when acquiring new information. Class-Incremental Learning aims to create an integrated model that balances plasticity and stability to overcome this challenge. In this paper, we propose a selective regularization method that accepts new knowledge while maintaining Cites: Robust fine-tuning of zero-shot models
