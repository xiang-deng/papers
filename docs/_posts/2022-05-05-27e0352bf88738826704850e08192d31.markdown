Prediction results from complex machine learning models can be challenging to interpret. Understanding these models is essential when trusting results in decision- making. In this master thesis, we will utilize Shapley values to explain individual predictions from a complex machine learning algorithm. Our aim is to explain why prediction models obtain their results, so people can interpret them better. The chosen case is based on a thesis called Predicting Financial Distress in Norway by Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
