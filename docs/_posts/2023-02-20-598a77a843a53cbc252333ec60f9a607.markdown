Abstract The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network has great potential in estimating and predicting a variable. In addition to radar reflectivity (Z), radar echo-top height (ET) is also a good indicator of rainfall rate (R). In this study, we propose a new method, GRU_Z-ET, by introducing Z and ET as two independent variables into the GRU neural network to conduct the quantitative single-polarization radar precipitation estimation. The performance of GRU_Z-ET is compared with that of the Cites: A neural network approach to jointly modeling social networks and
