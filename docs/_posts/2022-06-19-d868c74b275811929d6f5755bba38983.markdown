(Source) Code summarization aims to automatically generate summaries/comments for a given code snippet in the form of natural language. Such summaries play a key role in helping developers understand and maintain source code. Existing code summarization techniques can be categorized into extractive methods and abstractive methods. The extractive methods extract a subset of important statements and keywords from the code snippet using retrieval techniques, and generate a  Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
