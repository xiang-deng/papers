In modern industries, data-driven fault detection and classification (FDC) systems can efficiently maintain industrial security and stability, while the security of the data-driven FDC system itself is rarely or even never considered. The security problem named adversarial vulnerability is the intrinsic of data-driven machine learning models, which will give incorrect predictions under the maliciously perturbed input data. This paper presents a work on this new security topic of the data-driven FDC Cites: Adversarial NLI: A New Benchmark for Natural Language
