Datasets with significant proportions of bias present threats for training a trustworthy model on NLU tasks. Despite yielding great progress, current debiasing methods impose excessive reliance on the knowledge of bias attributes. Definition of the attributes, however, is elusive and varies across different datasets. Furthermore, leveraging these attributes at input level to bias mitigation may leave a gap between intrinsic properties and the underlying decision rule.
