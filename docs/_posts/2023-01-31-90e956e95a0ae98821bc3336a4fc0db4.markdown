Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful machine learning technique relying on the structural risk minimization principle. The applications of SVM in structural reliability analysis (SRA) are enormous in the recent past. There are review articles on machine learning-based methods that partly discussed the development of SVM for SRA applications along with other machine learning methods. However, there is no dedicated review on SVM for SRA applications. Thus, a review article on the  Cites: Leave-one-out bounds for support vector regression model selection
