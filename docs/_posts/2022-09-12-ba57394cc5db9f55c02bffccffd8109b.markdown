Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are intended to help human users better understand the decision making of an AI agent. However, many modern XAI approaches are unintuitive to end users, particularly those without prior AI or ML knowledge. In this paper, we present a novel XAI approach we call Responsibility that identifies the most responsible training example for a particular decision. This example can then be shown as an explanation: this is what I (the AI) learned that led Cites: No explainability without accountability: An empirical study of
