Stock price prediction is an important and challenging research topic, which has wide application prospects. Correct forecasting results can provide valuable guidance to investors and thus reduce the investment risk. To improve the prediction accuracy and obtain better prediction results, a new stock price prediction model called VML is proposed in this paper. First, the VML model slices the stock price series to obtain multiple window series, then uses variational mode decomposition Cites: Meta-Learning for Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation
