Cloud computing has become a new platform for personal computing. Cloud computing provides high performance computing resources and mass storage resources. Cloud providers use the distributed cloud computing for the better cloud services. This means that we can minimize the data scheduling between the data centers. The use of genetic algorithms to address the data placement problems in cloud computing. The experimental results show that genetic algorithm can  Cites: Challenges and opportunities with Big Data 2011-1
