There has been a growing interest in the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Despite the promise that such approaches hold, there are various aspects where they could be improved. Two such shortcomings are (i) their computational inefficiency relative to classical numerical methods, and (ii) the non-interpretability of a trained DNN model. In this work we present ASPINN, an anisotropic extension of our earlier work called SPINN--Sparse  Cites: " Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any
