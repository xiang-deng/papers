Dense retrieval models using a transformer-based bi-encoder design have emerged as an active area of research. In this work, we focus on the task of monolingual retrieval in a variety of typologically diverse languages using one such design. Although recent work with multilingual transformers demonstrates that they exhibit strong cross-lingual generalization capabilities, there remain many open research questions, which we tackle here. Our study is organized as a  best practices  guide Cites: One question answering model for many languages with cross
