The abundant availability of data in Big Data era has helped achieving significant advances in the machine learning field. However, many datasets appear with incompleteness from different perspectives such as values, labels, annotations and records. By discarding the records yielding ambiguousness, the exploitable data settles down to a small, sometimes ineffective, portion. Making the most of this small portion is burdensome because it usually yields overfitted models. In this paper we Cites: Learning with Local and Global Consistency.
