In recent years, deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely used in code vulnerability detection. The DL-based methods typically extract structural information from source code, eg, code structure graph, and adopt neural networks such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn the graph representations. However, these methods do not consider the heterogeneous relations in the code structure graph, ie, different types of nodes and edges, which may obstruct the graph representation …
