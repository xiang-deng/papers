Card et al. s classic paper The Design Space of Input Devices established the value of design spaces as a tool for HCI analysis and invention. We posit that developing design spaces for emerging pre-trained, general AI models is necessary for supporting their integration into human-centered systems and practices. We explore what it means to develop an AI model design space by proposing two design spaces relating to pre-trained AI models: the first considers how HCI can impact pre-trained Cites: AI Chains: Transparent and Controllable Human-AI Interaction by
