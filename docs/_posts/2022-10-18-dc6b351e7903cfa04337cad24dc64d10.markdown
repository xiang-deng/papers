Tool SPECS implements an efficient automated approach for reasoning about the SPARQL query containment problem. In this paper, we prove the correctness of this approach. We give precise semantics of the core subset of SPARQL language. We briefly discuss the procedure used for reducing the query containment problem into a formal logical framework. We prove that such reduction is both sound and complete for conjunctive queries, and also for some important cases of non-conjunctive  Cites: Verifying integrity constraints on web sites
