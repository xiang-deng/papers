Centering theory (CT; Grosz et al., 1995) provides a linguistic analysis of the structure of discourse. According to the theory, local coherence of discourse arises from the manner and extent to which successive utterances make reference to the same entities. In this paper, we investigate the connection between centering theory and modern coreference resolution systems. We provide an operationalization of centering and systematically investigate if neural coreference resolvers adhere to the …
