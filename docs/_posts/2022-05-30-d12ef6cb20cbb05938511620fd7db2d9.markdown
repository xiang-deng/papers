Multi-view spectral clustering aims to improve the performance of spectral clustering through multi-view data. Many multi-view spectral clustering methods have been proposed recently and achieved promising performance. Among these methods, most of them are designed to pursue numerical consistency in multi-view similarity matrices. However, each similarity matrix has its unique statistic distribution, which makes it not appropriate to seek numerical consistency in multi-view similarity Cites: Spectral clustering and transductive learning with multiple views
