Anomaly detection plays a significant role in preventing from detrimental effects of abnormalities. It brings many benefits in real-world sectors ranging from transportation, finance to cybersecurity. In reality, millions of data do not stand independently, but they might be connected to each other and form graph or network data. A more advanced technique, named graph anomaly detection, is required to model that data type. The current works of graph anomaly detection have achieved …
