Knowledge Graphs (KGs), a structural way to model human knowledge, have been a critical component of many artificial intelligence applications. Many KG-based tasks are built using knowledge representation learning, which embeds KG entities and relations into a low-dimensional semantic space. However, the quality of representation learning is often limited by the heterogeneity and sparsity of real-world KGs. Multi-KG representation learning, which utilizes KGs from different  Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
