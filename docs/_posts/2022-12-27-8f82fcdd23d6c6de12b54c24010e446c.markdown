Computing-in-memory (CIM) is emerging as a promising architecture to accelerate graph convolutional networks (GCNs) normally bounded by redundant and irregular memory transactions. Current analog based CIM requires frequent analog and digital conversions (AD/DA) that dominate the overall area and power consumption. Furthermore, the analog non-ideality degrades the accuracy and reliability of CIM. In this work, an SRAM based digital CIM system is proposed to accelerate memory …
