The generalizability of Deep Learning (DL) models is a significant challenge, as poor generalizability indicates that the model has overfitted to the training data and is not able to generalize to new data. Despite numerous DL-based clone detectors emerging in recent years, their generalizability has not been thoroughly assessed. This study investigates the generalizability of three DL-based clone detectors (CCLearner, ASTNN, and CodeBERT) by comparing their detection accuracy on Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
