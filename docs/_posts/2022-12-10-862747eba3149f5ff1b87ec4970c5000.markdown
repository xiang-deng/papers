An essential component of smart grid applications is the ability to solve the power flow (PF) problem in real-time. As numerical methods are too slow, the use of neural networks (NNs) is rapidly increasing. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their variants have become one of the leading methods to learn graph representations. Power systems and in particular, distribution systems can be represented as graphs, and are characterized by often topology changes, which makes the consideration of Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
