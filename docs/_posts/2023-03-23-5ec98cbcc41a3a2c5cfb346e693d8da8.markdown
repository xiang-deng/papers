Background This study employed a comprehensive approach by investigating the geographical origin classification of green coffee beans at different scales: from the continental to country, and regional levels. An innovative approach combined the stable isotope and trace element analyses with nonlinear machine learning data analysis for improving coffee origin classification and marker selection. Specialty green coffee beans sourced from three continents, eight countries, and 22 regions  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
