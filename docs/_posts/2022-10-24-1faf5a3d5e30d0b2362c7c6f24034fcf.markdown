My doctoral research focuses on understanding semantic knowledge in neural network models trained solely to predict natural language (referred to as language models, or LMs), by drawing on insights from the study of concepts and categories grounded in cognitive science. I propose a framework inspired by  inductive reasoning, a phenomenon that sheds light on how humans utilize background knowledge to make inductive leaps and generalize from new pieces of information …
