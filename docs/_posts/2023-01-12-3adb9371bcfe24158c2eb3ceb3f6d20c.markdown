Data discovery systems help users identify relevant data among large table collections. Users express their discovery needs with a program or a set of keywords. Users may express complex queries using programs but it requires expertise. Keyword search is accessible to a larger audience but limits the types of queries supported. An interesting approach is learned discovery systems which find tables given natural language questions. Unfortunately, these systems require a training  Cites: TaBERT: Pretraining for Joint Understanding of Textual and
