Large language models are now prevalent in the vast majority of research works such as natural language processing, information retrieval, or computer vision. They have demonstrated great abilities in capturing the semantics of elements and generating plausible texts or images. However, their training guided by probabilities and co-occurrence patterns hinders sometimes the relevance of their output. In this manuscript, we aim at discussing and contributing to three main challenges …
