We propose a novel prompting strategy, least-to-most prompting, that enables large language models to better perform multi-step reasoning tasks. Least-to-most prompting first reduces a complex problem into a list of subproblems, and then sequentially solves the subproblems, whereby solving a given subproblem is facilitated by the model s answers to previously solved subproblems.
