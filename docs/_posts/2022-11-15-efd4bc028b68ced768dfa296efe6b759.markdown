Human data labeling with multiple labelers and the resulting conflict resolution remains the norm for many enterprise machine learning pipelines. Conflict resolution can be a time-intensive and costly process.

However, little is known about whether and how people will rely on automation during conflict resolution. Currently, automation commonly  Cites: Does the whole exceed its parts? the effect of ai explanations on
