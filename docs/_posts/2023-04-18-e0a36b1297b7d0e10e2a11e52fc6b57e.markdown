Abstract Knowledge graph completion aims to predict missing relations between entities in a knowledge graph. One of the effective ways for knowledge graph completion is knowledge graph embedding. However, existing embedding methods usually focus on combined models, variant deep neural networks, or additional information, which inevitably increase computational complexity and are unfriendly to real-time applications. In this paper, we take a step back and propose a novel …
