Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP), providing a highly useful, task-agnostic foundation for a wide range of applications. The great promise of LLMs as general task solvers motivated people to extend their functionality largely beyond just a``chatbot , and use it as an assistant or even replacement for domain experts and tools in specific domains such as healthcare, finance, and education.
