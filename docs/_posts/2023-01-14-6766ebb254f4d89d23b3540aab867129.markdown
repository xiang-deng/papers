Ontologies are among the most widely used types of knowledge representation formalisms. The application of deep learning techniques in the field of ontology engineering has reinforced the need to learn and generate representations of ontological data. This allows ontologies to be exploited by such models, and thus automate various ontology engineering tasks, where most of the existing tools and machine learning approaches require a numerical feature vectors associated with Cites: Luke Zettlemoyer. 2018.
