ChatGPT has stimulated the research boom in the field of large language models. In this paper, we assess the capabilities of ChatGPT from four perspectives including Performance, Evaluation Criteria, Robustness and Error Types. Specifically, we first evaluate ChatGPT s performance on 17 datasets with 14 IE sub-tasks under the zero-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought scenarios, and find a huge performance gap between ChatGPT and SOTA results. Next, we rethink this gap and propose a soft Cites: Program Transfer for Answering Complex Questions over
