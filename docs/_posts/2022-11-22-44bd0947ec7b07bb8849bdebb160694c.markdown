Herein, we present an all-inclusive investigation on the effect of plasmonic gold nanoparticles (Au NPCs) embedded Yb-doped TiO 2 nanostructured photoanode for efficient photovoltaics devices. Optimally doped Yb (0.5 mol%)-TiO 2 nanoparticles (NPCs) were synthesised by solid-state grinding. Their structural, morphological, optical, and surface properties were evaluated using XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM-EDX, UPS, and XPS. Results show that Yb-doped TiO 2 NPCs form, reducing Cites: Dye-sensitized solar cells under ambient light powering machine
