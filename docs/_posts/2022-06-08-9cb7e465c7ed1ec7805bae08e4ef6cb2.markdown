Mitosis assessment of breast cancer has a strong prognostic importance and is visually evaluated by pathologists. The inter, and intra-observer variability of this assessment is high. In this paper, a two-stage deep learning approach, named MITNET, has been applied to automatically detect nucleus and classify mitoses in whole slide images (WSI) of breast cancer. Moreover, this paper introduces two new datasets. The first dataset is used to detect the nucleus in the WSIs, which contains …
