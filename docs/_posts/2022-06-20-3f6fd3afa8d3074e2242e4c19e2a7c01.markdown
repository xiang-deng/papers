Abstract Knowledge graph completion (KGC) can be interpreted as the task of missing inferences to real-world facts. Despite the importance and abundance of temporal knowledge graphs, most of the current research has been focused on reasoning on static knowledge graphs. The data they are applied to usually evolves with time, such as friend graphs in social networks. Therefore, developing temporal knowledge graph completion (temporal KGC) models is an increasingly important …
