Text classification, aiming for discovering corresponding relationships between labels and texts, is a pivotal task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The existing joint text-label models help input texts to establish early global category semantic awareness via label embedding techniques, but they cannot simultaneously capture literal and semantic relationships between texts and labels. It may lead models to ignore obvious clues or semantic relations on different cognitive levels. In this paper  Cites: Document modeling with gated recurrent neural network for
