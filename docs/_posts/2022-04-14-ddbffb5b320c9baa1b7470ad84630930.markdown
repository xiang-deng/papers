The development of new search algorithms requires an evaluation framework in which A/B testing of new vs. existing algorithms can be reliably performed. While today s search evaluation methodology is reliable, it relies heavily upon people manually annotating the relevance of many search results, which is slow and expensive. Moreover, this practice has become increasingly infeasible as digital collections have grown ever-larger. Consequently, there is an urgent need today for Cites: ERASER: A benchmark to evaluate rationalized NLP models
