The lack of interpretability often makes black-box models challenging to be applied in many practical domains. For this reason, the current work, from the black-box model input port, proposes to incorporate data-mined knowledge into the black-box soft-margin SVM model to enhance accuracy and interpretability. The concept and incorporation mechanism of data-mined knowledge are successively developed, based on which a partially interpretable soft-margin SVM (pTsm-SVM) optimization  Cites: " Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any
