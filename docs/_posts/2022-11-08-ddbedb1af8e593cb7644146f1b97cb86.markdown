Abstract[Purpose/significance] How to equip AI systems including AI agents with the knowledge and skills and make them behave in a more humanized way is the core proposition of AI governance. AI training, especially humanin-the-loop AI training, is a valuable solution to this problem.[Method/process] Firstly, based on the procedure anal? ysis, the basic process of human-in-the-loop AI training is proposed. Secondly, the interaction models of AI training are proposed based on the human-in-the-loop  Cites: Trick me if you can: Human-in-the-loop generation of adversarial
