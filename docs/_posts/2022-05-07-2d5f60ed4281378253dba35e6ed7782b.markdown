We introduce SparcAssist, a general-purpose risk assessment tool for the machine learning models trained for language tasks. It evaluates models  risk by inspecting their behavior on counterfactuals, namely out-of-distribution instances generated based on the given data instance. The counterfactuals are generated by replacing tokens in rational subsequences identified by ExPred, while the replacements are retrieved using HotFlip or Masked-Language-Model-based algorithms.
