Detecting suicidal tendencies and preventing suicides is an important social goal. The rise and continuance of emotion, the emotion category, and the intensity of the emotion are important clues about suicidal tendencies. The three determinants of emotion, viz. Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) can help determine a person s exact emotion (s) and its intensity. This paper introduces an end-to-end VAD-assisted transformer-based multi-task network for detecting emotion (primary task) Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
