Handing objects to humans is an essential capability for collaborative robots. Previous research works on human-robot handovers focus on facilitating the performance of the human partner and possibly minimising the physical effort needed to grasp the object. However, altruistic robot behaviours may result in protracted and awkward robot motions, contributing to unpleasant sensations by the human partner and affecting perceived safety and social acceptance.
