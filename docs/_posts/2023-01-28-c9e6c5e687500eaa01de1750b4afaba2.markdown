Abstract Knowledge graph embedding models are used to learn lowdimensional representations of entities and relations in knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose MultiRAttE, an attentionbased learning method for multiple relational knowledge graph embedding representation, which divides the information transfer in the knowledge graph into crossrelational information transfer and relationspecific information transfer, and divides the embedding of knowledge graph entities  Cites: Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text
