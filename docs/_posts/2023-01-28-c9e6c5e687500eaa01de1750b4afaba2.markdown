Abstract Knowledge graph embedding models are used to learn low‐dimensional representations of entities and relations in knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose Multi‐RAttE, an attention‐based learning method for multiple relational knowledge graph embedding representation, which divides the information transfer in the knowledge graph into cross‐relational information transfer and relation‐specific information transfer, and divides the embedding of knowledge graph entities …
