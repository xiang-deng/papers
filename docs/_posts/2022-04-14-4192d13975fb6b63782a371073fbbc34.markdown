Aided by big data and over-parameterization, modern deep learning techniques can achieve excellent performance in many learning tasks under benign environments. Therefore, at a rapid pace, deep learning is being deployed to diversified real-world applications, including some privacy or fairness-critical ones [24]. For privacycritical applications, there is a growing concern that deep learning would be a primary source of user privacy leakage in the future, and forestalling privacy leakage from Cites: Controllable Invariance through Adversarial Feature Learning
