The goal of this work is to propose a robust, fast, and fully automatic method for personalized cranial defect reconstruction and implant modeling. We propose a two- step deep learning-based method using a modified U-Net architecture to perform the defect reconstruction, and a dedicated iterative procedure to improve the implant geometry, followed by automatic generation of models ready for 3-D printing. We propose a cross-case augmentation based on imperfect image registration Cites: A framework for contrastive self-supervised learning and designing
