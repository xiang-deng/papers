Automated generation of business process models from natural language text is an emerging methodology for avoiding the manual creation of formal business process models. For this purpose, process entities like actors, activities, objects etc., and relations among them are extracted from textual process descriptions. A high-quality annotated corpus of textual process descriptions (PET) has been published accompanied with a basic process extraction approach. In its current state, however  Cites: End-to-end Neural Coreference Resolution
