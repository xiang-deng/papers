The relationship between spatial information of molecular topology and odor characteristics has received increasing attention from the academic community. Odor intensity (OI) prediction, as one of the most important topics in the olfactory systems (OS), has been thoroughly investigated in the past. Nonetheless, traditional methods have certain limitations as they usually require high-precision instruments and are time-consuming in collecting OI datasets. Here, we created a novel and efficient Cites: Chemical-Reaction-Aware Molecule Representation Learning
