Molecular representation learning (MRL) is a key step to build the connection between machine learning and chemical science. In particular, it encodes molecules as numerical vectors preserving the molecular structures and features, on top of which the downstream tasks (eg, property prediction) can be performed. Recently, MRL has achieved considerable progress, especially in deep molecular graph learning-based methods. In this survey, we systematically review these graph-based …
