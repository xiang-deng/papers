Dialogue state tracking (DST) is an important step in dialogue management to keep track of users  beliefs. Existing works fine-tune all language model (LM) parameters to tackle the DST task, which requires significant data and computing resources for training and hosting. The cost grows exponentially in the real-world deployment where dozens of fine-tuned LM are used for different domains and tasks. To reduce parameter size and better utilize cross-task shared information, we propose to use …
