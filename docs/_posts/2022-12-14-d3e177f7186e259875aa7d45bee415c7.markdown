Current work in named entity recognition (NER) uses either cross entropy (CE) or conditional random fields (CRF) as the objective/loss functions to optimize the underlying NER model. Both of these traditional objective functions for the NER problem generally produce adequate performance when the data distribution is balanced and there are sufficient annotated training examples. But since NER is inherently an imbalanced tagging problem, the model performance under the low …
