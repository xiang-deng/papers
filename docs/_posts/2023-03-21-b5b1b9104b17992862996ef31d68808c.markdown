We describe a series of experiments focused on a number of basic textual features and their effectiveness at the task of automatic stance detection.

Based on our analysis, we find that the words in a tweet offer the most insight into the stance, and that adding features from sentiment lexicons can improve the Cites: NL-Augmenter: A Framework for Task-Sensitive Natural Language
