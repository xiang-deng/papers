Pre-trained language models (LMs) have made significant advances in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) domains, but it is unclear to what extent they can infer formal semantics in ontologies, which are often used to represent conceptual knowledge and serve as the schema of data graphs. To investigate an LM s knowledge of ontologies, we propose OntoLAMA, a set of inference-based probing tasks and datasets from ontology subsumption axioms involving both atomic  Cites: Probing across time: What does RoBERTa know and when?
