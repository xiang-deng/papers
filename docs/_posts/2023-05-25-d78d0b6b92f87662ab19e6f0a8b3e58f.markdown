Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention, but the definition of large lacks clarity. This paper focuses on medium-sized lan-guage models (MLMs), defined as having at least six billion parameters but less than 100 billion. The study evaluates MLMs regarding zero-shot genera-tive question answering, which requires models to provide elaborate answers without external document retrieval. The paper introduces an own test da-taset and presents results from human  Cites: Transcending scaling laws with 0.1% extra compute
