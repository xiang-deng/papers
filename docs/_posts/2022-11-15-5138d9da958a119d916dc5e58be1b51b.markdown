Searching and reusing code snippets from open-source software repositories based on natural-language queries can greatly improve programming productivity. Recently, deep-learning-based approaches have become increasingly popular for code search. Despite substantial progress in training accurate models of code search, the robustness of these models has received little attention so far. In this paper, we aim to study and understand the security and robustness of code search Cites: Dawn Drain, Neel Sundaresan, Jian Yin, Daxin Jiang, and Ming
