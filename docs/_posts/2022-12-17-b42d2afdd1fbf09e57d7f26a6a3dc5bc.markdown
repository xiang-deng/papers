Large pre-trained models have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. CodeBERT is one such pre-trained model for natural language (NL) and programming language (PL) which captures the semantics in natural language and programming language, and produces general-purpose representations. While it has been shown to support natural language code search and code documentation generation tasks, its effectiveness for code clone …
