Context: Code Clone Detection (CCD) is a software engineering task that is used for plagiarism detection, code search, and code comprehension. Recently, deep learning-based models have achieved an F1 score (a metric used to assess classifiers) of $ sim $95 % on the CodeXGLUE benchmark. These models require many training data, mainly fine-tuned on Java or C++ datasets. However, no previous study evaluates the generalizability of these models where a limited amount Cites: Universal natural language processing with limited annotations
