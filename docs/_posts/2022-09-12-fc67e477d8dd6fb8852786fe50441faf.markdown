Incorporating tagging into neural machine translation (NMT) systems has shown promising results in helping translate rare words such as named entities (NE). However, translating NE in low-resource setting remains a challenge. In this work, we investigate the effect of using tags and NE hypernyms from knowledge graphs (KGs) in parallel corpus in different levels of resource conditions. We find the tag-and-copy mechanism (tag the NEs in the source sentence and copy them to the target  Cites: Efficient One-Pass End-to-End Entity Linking for Questions
