Despite years of research on transport protocols, the tussle between in-network and end-to-end congestion control has not been solved. This debate is due to the variance of conditions and assumptions in different network scenarios, eg, cellular versus data center networks. Recently, the community has proposed a few transport protocols driven by machine learning, nonetheless limited to end-to-end approaches. In this paper, we present Owl, a transport protocol based on reinforcement learning  Cites: On the generalization gap in reparameterizable reinforcement
