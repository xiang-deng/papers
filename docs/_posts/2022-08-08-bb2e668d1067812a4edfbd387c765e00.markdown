The recommendation of items based on the sequential past users preferences has evolved in the last few years, mostly due to deep learning approaches, such as BERT4Rec. However, in scientific fields, recommender systems for recommending the next best item are not widely used. The main goal of this work is to improve the results for the recommendation of the next best item in scientific domains using sequence aware datasets and algorithms. In the first part of this work, we present the Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
