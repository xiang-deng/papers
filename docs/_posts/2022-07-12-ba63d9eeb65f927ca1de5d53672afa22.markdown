Data-centric applications are increasingly more common, causing issues brought on by the discrepancy between processor and memory technologies to be increasingly more apparent. Near-Data Processing (NDP) is an approach to mitigate this issue. It proposes moving some of the computation close to the memory, thus allowing for reduced data movement and aiding data-intensive workloads. Analytical database queries are very commonly used in NDP research due to their intrinsics usage of  Cites: Challenges and opportunities with Big Data 2011-1
