In past years, the world has switched to many-core and multi-core shared memory architectures. As a result, there is a growing need to utilize these architectures by introducing shared memory parallelization schemes to software applications. OpenMP is the most comprehensive API that implements such schemes, characterized by a readable interface. Nevertheless, introducing OpenMP into code is challenging due to pervasive pitfalls in management of parallel shared memory. To Cites: A syntactic neural model for general-purpose code generation
