A growing literature on human-AI decision-making investigates strategies for combining human judgment with statistical models to improve decision-making. Research in this area often evaluates proposed improvements to models, interfaces, or workflows by demonstrating improved predictive performance on ground truth labels. However, this practice overlooks a key difference between human judgments and model predictions. Whereas humans reason about broader phenomena of Cites: Does the whole exceed its parts? the effect of ai explanations on
