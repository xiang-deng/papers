Activities of remote guidance are essential in the Industry sector to overcome emerging problems. One important technology to cre-ate a common ground between distributed team-members is Mixed Reality (MR). On-site collaborators can receive instructions from remote experts, informing where to act, and what to do. Neverthe-less, most studies have focused on synchronous use-cases, where team-members can interact in real-time. Hence, an opportunity exists to explore asynchronous …
