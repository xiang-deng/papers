Multi-task learning aims to boost the generalization performance of multiple related tasks simultaneously by leveraging information contained in those tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning framework, where we utilize prior knowledge about the relations between features. We also impose a penalty on the coefficients changing for each specific feature to ensure related tasks have similar coefficients on common features shared among them. In addition, we capture a common set of Cites: BAM! Born-Again Multi-Task Networks for Natural Language
