This study examines the ability of GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT) and GPT-4 models to generate poems in the style of specific authors using zero-shot and many-shot prompts (which use the maximum context length of 8192 tokens). We assess the performance of models that are not fine-tuned for generating poetry in the style of specific authors, via automated evaluation. Our findings indicate that without fine-tuning, even when provided with the maximum number of 17 poem examples (8192 …
