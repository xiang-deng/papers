Recent years have witnessed the burgeoning of data visualization (DV) systems in both the research and the industrial communities since they provide vivid and powerful tools to convey the insights behind the massive data. A necessary step to visualize data is through creating suitable specifications in some declarative visualization languages (DVLs, eg, Vega-Lite, ECharts). Due to the steep learning curve of mastering DVLs, automatically generating DVs via natural language Cites: A syntactic neural model for general-purpose code generation
