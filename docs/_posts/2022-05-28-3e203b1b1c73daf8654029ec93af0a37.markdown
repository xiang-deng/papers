Deep graph learning has achieved remarkable progresses in both business and scientific areas ranging from finance and e-commerce, to drug and advanced material discovery. Despite these progresses, how to ensure various deep graph learning algorithms behave in a socially responsible manner and meet regulatory compliance requirements becomes an emerging problem, especially in risk-sensitive domains. Trustworthy graph learning (TwGL) aims to solve the above problems from  Cites: Adaptive recursive neural network for target-dependent twitter
