With the depletion of globally available water resources and the rapid development of cities, helping managers of urban water departments formulate management plans and accurately forecast urban daily water supply (UDWS) is important. In this paper, to improve the ability of the model to process complex feature information, we proposed a new UDWS forecasting model that adopts the idea of sequence decomposition, secondary granularity reconstruction, and integration forecasting …
