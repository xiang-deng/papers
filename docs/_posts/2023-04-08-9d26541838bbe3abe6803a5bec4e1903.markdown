Entity alignment refers to discovering identical entity pairs in two knowledge graphs, which is a significant task in knowledge fusion. Early automated entity alignment techniques are based mainly on similarity calculation and comparing symbolic features, ie, entity names, between entities. Nevertheless, such methods performance would reduce significantly when the difference between knowledge graphs is enormous because of relying on predefined comparison rules.
