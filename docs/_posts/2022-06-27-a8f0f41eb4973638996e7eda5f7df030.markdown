Although dialogue systems based on the Seq2Seq model have achieved success, they suffer from tending to generate general responses. Recent works have shown that selecting external knowledge is helpful for dialogue systems to generate informative and diverse responses. However, selecting appropriate knowledge from an unlabeled knowledge set, which is referred to as unsupervised knowledge selection, remains a tricky challenge. Therefore, we propose a dual contrastive  Cites: A knowledge-grounded neural conversation model
