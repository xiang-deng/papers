Programmatic Reinforcement Learning is the study of learning algorithms that can leverage partial symbolic knowledge provided in expressive high-level domain specific languages. The aim of such algorithms is to learn agents that are reliable, secure, and transparent. This means that such agents can be expected to learn desirable behaviors with limited data, while provably maintaining some essential correctness invariant, and providing insights into their decision mechanisms which  Cites: Neuro-symbolic program synthesis
