Multi-document grounded dialogue systems (DGDS) belong to a class of conversational agents that answer users requests by finding supporting knowledge from a collection of documents. Most previous studies aim to improve the knowledge retrieval model or propose more effective ways to incorporate external knowledge into a parametric generation model. These methods, however, focus on retrieving knowledge from mono-granularity language units (eg passages, sentences, or spans Cites: Retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive nlp tasks
