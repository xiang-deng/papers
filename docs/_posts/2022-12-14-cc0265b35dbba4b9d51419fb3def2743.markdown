Due to computational advances in the past decades, so-called intelligent systems can learn from increasingly complex data, analyze situations, and support users in their decision-making to address them. However, in practice, the complexity of these intelligent systems renders the user hardly able to comprehend the inherent decision logic of the underlying machine learning model. As a result, the adoption of this technology, especially for high-stake scenarios, is hampered. In this context  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
