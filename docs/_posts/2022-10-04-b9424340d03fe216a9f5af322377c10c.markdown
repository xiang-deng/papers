The graph convolutional network (GCN)-based clustering approaches have achieved the impressive performance due to strong ability of exploiting the topological structure. The adjacency graph seriously affects the clustering performance, especially for non-graph data. Existing approaches usually conduct two independent steps, ie, constructing a fixed graph structure and then graph embedding representation learning by GCN. However, constructed graph structure  Cites: Adaptive Graph Encoder for Attributed Graph Embedding
