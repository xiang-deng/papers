Airplane detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has drawn much attention owing to the success of deep learning methods. However, the development of fine-grained airplane detection in SAR images is still in a dilemma due to the small inter-class variance and the large intra-class variance in complex scenes with strong interference from the background. In addition, the class imbalance problem in multi-class fine-grained airplane recognition also significantly limits the direct application  Cites: Simple copy-paste is a strong data augmentation method for
