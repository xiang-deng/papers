Multi-document machine reading comprehension has become a hot topic in natural language processing due to its more realistic setting and wider applications. However, how to effectively exploit the information of multiple documents and the question is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end reading comprehension model with the utilization of question categories. To compress the search space of the answer and pinpoint it more precisely, we make the best use of Cites: Triviaqa: A large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for
