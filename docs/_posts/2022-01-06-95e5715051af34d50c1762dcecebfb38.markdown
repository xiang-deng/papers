Abstract Adverse Drug Events (ADE) are life threatening and underreported. Thus, newmethods for monitoring ADEs need to be considered. People may discuss ADEson Twitter which could therefore be used as an additional data source for ADEs. Machine learning models are used to identify Tweets containing ADEs, however theyrequire annotated data. Annotation is costly; therefore, it is desirable to minimizeannotation time. Active Learning (AL) seeks to minimize the required data Cites: Automated suggestion of tests for identifying likelihood of adverse
