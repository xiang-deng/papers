Multimodal event detection plays a pivotal role in social media analysis, yet remains challenging due to the large differences between images and texts, noisy contexts and the intricate correspondence of different modalities. To address these issues, we introduce a multimodal graph message propagation network (MGMP), a layer-wise approach that aggregates the multi-view context and integrates images and texts simultaneously. In particular, MGMP constructs visual and textual graphs and Cites: A language-independent neural network for event detection
