Today s fast changing workplace necessitates constant reskilling of the workforce at both the corporate and national level. Current approaches to reskilling depend on manual logic, which can be time-consuming and expensive due to their dependence on manual labour. In this paper, we propose a scalable machine-learning driven alternative by introducing a method to make reskilling recommendations using word embeddings of skill keywords trained on a corpus of historical job listings and Cites: Fine-tuning pretrained language models: Weight initializations
