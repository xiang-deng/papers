Abstract Machine learning tools, particularly artificial neural networks (ANN), have become ubiquitous in many scientific disciplines, and machine learning-based techniques flourish not only because of the expanding computational power and the increasing availability of labeled data sets but also because of the increasingly powerful training algorithms and refined topologies of ANN. Some refined topologies were initially motivated by neuronal network architectures found in the brain, such as …
