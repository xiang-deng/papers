Recently, learning from vast unlabeled data, especially self-supervised learning, has been emerging and attracting widespread attention. Self-supervised learning followed by supervised fine-tuning on a few labeled examples can significantly improve label efficiency and outperform standard supervised training using fully annotated data. In this work, we present a novel hard negative-based self-supervised deep learning paradigm, named HNSSL. Specifically, we design a student-teacher  Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
