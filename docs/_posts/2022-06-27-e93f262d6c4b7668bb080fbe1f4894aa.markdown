We suggest that learning word representations in an order similar to that which children learn may affect properties of those representations. We propose the creation of synthetic datasets to study this question and introduce a method and tool to reorder existing datasets so that new words appear over time in an order that matches existing data on natural word order acquisition in humans. We show that word representations learned in a more natural order differ in some respects from …
