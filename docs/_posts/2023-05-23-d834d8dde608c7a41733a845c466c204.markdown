The paper proposes a linguistic constructions translation method based on recurrent neural networks. The novelty of the study lies in the fact that to ensure the interaction of software agents representing subjects within supply chains, four artificial neural network models for the translation of the linguistic structures were created, a criterion for evaluating the training effectiveness of the proposed models was selected, and the parameters of the proposed models were identified based on the Adam method Cites: Syntactically Supervised Transformers for Faster Neural Machine
