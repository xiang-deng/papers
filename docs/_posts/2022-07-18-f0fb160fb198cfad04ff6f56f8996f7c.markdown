Recently, the research about knowledge graphs (KGs) which contain a large number of triples, has gained massive attention. Many knowledge graph embedding methods are proposed to tackle the knowledge graph completion task. In real applications, knowledge graphs are applied not only in a centralized way but also in a decentralized manner. We study the problem of learning knowledge graph embeddings for a set of federated knowledge graphs, where their raw triples are not  Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
