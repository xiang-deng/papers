Despite recent advances in natural language understanding and generation, and decades of research on the development of conversational bots, building automated agents that can carry on rich open-ended conversations with humans in the wild remains a formidable challenge. In this work we develop a real-time, open-ended dialogue system that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to power a bot s conversational skill at scale. Our work pairs the succinct embedding of the Cites: DiscoFuse: A Large-Scale Dataset for Discourse-based Sentence
