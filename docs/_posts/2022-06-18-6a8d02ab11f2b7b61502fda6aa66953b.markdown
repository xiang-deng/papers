Rainfall–runoff modeling is a complex hydrological issue that still has room for improvement. This study developed a coupled bidirectional long short‐term memory (LSTM) with sequence‐to‐sequence (Seq2Seq) learning (BiLSTM‐Seq2seq) model to simulate multi‐step‐ahead runoff for flood events. The bidirectional LSTM with Seq2Seq learning (LSTM‐Seq2Seq) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) was set as benchmarks. The results show that:(1) root mean absolute error is reduced by …
