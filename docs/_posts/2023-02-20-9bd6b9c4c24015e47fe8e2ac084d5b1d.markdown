Accurate measurement of the geometric parameters of trees is a vital part of forest inventory in forestry management. Aerial and terrestrial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors are currently used in forest inventory as an effective and efficient means of forest data collection. Many recent approaches to processing and interpreting this data make use of supervised machine learning algorithms such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) due to their advantages in accuracy, robustness and Cites: Meta pseudo labels
