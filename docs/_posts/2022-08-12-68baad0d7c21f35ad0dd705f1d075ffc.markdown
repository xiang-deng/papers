Gathering cyber threat intelligence from open sources is becoming increasingly important for maintaining and achieving a high level of security as systems become larger and more complex. However, these open sources are often subject to information overload. It is therefore useful to apply machine learning models that condense the amount of information to what is necessary. Yet, previous studies and applications have shown that existing classifiers are not able to extract specific Cites: Perfect: Prompt-free and efficient few-shot learning with language
