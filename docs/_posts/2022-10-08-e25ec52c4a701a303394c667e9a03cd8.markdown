Dialogue state tracking (DST) is an essential sub-task for task-oriented dialogue systems. Recent work has focused on deep neural models for DST. However, the neural models require a large dataset for training. Furthermore, applying them to another domain needs a new dataset because the neural models are generally trained to imitate the given dataset. In this paper, we propose Schema Encoding for Transferable Dialogue State Tracking (SETDST), which is a neural DST method for …
