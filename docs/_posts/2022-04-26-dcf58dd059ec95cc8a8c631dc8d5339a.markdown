Vision outlookers improve the performance of vision transformers, which implement a self-attention mechanism by adding outlook attention, a form of local attention. In natural language processing, as has been the case in computer vision and other domains, transformer-based models constitute the state-of-the-art for most processing tasks. In this domain, too, many authors have argued and demonstrated the importance of local context. We present and evaluate an outlook attention Cites: Unsupervised question answering by cloze translation
