Machine learning methods strive to acquire a robust model during training that can generalize well to test samples, even under distribution shifts. However, these methods often suffer from a performance drop due to unknown test distributions. Test-time adaptation (TTA), an emerging paradigm, has the potential to adapt a pre-trained model to unlabeled data during testing, before making predictions. Recent progress in this paradigm highlights the significant benefits of utilizing unlabeled  Cites: Efficient Test Time Adapter Ensembling for Low-resource
