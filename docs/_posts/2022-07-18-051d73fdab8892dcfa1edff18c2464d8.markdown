Building automatic translation systems to overcome language barriers and build bridges between people from different cultures has a long history. A robust machine translation (MT) engine which is capable of accurately and rapidly translating one language to another can benefit people across the globe. Since 1950s, scientists have been devoted to proposing various practical systems such as rule-based MT [42, 176], example-based MT [126, 162] and statistical MT [13, 89, 91]. In recent …
