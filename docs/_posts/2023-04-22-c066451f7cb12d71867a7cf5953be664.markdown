Fine-tuning pre-trained models has recently yielded remarkable performance gains in graph neural networks (GNNs). In addition to pre-training techniques, inspired by the latest work in the natural language fields, more recent work has shifted towards applying effective fine-tuning approaches, such as parameter-efficient tuning (delta tuning). However, given the substantial differences between GNNs and transformer-based models, applying such approaches directly to GNNs proved to be less Cites: Few-Shot Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning is Better and Cheaper
