The corrosion behavior of marine engineering steels in marine environment is an extremely complex process, which poses great challenge to accurately evaluate the corrosion resistance of various stees in different marine environment. Owing to the wide application of machine learning (ML) approaches and the accumulation of corrosion data of different steels in natural marine environment, herein, we reported eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML models for predicting the corrosion rate in Cites: Intelligible and explainable machine learning: best practices and
