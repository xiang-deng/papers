A nanophotonic neural network (N‐PNN) architecture is proposed with compact nanophotonic scattering units and a hybrid structure of silicon and nonvolatile arrayed Sb2Se3. This PNN can execute deep neural networks (DNN) classification and identification tasks with a broad operation bandwidth and very compact footprint. The reconstruction of the convolutional kernel core is realized by digitally switching the phase state of the Sb2Se3 array. Based on a three‐dimensional finite‐difference …
