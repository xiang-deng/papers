With the demanding need for deploying dialogue systems in new domains with less cost, zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), which tracks user s requirements in task-oriented dialogues without training on desired domains, draws attention increasingly. Although prior works have leveraged question-answering (QA) data to reduce the need for in-domain training in DST, they fail to explicitly model knowledge transfer and fusion for tracking dialogue states. To address this issue, we propose …
