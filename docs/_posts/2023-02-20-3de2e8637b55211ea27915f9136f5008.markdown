We present Rhino, a system for accelerating tensor programs with automatic parallelization on AI platform for real production environment. It transforms a tensor program written for a single device into an equivalent distributed program that is capable of scaling up to thousands of devices with no user configuration. Rhino firstly works on a semantically independent intermediate representation of tensor programs, which facilitates its generalization to unprecedented applications  Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
