Deep learning models have become state of the art in many language modelling tasks. Among such tasks, source code auto-completion is one of the important areas of research. This paper presents various methodologies for source code auto- completion using different Deep Learning models for Python and CSharp Programming Languages. In a resource-limited environment, it is paramount to reduce various overheads: one way of achieving that is to use the code sequences to Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
