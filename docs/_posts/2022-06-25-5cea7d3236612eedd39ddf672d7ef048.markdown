This thesis tackles the veracity and variety challenges of big data, especially focusing on graphs and relational data. We start with proposing a class of graph association rules (GARs) to specify regularities between entities in graphs, which capture both missing links and inconsistencies. A GAR is a combination of a graph pattern and a dependency; it may take as predicates machine learning classifiers for link prediction. We formalize association deduction with GARs in terms of the chase, and
