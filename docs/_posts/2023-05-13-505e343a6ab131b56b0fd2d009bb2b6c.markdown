State-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence models often require autoregressive decoding, which can be highly expensive. However, for some downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and resource allocation, the actual decoding output is not needed just a scalar attribute of this sequence. In these scenarios, where for example knowing the quality of a system s output to predict poor performance prevails over knowing the output itself, is it possible to bypass the  Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
