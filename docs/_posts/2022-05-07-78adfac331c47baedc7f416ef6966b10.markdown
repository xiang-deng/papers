Speaker recognition on household devices, such as smart speakers, features several challenges:(i) robustness across a vast number of heterogeneous domains (households),(ii) short utterances,(iii) possibly absent speaker labels of the enrollment data (passive enrollment), and (iv) presence of unknown persons (guests). While many commercial products exist, there is less published research and no publicly-available evaluation protocols or open-source baselines.
