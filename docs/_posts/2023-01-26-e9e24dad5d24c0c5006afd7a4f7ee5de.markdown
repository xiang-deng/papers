Symbolic propagation methods based on linear abstraction play a significant role in neural network verification. This paper proposes the notion of multi-path back-propagation for such methods. Existing methods are viewed as using only a single back-propagation path to calculate the upper and lower bounds of each node in a given neural network, so they are specific instances under the proposed notion. Leveraging multiple back-propagation paths effectively improves the accuracy of this …
