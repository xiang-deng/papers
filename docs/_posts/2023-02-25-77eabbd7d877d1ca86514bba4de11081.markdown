Social Internet of Things (SIoT), a promising and emerging paradigm that injects the notion of social networking into smart objects (ie, things), paving the way for the next generation of Internet of Things. However, due to the risks and uncertainty, a crucial and urgent problem to be settled is establishing reliable relationships within SIoT, that is, trust evaluation. Graph neural networks for trust evaluation typically adopt a straightforward way such as one-hot or node2vec to comprehend node Cites: KEPLER: A Unified Model for Knowledge Embedding and Pre
