In this paper, we have defined a novel task of affective feedback synthesis that deals with generating feedback for input text & corresponding image in a similar way as humans respond towards the multimodal data. A feedback synthesis system has been proposed and trained using ground-truth human comments along with image- text input. We have also constructed a large-scale dataset consisting of image, text, Twitter user comments, and the number of likes for the comments by crawling the Cites: Neural extractive summarization with side information
