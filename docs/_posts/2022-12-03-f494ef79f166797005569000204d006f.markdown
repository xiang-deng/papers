Most of the existing machine learning (ML)-based models for liquefaction assessment of soils are black-box in nature. Database considered in the existing studies for model development is imbalanced. In this study, an attempt is made to include the coefficient of permeability and thickness of the critical layer from the available information to the existing database. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm is used for the model development in a probabilistic …
