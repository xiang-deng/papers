Abstract Models can have different outcomes based on the different types of inputs; the training data used to build the model will change its output (a data-centric outcome), while the hyperparameter selection can also affect the model s output and performance (a model-centric outcome). When building classification models, data scientists generally focus on model performance as the key metric, often focusing on accuracy. However, other metrics should be considered during model development …
