Soil salinization is a major environmental risk caused by natural or human activities especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Machine learning for rapidly monitoring large-scale spatial soil salinization becomes possible. However, machine learning often needs large training samples and obtaining extensive soil salinization information by field investigation is laborious and difficult. In practice, the field soil sampling datasets are often sparse and non-normally distributed. The intricacy of  Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
