We consider the smooth convex-concave bilinearly-coupled saddle-point problem, $\min_ {\mathbf {x}}\max_ {\mathbf {y}}~ F (\mathbf {x})+ H (\mathbf {x},\mathbf {y})-G (\mathbf {y}) $, where one has access to stochastic first-order oracles for $ F $, $ G $ as well as the bilinear coupling function $ H $. Building upon standard stochastic extragradient analysis for variational inequalities, we present a stochastic\emph {accelerated gradient-extragradient (AG-EG)} descent-ascent algorithm that  Cites: Stochastic variance reduction methods for policy evaluation
