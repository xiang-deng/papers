The Codex model has demonstrated extraordinary competence in synthesizing code from natural language problem descriptions. However, in order to reveal unknown failure modes and hidden biases, such large-scale models must be systematically subjected to multiple and diverse evaluation studies. In this work, we evaluate the code synthesis capabilities of the Codex model based on a set of 115 Python problem statements from a popular competitive programming portal: HackerRank  Cites: Neuro-symbolic program synthesis
