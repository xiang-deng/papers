This study aims to compare the performance of the text-preprocessing methods namely automatic and semi-automatic preprocessing techniques in the CNN algorithm to carry out learning on disaster report dataset. The experimental results on the disaster dataset with a total of 200 records with the automatic text preprocessing technique produce an average accuracy of 0.81 and 1 with training data of 80: 20 and 90: 10. While in the optimize model that is semi-automatic text preprocessing Cites: Natural language processing for analyzing disaster recovery
