Objective To investigate the value of ultrasonographic data in predicting total knee replacement (TKR). Design Data from the Musculoskeletal Pain in Ullensaker study (MUST) was linked to the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register to form a 57 year prospective cohort study of 630 persons (69% women, mean (SD) age 64 (8.7) years). We examined the predictive power of ultrasound (US) features, ie osteophytes, meniscal extrusion, synovitis in the suprapatellar recess, femoral Cites: Prediction of total knee replacement and diagnosis of osteoarthritis
