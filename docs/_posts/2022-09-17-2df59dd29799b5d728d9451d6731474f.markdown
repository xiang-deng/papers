Deep neural networks as an end-to-end approach lack robustness from an application point of view, as it is very difficult to fix an obvious problem without retraining the model, for example, when a model consistently predicts positive when seeing the word terrible. Meanwhile, it is less stressed that the commonly used attention mechanism is likely to over-fit by being overly sparse, so that some key positions in the input sequence could be overlooked by the network.
