Accurate travel time prediction (TTP) is a significant aspect in the intelligent transportation system (ITS). Travel times of certain road segments explicitly reflect the traffic conditions of those sections. Effective TTP of road segments is instrumental in route planning, traffic control, and traffic management. However, the accuracy of TTP is greatly affected by the intricate topological structure of traffic network and the dynamics of traffic flow over time. This paper develops a TTP method based on the …
