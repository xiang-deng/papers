Abstract In recent years, Recurrent Neural Network based Neural Machine Translation (RNN-based NMT) equipped with an attention mechanism from the decoder to encoder, has achieved great advancements and exhibited good performance in many language pairs. However, little work has been done on the attention mechanism for the target side, which has the potential to further improve NMT. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel bilingual attention …
