The ability to handle objects in cluttered environment has been long anticipated by robotic community. However, most of works merely focus on manipulation instead of rendering hidden semantic information in cluttered objects. In this work, we introduce the scene graph for embodied exploration in cluttered scenarios to solve this problem. To validate our method in cluttered scenario, we adopt the Manipulation Question Answering (MQA) tasks as our test benchmark, which requires an Cites: Alfred: A benchmark for interpreting grounded instructions for
