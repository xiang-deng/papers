Code review is an effective software quality assurance activity; however, it is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Thus, a number of generation-based automatic code review (ACR) approaches have been proposed recently, which leverage deep learning techniques to automate various activities in the code review process (eg, code revision generation and review comment generation). We find the previous works carry three main limitations. First, the ACR approaches have been shown to be …
