Deep Learning (DL) systems have proliferated in many applications, requiring specialized hardware accelerators and chips. In the nano-era, devices have become increasingly more susceptible to permanent and transient faults. Therefore, we need an efficient methodology for analyzing the resilience of advanced DL systems against such faults, and understand how the faults in neural accelerator chips manifest as errors at the DL application level, where faults can lead to undetectable …
