With the advent of big data and the information age, the data magnitude of various complex networks is growing rapidly. Many real-life situations cannot be portrayed by ordinary networks, while hypergraphs have the ability to describe and characterize higher order relationships, which have attracted extensive attention from academia and industry in recent years. Firstly, this paper described the development process, the application areas, and the existing review research of hypergraphs; secondly …
