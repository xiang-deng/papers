Temporal action localization (TAL) is a prevailing task due to its great application potential. Existing works in this field mainly suffer from two weaknesses:(1) They often neglect the multi-label case and only focus on temporal modeling.(2) They ignore the semantic information in class labels and only use the visual information. To solve these problems, we propose a novel Co-Occurrence Relation Module (CORM) that explicitly models the co-occurrence relationship between actions  Cites: Phrase-bert: Improved phrase embeddings from bert with an
