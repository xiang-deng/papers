This paper proposes a simple Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) framework that considers the entity types. The KGE finds appropriate representations of entities and relations by learning structured information in triples and uses these representations to predict the missing links in a knowledge graph (KG). The entity types are included in many KGs, but most of the existing methods ignored its potential for the link prediction task. The proposed framework, which is called EETCRL (Entity and Entity Cites: Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge
