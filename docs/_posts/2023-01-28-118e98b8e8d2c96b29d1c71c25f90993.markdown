Complex Query Answering (CQA) over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) has attracted a lot of attention to potentially support many applications. Given that KGs are usually incomplete, neural models are proposed to answer logical queries by parameterizing set operators with complex neural networks. However, such methods usually train neural set operators with a large number of entity and relation embeddings from zero, where whether and how the embeddings or the neural set operators contribute Cites: Smore: Knowledge graph completion and multi-hop reasoning in
