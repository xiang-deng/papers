Abstract Many studies on Graph Data Augmentation (GDA) approaches have emerged. The techniques have rapidly improved performance for various graph neural network (GNN) models, increasing the current state-of-the-art accuracy by absolute values of 4.20%, 5.50%, and 4.40% on Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed, respectively. The success is attributed to two integral properties of relational approaches: topology-level and feature-level augmentation. This work provides an …
