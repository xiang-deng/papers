Breast cancer is a common health problem in women, with one out of eight women dying from breast cancer. Many women ignore the need for breast cancer diagnosis as the treatment is not secure due to the exposure of radioactive rays. The breast cancer screening techniques suffer from non-invasive, unsafe radiations, and specificity of diagnosis of tumor in the breast. The deep learning techniques are widely used in medical imaging. This paper aims to provide a detailed survey Cites: Deep neural networks improve radiologists performance in breast
