High throughput sequencing technology leads to a significant increase in the number of generated protein sequences and the anchor database UniProt doubles approximately every two years. This large set of annotated data is used by many bioinformatics algorithms. Searching within these databases, typically without using any annotations, is challenging due to the variable lengths of the entries and the used non-standard comparison measures. A promising strategy to address these Cites: Progen: Language modeling for protein generation
