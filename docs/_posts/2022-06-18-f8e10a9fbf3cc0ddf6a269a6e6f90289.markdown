We study monotone inclusions and monotone variational inequalities, as well as their generalizations to non-monotone settings. We first show that the Extra Anchored Gradient (EAG) algorithm, originally proposed by Yoon and Ryu [2021] for unconstrained convex-concave min-max optimization, can be applied to solve the more general problem of Lipschitz monotone inclusion. More specifically, we prove that the EAG solves Lipschitz monotone inclusion problems with an\emph …
