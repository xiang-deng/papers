Previous works on emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) follow a two-step paradigm, which can be summarized as first producing context-independent features via fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) and then analyzing contextual information and dialogue structure information among the extracted features. However, we discover that this paradigm has several limitations. Accordingly, we propose a novel paradigm, ie, exploring contextual information and dialogue …
