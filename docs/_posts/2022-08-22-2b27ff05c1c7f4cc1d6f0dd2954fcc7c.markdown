Weak supervision has been applied to various Natural Language Understanding tasks in recent years. Due to technical challenges with scaling weak supervision to work on long-form documents, spanning up to hundreds of pages, applications in the document understanding space have been limited. At Lexion, we built a weak supervision-based system tailored for long-form (10-200 pages long) PDF documents. We use this platform for building dozens of language understanding Cites: Latent retrieval for weakly supervised open domain question
