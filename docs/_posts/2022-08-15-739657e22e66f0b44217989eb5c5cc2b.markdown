Measuring the distance between ontological elements is a fundamental component for any matching solutions. String-based distance metrics relying on discrete symbol operations are notorious for shallow syntactic matching. In this study, we explore Wasserstein distance metric across ontology concept embeddings. Wasserstein distance metric targets continuous space that can incorporate linguistic, structural, and logical information. In our exploratory study, we use a pre-trained word Cites: Lifted rule injection for relation embeddings
