Textbook Question Answering (TQA) is the task of answering diagram and non-diagram questions given large multi-modal contexts consisting of abundant text and diagrams. Deep text understandings and effective learning of diagram semantics are important for this task due to its specificity. In this paper, we propose a Weakly Supervised learning method for TQA (WSTQ), which regards the incompletely accurate results of essential intermediate procedures for this task as supervision to  Cites: RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach
