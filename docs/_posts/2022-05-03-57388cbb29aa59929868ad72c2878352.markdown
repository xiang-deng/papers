The Recurrent neural network (RNN) has reported impressive performance on processing requirements in sequence labeling tasks. RNN can recall previously series knowledge and can thereby be utilized to solve tasks related to natural language processing (NLP). Recognition of a named entity (NER) is a popular NLP activity and can be found a classification challenge. Recognition of named entities is the method of recognizing various entities in a particular context. The role of Cites: Unsupervised named-entity extraction from the web: An
