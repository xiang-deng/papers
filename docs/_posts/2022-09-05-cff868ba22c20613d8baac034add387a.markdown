Flaky tests are tests that yield different outcomes when run on the same version of a program. This non-deterministic behaviour plagues continuous integration with false signals, wasting developers time and reducing their trust in test suites. Studies highlighted the importance of keeping tests flakiness-free. Recently, the research community has been pushing forward the detection of flaky tests by suggesting many static and dynamic approaches. While promising, those approaches mainly focus on  Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
