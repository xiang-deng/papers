Although the pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieved great success in computer vision, adapting a ViT to various image and video tasks is challenging because of its heavy computation and storage burdens, where each model needs to be independently and comprehensively fine-tuned to different tasks, limiting its transferability in different domains. To address this challenge, we propose an effective adaptation approach for Transformer, namely AdaptFormer, which can … Cites: ‪Towards a unified view of parameter-efficient transfer learning‬
