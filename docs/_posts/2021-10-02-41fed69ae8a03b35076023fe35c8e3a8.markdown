The rapid development of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in the recent decade has spurred an outburst of their applications in many research fields. In the chemistry domain, machine learning has been widely used to aid in drug screening, drug toxicity prediction, quantitative structureactivity relationship prediction, anti-cancer synergy score prediction, etc. This review is dedicated to the application of machine learning in drug response prediction. Specifically, we focus Cites: Strategies for pre-training graph neural networks
