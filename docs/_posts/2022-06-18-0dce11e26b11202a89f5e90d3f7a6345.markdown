Many anomaly detection techniques have been adopted by Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for improving self-diagnosing efficiency and infrastructures security. However, they are usually associated with the issues of computational-hungry and black box. Thus, it becomes important to ensure that the detection is not only accurate but also energy-efficient and trustworthy. In this paper, we propose an Energy-efficient And Trustworthy Unsupervised anomaly detection framework Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
