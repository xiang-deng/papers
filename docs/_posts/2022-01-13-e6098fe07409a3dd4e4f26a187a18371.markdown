Lexical taxonomies and distributional representations are largely used to support a wide range of NLP applications, including semantic similarity measurements. Recently, several scholars have proposed new approaches to combine those resources into unified representation preserving distributional and knowledge-based lexical features. In this paper, we propose and implement TaxoVec, a novel approach to selecting word embeddings based on their ability to preserve taxonomic Cites: Document modeling with gated recurrent neural network for
