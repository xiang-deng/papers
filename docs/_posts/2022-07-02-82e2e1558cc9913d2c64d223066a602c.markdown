In data-driven anti-fraud engineering for online payment services, the integration of proper function modules is an effective way to further improve detection performance by overcoming the inability of single-function methods to cope with complex and varied frauds. However, a qualified integration is really inaccessible under multiple demanding requirements, ie, improving detection performance, ensuring decision explainability, and limiting processing latency and computing consumption.
