As an upstream task of iris recognition, iris segmentation plays a vital role in multiple subsequent tasks, including localization and matching. A slight bias in iris segmentation often results in obvious performance degradation of the iris recognition system. In the paper, we propose an Iris U-transformer (IrisUsformer) for accurate and reliable iris segmentation. For better accuracy, we elaborately design IrisUsformer by adopting position-sensitive operation and re-packaging transformer Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
