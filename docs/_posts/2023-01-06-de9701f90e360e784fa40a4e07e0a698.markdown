In the computer vision community, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), first proposed in the 1980 s, have become the standard visual classification model. Recently, as alternatives to CNNs, Capsule Networks (CapsNets) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been proposed. CapsNets, which were inspired by the information processing of the human brain, are considered to have more inductive bias than CNNs, whereas ViTs are considered to have less inductive bias than …
