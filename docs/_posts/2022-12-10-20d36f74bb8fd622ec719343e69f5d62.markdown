Federated learning (FL) is a communication-efficient machine learning paradigm to leverage distributed data at the network edge. Nevertheless, FL usually fails to train a high-quality model from the networks, where the edge nodes collect noisy labeled data. To tackle this challenge, this paper focuses on developing an innovative robust FL. We consider two kinds of networks with different data distribution. Firstly, we design a reweighted FL under a full-data network, where all edge nodes are Cites: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning
