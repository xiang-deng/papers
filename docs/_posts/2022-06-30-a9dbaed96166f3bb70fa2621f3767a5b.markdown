The combination of deep neural networks with reinforcement learning (RL) shows great promise for solving otherwise intractable learning tasks. However, practical demonstrations of deep reinforcement learning remain scarce. The challenges in using deep RL for a given task can be grouped into two categories, broadly “What to learn from experience?” and “What experience to learn from?”
