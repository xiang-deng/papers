Abstract Few-Shot Event Classification (FSEC) aims at assigning event labels to unlabeled sentences when limited annotated samples are available. Existing works mainly focus on using meta-learning to overcome the low-resource problem that still requires abundant held-out classes for model learning and selection. Thus we propose to deal with the low-resource problem by utilizing prompts. Further, existing methods suffer from severe trigger biases that may result in ignorance of the context  Cites: True few-shot learning with language models
