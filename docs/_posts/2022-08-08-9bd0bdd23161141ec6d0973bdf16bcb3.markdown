Automatic source code summarization system aims to generate a valuable natural language description for a program, which can facilitate software development and maintenance, code categorization, and retrieval. However, previous sequence-based research did not consider the long-distance dependence and highly structured characteristics of source code simultaneously. In this article, we present a Transformer-based Graph-Augmented Source Code Summarization, denoted as GA Cites: Text summarization with pretrained encoders
