Devising an automatic Math Word Problem (MWP) solver has emerged as an important task in recent years. Various applications such as online education and intelligent assistants are expecting better MWP solvers to process complex user queries that involve numerical reasoning. Current seq2seq MWP solvers encounter two critical challenges: ordinal indices without semantics and insufficient training data. In this work, we propose Entity Random Indexing to equip indices with …
