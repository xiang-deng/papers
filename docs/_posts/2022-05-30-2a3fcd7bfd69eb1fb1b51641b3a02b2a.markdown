Fine-grained aspect-based sentiment analysis involves aspect term extraction and aspect sentiment classification. Most existing research methods address them in an independent fashion, which lack a mechanism to account for the relevant information between each other, and will also cause training redundancy and waste of resources. To solve the above problems, a joint model based on position embedding and graph convolutional network under the framework of multi-task learning is Cites: Effective LSTMs for target-dependent sentiment classification
