As our dependence on intelligent machines continues to grow, so does the demand for more transparent and interpretable models. In addition, the ability to explain the model generally is now the gold standard for building trust and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in critical domains. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to provide a suite of machine learning (ML) techniques that enable human users to understand, appropriately trust, and produce more Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
