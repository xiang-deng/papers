Contemporary neural networks have achieved a series of developments and successes in many aspects; however, when exposed to data outside the training distribution, they may fail to predict correct answers. In this work, we were concerned about this generalisation issue and thus analysed a broad set of models systematically and robustly over long stories. Related experiments were conducted based on the CLUTRR, which is a diagnostic benchmark suite that can analyse Cites: Learning by abstraction: The neural state machine
