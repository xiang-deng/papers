Abstract Just-in-time (JIT) defect prediction can help developers quickly identify whether a change is defective or not. The features extracted from changes play an essential role in building an accurate prediction model. In recent years, it has been considered effective to extract the semantic features of software code files by using code representation technology. However, how to extract semantic information from broken changing code snippets is still a challenging problem.
