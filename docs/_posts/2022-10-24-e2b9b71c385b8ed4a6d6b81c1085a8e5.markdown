Abstract Natural Language Generation (NLG) is the field of study that aims to endow agents with the ability to generate language to satisfy any stated communicative goal (CG). Today, NLG systems that converse (eg, Meena) and co-author (eg, Gmail SmartCompose) with humans aren t just deployable, but a familiar part of net-equipped societies. Models underlying today s systems eg, T5 [142], based on neural architectures like Transformers [180], are “end-to-end  in terms of their structure and …
