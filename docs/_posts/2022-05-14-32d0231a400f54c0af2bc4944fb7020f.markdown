There has been significant debate in the NLP community about whether or not attention weights can be used as an explanation-a mechanism for interpreting how important each input token is for a particular prediction. The validity of  attention as explanation  has so far been evaluated by computing the rank correlation between attention-based explanations and existing feature attribution explanations using LSTM-based models. In our work, we (i) compare the rank correlation between five Cites: ERASER: A benchmark to evaluate rationalized NLP models
