Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to analyze the sentiment polarity of a given aspect. The graph convolutional neural network model is widely used. However, most existing research focuses on mining the context-word-to-aspect-word dependencies of dependency trees based on the sentence itself without using much text-related external knowledge. In addition, the problem of reasonably capturing words outside the multihop grammatical distance and edge label hinders the effect of Cites: Aspect level sentiment classification with deep memory network
