The analysis of neuronal morphological data is essential to investigate the neuronal properties and brain mechanisms. The complex morphologies, absence of annotations, and sheer volume of these data pose significant challenges in neuronal morphological analysis, such as identifying neuron types and large-scale neuron retrieval, all of which require accurate measuring and efficient matching algorithms. Recently, many studies have been conducted to describe neuronal morphologies Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
