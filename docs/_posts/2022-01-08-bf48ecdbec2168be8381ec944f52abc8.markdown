While annotating normalized times in food security documents, we found that the semantically compositional annotation for time normalization (SCATE) scheme required several near-duplicate annotations to get the correct semantics for expressions like Nov. 7th to 11th 2021. To reduce this problem, we explored replacing SCATE s Sub-Interval property with a Super-Interval property, that is, making the smallest units (eg, 7th and 11th) rather than the largest units (eg, 2021) Cites: Universal dependencies v2: An evergrowing multilingual treebank
