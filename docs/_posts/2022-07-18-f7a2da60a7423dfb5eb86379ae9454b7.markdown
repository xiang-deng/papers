Deep learning-based object detection is a fundamental but challenging problem in computer vision field, has attracted a lot of study in recent years. State-of-the-art object detection methods rely on the selection of positive samples and negative samples, ie, called sample assignment, and the definition of a useful set for training, ie, called sample sampling heuristics. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the advanced anchor assignment and sampling approaches in deep learning  Cites: Learning from noisy anchors for one-stage object detection
