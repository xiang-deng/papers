Surrogate kernel-based methods offer a flexible solution to structured output prediction by leveraging the kernel trick in both input and output spaces. In contrast to energy-based models, they avoid to pay the cost of inference during training, while enjoying statistical guarantees. However, without approximation, these approaches are condemned to be used only on a limited amount of training data. In this paper, we propose to equip surrogate kernel methods with approximations based on  Cites: Learning and inference for structured prediction: A unifying
