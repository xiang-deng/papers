The most significant advantage of the unseen relation extraction is that it can recognize unlabeled relations. While Zero-Shot Learning can meet the requirements of the identification of unseen relation through relation description information without labeled datasets. However, unseen relation extraction requires an effective method in representation and generalization, which become a challenge for zero-shot learning approach. In this paper, we propose a Zero-Shot learning Relation …
