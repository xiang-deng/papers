The availability of large-scale, realistic vulnerability datasets is essential for both benchmarking existing techniques and developing effective new ones, especially those using data-driven (eg, machine/deep-learning based) approaches, for software security. Yet such datasets are critically lacking. A promising solution is to generate such datasets by injecting vulnerabilities into real-world normal programs, which are richly available. Thus, in this paper, we explore the feasibility of vulnerability injection …
