Today s most advanced machine-learning models are hardly scrutable. The key challenge for explainability methods is to help assisting researchers in opening up these black boxes, by revealing the strategy that led to a given decision, by characterizing their internal states or by studying the underlying data representation. To address this challenge, we have developed Xplique: a software library for explainability which includes representative explainability methods as well as  Cites: " Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any
