Hydrogen energy is promising renewable energy and specifically, hydrogen storage is a bottleneck to commercializing hydrogen energy. Researchers have relied on the synthesis of porous materials in physisorption and lowering the H2 binding energy of hydride materials in chemisorption, all of which have been conducted in a similar manner respectively. However, the development of hydrogen storage materials applicable to onboard system isn t found yet. Hence, we examined the phenomenon  Cites: Theoretical limits of hydrogen storage in metalorganic
