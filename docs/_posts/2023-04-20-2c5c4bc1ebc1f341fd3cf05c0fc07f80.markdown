Despite the success of autoregressive large language models in text generation, it remains a major challenge to generate text that satisfies complex constraints: sampling from the conditional distribution $\Pr (\text {text}|\alpha) $ is intractable for even the simplest lexical constraints $\alpha $. To overcome this challenge, we propose to use tractable probabilistic models to impose lexical constraints in autoregressive text generation, which we refer to as GeLaTo.
