As a new programming paradigm, neural network based machine learning has expanded its application to many real-world problems. Due to the black-box nature of neural networks, verifying and explaining their behavior is becoming increasingly important, especially when they are deployed in safety-critical applications. Existing verification work mostly focuses on qualitative verification which asks whether there exists an input (in a specified region) for a neural network such that a property (eg Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
