Event temporal reasoning aims at identifying the temporal relations between two or more events. However, knowledge conflicts arise when there is a mismatch between the actual temporal relations of events in the context and the prior knowledge or biases learned by the model. We first systematically define distinct kinds of bias in event temporal reasoning, which include event relation prior bias, tense bias, narrative bias, and dependency bias, as indicators to study knowledge conflicts. To …
