Big data have the characteristics of enormous volume, high velocity, diversity, value- sparsity, and uncertainty, which lead the knowledge learning from them full of challenges. With the emergence of crowdsourcing, versatile information can be obtained on-demand so that the wisdom of crowds is easily involved to facilitate the knowledge learning process. During the past thirteen years, researchers in the AI community made great efforts to remove the obstacles in the field of learning from Cites: Spectral methods meet EM: A provably optimal algorithm for
