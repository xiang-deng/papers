The aim of this thesis is to investigate how Machine Learning algorithms can be used to predict disruptions in fusion reactors. These events are called such because they disrupt a tokamak s ability to confine plasma and cause a great deal of damage to the structure and equipment. Tokamaks are the leading design principle in fusion reactor design, so is ITER, the largest soon-to-be-built reactor ever conceived; thus, phenomena such as these must be prevented to the best of our abilities, to avoid …
