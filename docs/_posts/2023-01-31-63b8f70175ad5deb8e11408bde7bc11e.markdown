Neural text transfer aims to change the style of a text sequence while keeping its original content. Due to the lack of parallel data, unsupervised learning-based approaches have gained considerable development. However, there are still several problems in these approaches:(1) The generated transferred sequences sometimes have inconsistencies between the transferred style and content, and (2) It is difficult to ensure sufficient preservation of the core semantics of original sequences in the …
