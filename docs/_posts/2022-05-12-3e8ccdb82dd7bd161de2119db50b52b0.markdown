In AI evaluation, performance is often calculated by averaging across various instances. But to fully understand the capabilities of an AI system, we need to understand the factors that cause its pattern of success and failure. In this paper, we present a new methodology to identify and build informative instance features that can provide explanatory and predictive power to analyse the behaviour of AI systems more robustly. The methodology builds on these relevant features that should relate Cites: Dynabench: Rethinking benchmarking in NLP
