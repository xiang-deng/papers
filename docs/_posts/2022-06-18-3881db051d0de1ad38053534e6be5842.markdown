 This paper proposes an attempt to realize coding assistance that generates Python code from natural language descriptions using neural machine translation. Although coding assistance with deep learning has recently become a major concern, few applications have used neural machine translation models. One of the major barriers is the shortage of a parallel corpus of natural language descriptions and source code. To overcome the shortage of parallel corpora, we propose a  Cites: Toward Code Generation: A Survey and Lessons from Semantic
