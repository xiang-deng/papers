Explainability of deep neural networks has been receiving increasing attention with regard to auditability and trustworthiness purposes. Of the various post-hoc explainability approaches, rule extraction methods assist to understand the logic that underpins their functioning. Whereas the rule-based solutions are directly managed and understood by practitioners, the use of intervals or crisp values in the antecedents that rely on numerical values might not be intuitive enough. In this case  Cites: Do feature attribution methods correctly attribute features?
