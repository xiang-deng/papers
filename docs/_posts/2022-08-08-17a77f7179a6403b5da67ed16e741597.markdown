We study multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with centralized training and decentralized execution. During the training, new agents may join, and existing agents may unexpectedly leave the training. In such situations, a standard deep MARL model must be trained again from scratch, which is very time-consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose a special network architecture with a few-shot learning algorithm that allows the number of agents to vary during centralized Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
