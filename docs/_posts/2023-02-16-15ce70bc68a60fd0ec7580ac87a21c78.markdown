Recent progress in information retrieval finds that embedding query and document representation into multi-vector yields a robust bi-encoder retriever on out-of-distribution datasets. In this paper, we explore whether late interaction, the simplest form of multi-vector, is also helpful to neural rerankers that only use the [CLS] vector to compute the similarity score. Although intuitively, the attention mechanism of rerankers at the previous layers already gathers the token-level information, we find  Cites: Passage Re-ranking with BERT
