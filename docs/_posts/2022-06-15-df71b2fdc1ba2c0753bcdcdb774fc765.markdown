Abstract Knowledge graph (KG) has increasingly been seen as a significant resource in financial applications (eg, risk control, auditing and anti-fraud). However, there are few prior studies that focus on multi-relational circles, extracting additional information under the completed KG and selecting similarity measures for knowledge representation. In this paper, we introduce multi-relational circles and propose a novel embedding model, which considers entity weights calculated by PageRank …
