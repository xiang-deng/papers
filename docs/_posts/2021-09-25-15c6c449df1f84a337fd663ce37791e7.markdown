We study the task of span-level emotion cause analysis (SECA), which is focused on identifying the specific emotion cause span (s) triggering a certain emotion in the text. Compared to the popular clause-level emotion cause analysis (CECA), it is a finer- grained emotion cause analysis (ECA) task. In this paper, we design a BERT-based graph attention network for emotion cause span (s) identification. The proposed model takes advantage of the structure of BERT to capture the relationship Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
