In this work we propose a pragmatic method that reduces the annotation cost for structured label spaces using active learning. Our approach leverages partial annotation, which reduces labeling costs for structured outputs by selecting only the most informative substructures for annotation. We also utilize selftraining to incorporate the current model s automatic predictions as pseudo-labels for unannotated sub-structures. A key challenge in effectively combining partial  Cites: Strata: Self-training with task augmentation for better few-shot
