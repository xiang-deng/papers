Text detection in natural images is a challenging problem due to variations in text size, aspect ratio, alignment and background complexity. This paper proposes a multiscale feature fusion convolutional neural network method to detect cursive and multi-language text in natural images. The proposed method combines VGG-16 features at multi-scales and multi-layers and creates a new convolutional feature map of shallow and deep layers. On top of convolutional feature map, a vertical text …
