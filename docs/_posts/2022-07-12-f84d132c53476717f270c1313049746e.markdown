Perhaps the applied nature of information retrieval research goes some way to explain the community s rich history of evaluating machine learning models holistically, understanding that efficacy matters but so does the computational cost incurred to achieve it. This is evidenced, for example, by more than a decade of research on efficient training and inference of large decision forest models in learning-to-rank. As the community adopts even more complex, neural network Cites: Pruning redundant mappings in transformer models via spectral
