Next-generation drone applications will be distributed, including tasks that need to run at the edge or in the cloud and interact with the drone in a smooth way. In this paper, we propose Fractus, an orchestration framework for the automated deployment of such applications in the drone-edge-cloud continuum. Fractus provides users with abstractions for describing the application s placement and communication requirements, allocates resources in a mission-aware fashion by Cites: Beecluster: drone orchestration via predictive optimization
