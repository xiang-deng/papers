This paper studies the task of best counter-argument retrieval given an input argument. Following the definition that the best counter-argument addresses the same aspects as the input argument while having the opposite stance, we aim to develop an efficient and effective model for scoring counter-arguments based on similarity and dissimilarity metrics. We first conduct an experimental study on the effectiveness of available scoring methods, including traditional Learning-To-Rank …
