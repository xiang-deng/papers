With the advent of the big data era and the timeliness requirements of data processing, a large amount of streaming industrial big data is continuously obtained in real time. Facing this kind of flowing and time-varying knowledge information form, incremental learning is necessary. Lifelong learning (LL), as a typical incremental learning method, can continuously retain and accumulate old knowledge while learning new knowledge, which is very suitable for streaming industrial big data Cites: Never-ending learning
