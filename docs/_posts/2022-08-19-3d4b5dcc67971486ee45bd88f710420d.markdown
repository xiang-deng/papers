Graph representations of programs are commonly a central element of machine learning for code research. We introduce an open source Python library python_graphs that applies static analysis to construct graph representations of Python programs suitable for training machine learning models. Our library admits the construction of control-flow graphs, data-flow graphs, and composite``program graphs that combine control-flow, data-flow, syntactic, and lexical information about a Cites: Dawn Drain, Neel Sundaresan, Jian Yin, Daxin Jiang, and Ming
