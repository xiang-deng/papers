Modern smartwatches or wrist wearables having multiple physiological sensing modalities have emerged as a subtle way to detect different mental health conditions, such as anxiety, emotions, and stress. However, affect detection models depending on wrist sensors data often provide poor performance due to inconsistent or inaccurate signals and scarcity of labeled data representing a condition. Although learning representations based on the physiological similarities of the affective tasks  Cites: BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
