In this manuscript, we review the work we undertake to build a large-scale benchmark dataset for an understudied Information Retrieval task called Semantic Query Labeling. This task is particularly relevant for search tasks that involve structured documents, such as Vertical Search, and consists of automatically recognizing the parts that compose a query and unfolding the relations between the query terms and the documents  fields. We first motivate the importance of building Cites: WikiQA: A challenge dataset for open-domain question answering
