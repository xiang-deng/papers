Railways are essential for freight transport due to their operational reliability advantages, but maintaining this advantage requires optimised railway infrastructure. Previous research has developed models to predict freight rail disruptions/disturbances and their associated delay times, in order to better understand the impact of multiple factors on them. However, because these models are built on static datasets, extracting real value from a model in a production environment remains …
