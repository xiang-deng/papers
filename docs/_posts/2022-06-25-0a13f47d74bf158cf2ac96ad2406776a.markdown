ABSTRACT We introduce the Idea Machine, a creativity support tool that leverages large language models (LLMs) to empower people engaged in idea generation tasks. The tool includes a number of affordances that can be used to enable various levels of automation and intelligent support. Each idea entered into the system can be expanded, rewritten, or combined with other ideas or concepts. An idea suggestion mode can also be enabled to make the system proactively suggest ideas.
