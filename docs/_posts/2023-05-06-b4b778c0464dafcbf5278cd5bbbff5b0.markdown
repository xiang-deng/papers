Large language models (LMs) beyond a certain scale, demonstrate the emergent capability of generating free-text rationales for their predictions via chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. While CoT can yield dramatically improved performance, such gains are only observed for sufficiently large LMs. Even more concerning, there is little guarantee that the generated rationales are consistent with LM s predictions or faithfully justify the decisions. In this work, we propose a faithful knowledge  Cites: Reframing human-AI collaboration for generating free-text
