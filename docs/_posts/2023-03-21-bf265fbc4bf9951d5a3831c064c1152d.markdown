ABSTRACT As Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)-based dense retrieval becomes ubiquitous for search and recommendation scenarios, efficiently answering filtered ANNS queries has become a critical requirement. Filtered ANNS queries ask for the nearest neighbors of a query s embedding from the points in the index that match the query s labels such as date, price range, language. There has been little prior work on algorithms that use label metadata associated with vector  Cites: Neighbor-sensitive hashing
