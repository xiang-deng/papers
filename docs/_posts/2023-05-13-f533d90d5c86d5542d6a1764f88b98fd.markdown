Unsupervised opinion summarization is the technique of automatically generates summaries without gold reference, and the summaries that reflects aspects of information about the entity. Although there are more mature studies on unsupervised opinion summarazaiton, but these studies focus more on unsupervised training methods and ignore the extraction of information by the model. In this paper, we propose JointSum, an unsupervised opinion summarization method based on  Cites: Unsupervised opinion summarization with content planning
