Automated task planning algorithms have been developed to help robots complete complex tasks that require multiple actions. Most of those algorithms have been developed for closed worlds assuming complete world knowledge is provided. However, the real world is generally open, and the robots frequently encounter unforeseen situations that can potentially break the planner s completeness. This paper introduces a novel algorithm (COWP) for open-world task planning and  Cites: Opt: Open pre-trained transformer language models
