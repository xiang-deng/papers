Automated decision-making systems become increasingly powerful due to higher model complexity. While powerful in prediction accuracy, Deep Learning models are black boxes by nature, preventing users from making informed judgments about the correctness and fairness of such an automated system. Explanations have been proposed as a general remedy to the black box problem. However, it remains unclear if effects of explanations on user trust generalise over varying accuracy Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
