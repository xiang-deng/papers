Expert finding is crucial for a wealth of applications in both academia and industry. Given a user query and trove of academic papers, expert finding aims to retrieve the most relevant experts for the query, from the academic papers. Existing studies focus on embedding-based solutions that consider academic papers textual semantic similarities to a query via document representation and extract the top-n experts from the most similar papers.
