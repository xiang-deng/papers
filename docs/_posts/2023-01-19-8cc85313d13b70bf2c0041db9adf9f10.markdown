Word suggestion in unsupervised sentence simplification aims to replace complex words of a given sentence with their simpler alternatives. This is mostly done without considering their context within the input sentence. In this paper, we propose a technique that brings context awareness to word suggestion by merging pre-trained BERT models with a successful edit-based unsupervised sentence simplification model. More importantly, we show that only by fine-tuning the BERT model on simple …
