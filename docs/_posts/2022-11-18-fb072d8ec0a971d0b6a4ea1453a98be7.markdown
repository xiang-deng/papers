While advances in pre-training have led to dramatic improvements in few-shot learning of NLP tasks, there is limited understanding of what drives successful few-shot adaptation in datasets. In particular, given a new dataset and a pre-trained model, what properties of the dataset make it\emph {few-shot learnable} and are these properties independent of the specific adaptation techniques used? We consider an extensive set of recent few-shot learning methods, and show that their  Cites: Cutting down on prompts and parameters: Simple few-shot
