Reinforcement learning is a promising method for robotic grasping as it can learn effective reaching and grasping policies in difficult scenarios. However, achieving human-like manipulation capabilities with sophisticated robotic hands is challenging because of the problem s high dimensionality. Although remedies such as reward shaping or expert demonstrations can be employed to overcome this issue, they often lead to oversimplified and biased policies. We present Dext-Gen, a …
