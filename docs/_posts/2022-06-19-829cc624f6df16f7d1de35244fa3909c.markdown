Learning program semantics from raw source code is challenging due to the complexity of real-world programming language syntax and due to the difficulty of reconstructing long-distance relational information implicitly represented in programs using identifiers. Addressing the first point, we consider Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) as a standard representation of program verification problems, providing a simple and programming language-independent syntax. For the second challenge  Cites: Lambdanet: Probabilistic type inference using graph neural networks
