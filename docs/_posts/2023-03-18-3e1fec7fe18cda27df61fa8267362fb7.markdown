Few-shot relation classification is a natural language processing task that aims to enable models to recognize new relational categories of query instances by training on base classes with few labeled support instances. Many recently proposed prototypical-network-based approaches have exhibited excellent performance, some of which include additional information to further improve the model performance further. However, existing methods ignore the category information hidden in the  Cites: Open Hierarchical Relation Extraction
