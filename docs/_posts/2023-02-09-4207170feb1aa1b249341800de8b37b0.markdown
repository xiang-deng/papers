Knowledge graphs represent known facts using triplets. While existing knowledge graph embedding methods only consider the connections between entities, we propose considering the relationships between triplets. For example, let us consider two triplets $ T_1 $ and $ T_2 $ where $ T_1 $ is (Academy_Awards, Nominates, Avatar) and $ T_2 $ is (Avatar, Wins, Academy_Awards). Given these two base-level triplets, we see that $ T_1 $ is a prerequisite for $ T_2 $. In this paper, we define a  Cites: Lifted rule injection for relation embeddings
