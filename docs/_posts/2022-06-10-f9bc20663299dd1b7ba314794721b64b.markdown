We tackle a new task, event graph completion, which aims to predict missing event nodes for event graphs. Existing link prediction or graph completion methods have difficulty dealing with event graphs because they are usually designed for a single large graph such as a social network or a knowledge graph, rather than multiple small dynamic event graphs. Moreover, they can only predict missing edges rather than missing nodes. In this work, we propose to utilize event schema, a template that …
