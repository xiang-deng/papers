Named entity recognition (NER) in a few-shot setting is an extremely challenging task, and most existing methods fail to account for the gap between NER tasks and pre-trained language models. Although prompt learning has been successfully applied in few-shot classification tasks, adapting to token-level classification similar to the NER task presents challenges in terms of time consumption and efficiency. In this work, we propose a decomposed prompt learning NER framework for few-shot Cites: Noisy channel language model prompting for few-shot text
