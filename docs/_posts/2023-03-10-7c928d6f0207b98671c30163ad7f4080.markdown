Menu system design is a challenging task involving many design options and various human factors. For example, one crucial factor that designers need to consider is the semantic and systematic relation of menu commands. However, capturing these relations can be challenging due to limited available resources. With the advancement of neural language models, large language models can utilize their vast pre-existing knowledge in designing and refining menu systems.
