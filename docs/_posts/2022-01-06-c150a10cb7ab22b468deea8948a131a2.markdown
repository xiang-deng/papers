Computer vision (CV) approaches applied to digital pathology have informed biological discovery and clinical decision-making. However, batch effects in images represent a major challenge to effective analysis. A CV model trained using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) risks learning batch-effects when they may align with the labels and serve as spurious correlates. The standard methods to circumvent learning such confounders include (i) application of image augmentation Cites: Selective classification can magnify disparities across groups
