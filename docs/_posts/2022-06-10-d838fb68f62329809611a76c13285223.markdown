We study the ability of language models to translate natural language into formal specifications with complex semantics. In particular, we fine-tune off-the-shelf language models on three datasets consisting of structured English sentences and their corresponding formal representation: 1) First-order logic (FOL), commonly used in software verification and theorem proving; 2) linear-time temporal logic (LTL), which forms the basis for industrial hardware specification languages; and 3) regular …
