In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of In-Context Learning (ICL) by addressing several open questions:(a) What type of ICL estimator is learned within language models?(b) What are suitable performance metrics to evaluate ICL accurately and what are the error rates?(c) How does the transformer architecture enable ICL? To answer (a), we take a Bayesian view and demonstrate that ICL implicitly implements the Bayesian model averaging algorithm.
