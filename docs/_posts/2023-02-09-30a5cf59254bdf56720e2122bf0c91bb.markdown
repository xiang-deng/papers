Graph neural networks are prominent models for representation learning over graph-structured data. While the capabilities and limitations of these models are well-understood for simple graphs, our understanding remains highly incomplete in the context of knowledge graphs. The goal of this work is to provide a systematic understanding of the landscape of graph neural networks for knowledge graphs pertaining the prominent task of link prediction. Our analysis entails a unifying Cites: Observed Versus Latent Features for Knowledge Base and Text
