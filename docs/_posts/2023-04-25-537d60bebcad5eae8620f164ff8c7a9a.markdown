Asymmetrical multiplayer (AMP) game is a popular game genre which involves multiple types of agents competing or collaborating with each other in the game. It is difficult to train powerful agents that can defeat top human players in AMP games by typical self-play training method because of unbalancing characteristics in their asymmetrical environments. We propose asymmetric-evolution training (AET), a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that can train multiple kinds of Cites: Keeping your distance: Solving sparse reward tasks using self
