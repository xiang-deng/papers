Question answering (QA) models have shown compelling results in the task of Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). Recently these systems have proved to perform better than humans on held-out test sets of datasets eg SQuAD, but their robustness is not guaranteed. The QA model s brittleness is exposed when evaluated on adversarial generated examples by a performance drop. In this study, we explore the robustness of MRC models to entity renaming, with entities from low Cites: MultiQA: An Empirical Investigation of Generalization and Transfer
