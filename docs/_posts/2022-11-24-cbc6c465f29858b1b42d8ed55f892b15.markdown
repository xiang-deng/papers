As an important application scenario of deep learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is receiving more and more attention and developing rapidly. Learning representation for words or documents via neural networks is gradually replacing feature engineering in almost all text-related applications. On the other hand, how to decode these representations or encodings is also very vital for sequence-to-sequence text generation tasks such as Neural Abstractive Summarization (NAS) …
