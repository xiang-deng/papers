For hypergraph clustering, various methods have been proposed to define hypergraph p-Laplacians in the literature. This work proposes a general framework for an abstract class of hypergraph p-Laplacians from a differential-geometric view. This class includes previously proposed hypergraph p-Laplacians and also includes previously unstudied novel generalizations. For this abstract class, we extend current spectral theory by providing an extension of nodal domain theory for the Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
