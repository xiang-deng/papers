However, in an environment with a huge volume of unannotated texts (eg a hospital) and a low frequency of positives (eg a mention of a particular disease in the clinical notes) the task becomes very inefficient. This paper presents a framework to tackle this problem: given an existing NER/NEL system, we propose a technique consisting of using text similarity search to rank texts …
