Reinforcement learning has recently been recognized as a promising means of machine learning, but its applicability remains limited in real-time environment due to its short response time, high computational complexity, and instability in learning. Although researchers devised several measures in attempts to press beyond the horizon, the problems consisting of large branching factors with real-time properties still stays unconquered, demanding a new method for reinforcement learning as a Cites: Opponent modeling in deep reinforcement learning
