Question answering requiring discrete reasoning, eg, arithmetic computing, comparison, and counting, over knowledge is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose UniRPG, a semantic-parsing-based approach advanced in interpretability and scalability, to perform unified discrete reasoning over heterogeneous knowledge resources, ie, table and text, as program generation. Concretely, UniRPG consists of a neural programmer and a symbolic program executor, where a program is the …
