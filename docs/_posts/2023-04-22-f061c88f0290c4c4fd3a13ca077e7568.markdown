Aiming at mining high quality topics by accumulating and utilizing semantic knowledge for a stream of documents, lifelong topic modeling (LTM) has attracted more and more attentions recently. However, the permutation of topics may change over time, resulting in a semantic misalignment between the topic representations of document chunks across the stream. Such a misalignment deteriorates the model performances of various downstream tasks, while it has been overlooked by the  Cites: Continual Relation Learning via Episodic Memory Activation and
