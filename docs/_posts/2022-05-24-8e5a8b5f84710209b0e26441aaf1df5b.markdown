Predictions are often probabilities; eg, a prediction could be for precipitation tomorrow, but with only a 30% chance. Given such probabilistic predictions together with the actual outcomes,  reliability diagrams  help detect and diagnose statistically significant discrepancies--so-called  miscalibration --between the predictions and the outcomes. The canonical reliability diagrams histogram the observed and expected values of the predictions; replacing the hard histogram binning with soft … Cites: ‪Verified uncertainty calibration‬
