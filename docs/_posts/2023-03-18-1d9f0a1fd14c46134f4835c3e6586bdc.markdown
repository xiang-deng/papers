Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various tasks. However, whether they are competitive few-shot solvers for information extraction (IE) tasks and surpass fine-tuned small Pre-trained Language Models (SLMs) remains an open problem. This paper aims to provide a thorough answer to this problem, and moreover, to explore an approach towards effective and economical IE systems that combine the strengths of LLMs and SLMs. Through extensive …
