Abstract Conventional Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods typically map entities and relations to a unified space through the shared mapping matrix, and then interact with entities and relations to infer the missing items in the knowledge graph. Although this shared mapping matrix considers the suitability of all triplets, it neglects the specificity of each triplet. To solve this problem, we dynamically learn one information distributor for each triplet to exchange its specific information. In this …
