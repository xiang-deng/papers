Both artificial intelligence (AI) and domain knowledge from human experts play an important role in manufacturing decision-making. While smart manufacturing emphasizes a fully automated data-driven decision-making, the AI incubation process involves human experts to enhance AI systems by integrating domain knowledge for modeling, data collection and annotation, and feature extraction. Such an AI incubation process will not only enhance the domain knowledge discovery, but Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
