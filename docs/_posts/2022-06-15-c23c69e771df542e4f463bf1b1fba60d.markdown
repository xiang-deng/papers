Abstract Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is a technique for embedding entities and relations of knowledge graphs (KGs) into continuous vector spaces while maintaining the inherent structure of KGs, in this way link prediction can be facilitated by scoring candidate triples. Existing KGE models only capture specific features of a KG, however, link prediction capacity heavily relies on comprehensive features of a KG. In this work, we propose an ensemble approach for KGE by incorporating the …
