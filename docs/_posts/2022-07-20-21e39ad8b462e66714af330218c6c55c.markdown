Real-life programs contain multiple operations whose semantics are unavailable to verification engines, like third-party library calls, inline assembly and SIMD instructions, special compiler-provided primitives, and queries to uninterpretable machine learning models. Even with the exceptional success story of program verification, synthesis of inductive invariants for such open programs has remained a challenge. Currently, this problem is handled by manually closing the program Cites: Learning invariants using decision trees and implication
