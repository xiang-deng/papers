The symptom checking systems inquire users for their symptoms and perform a rapid and affordable medical assessment of their condition. The basic symptom checking systems based on Bayesian methods, decision trees, or information gain methods are easy to train and do not require significant computational resources. However, their drawbacks are low relevance of proposed symptoms and insufficient quality of diagnostics. The best results on these tasks are achieved by reinforcement learning …
