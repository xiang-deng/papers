Recent NLP literature has seen growing interest in improving model interpretability. Along this direction, we propose a trainable neural network layer that learns a global interaction graph between words and then selects more informative words using the learned word interactions. Our layer, we call WIGRAPH, can plug into any neural network-based NLP text classifiers right after its word embedding layer. Across multiple SOTA NLP models and various NLP datasets, we demonstrate that adding Cites: Learning question classifiers
