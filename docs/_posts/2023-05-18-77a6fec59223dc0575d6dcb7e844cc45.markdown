Neural network-based techniques for automated program repair are becoming increasingly effective. Despite their success, little is known about why they succeed or fail, and how their way of reasoning about the code to repair compares to human developers. This paper presents the first in-depth study comparing human and neural program repair. In particular, we investigate what parts of the buggy code humans and two state of the art neural repair models focus on. This comparison is …
