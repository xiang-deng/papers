A recent line of work in NLP focuses on the (dis) ability of models to generalise compositionally for artificial languages. However, when considering natural language tasks, the data involved is not strictly, or locally, compositional. Quantifying the compositionality of data is a challenging task, which has been investigated primarily for short utterances. We use recursive neural models (Tree-LSTMs) with bottlenecks that limit the transfer of information between nodes. We illustrate that …
