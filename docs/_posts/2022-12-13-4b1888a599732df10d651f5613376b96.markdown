Event Detection, which aims to identify and classify mentions of event instances from unstructured articles, is an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Existing techniques for event detection only use homogeneous one-hot vectors to represent the event type classes, ignoring the fact that the semantic meaning of the types is important to the task. Such an approach is inefficient and prone to overfitting. In this paper, we propose S emantic P ivoting Model for E ffective E vent D etection  Cites: Entity, relation, and event extraction with contextualized span
