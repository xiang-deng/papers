Executing code is essential for various program analysis tasks, eg, to detect bugs that manifest through exceptions or to obtain execution traces for further dynamic analysis. However, executing an arbitrary piece of code is often difficult in practice, eg, because of missing variable definitions, missing user inputs, and missing third-party dependencies. This paper presents LExecutor, a learning-guided approach for executing arbitrary code snippets in an underconstrained way. The key idea is to let  Cites: VarCLR: Variable Semantic Representation Pre-training via
