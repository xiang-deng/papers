Semantic role labeling (SRL) represents the meaning of a sentence in the form of predicate-argument structures. Such shallow semantic analysis is helpful in a wide range of downstream NLP tasks and real-world applications. As treebanks enabled the development of powerful syntactic parsers, high-quality training data in the form of propbanks is crucial to build models for accurate predicate-argument analysis. Unfortunately, most languages simply do not have corresponding propbanks due to Cites: Unsupervised label-aware event trigger and argument classification
