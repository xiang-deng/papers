Understanding the relations between entities denoted by NPs in text is a critical part of human-like natural language understanding. However, only a fraction of such relations is covered by NLP tasks and models nowadays. In this work, we establish the task of text-based NP enrichment (TNE), that is, enriching each NP with all the preposition-mediated relations that hold between this and the other NPs in the text. The relations are represented as triplets, each denoting two NPs linked via a Cites: Decontextualization: Making Sentences Stand-Alone
