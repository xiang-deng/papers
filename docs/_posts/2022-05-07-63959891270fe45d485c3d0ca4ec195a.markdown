Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of polyhydroxylated plant steroid hormones with similar structures to animals  steroid hormones that are crucial for many aspects of a plant s life. Their characteristic feature is their resemblance to plant sterols like sitosterol and campesterol. BR was recognized as a regulator of transcription and translation thereby changing the expression pattern of total proteins, enzymes, and photosynthetic rate, and finally the seed yield, at harvest. Physiologically they have Cites: BRL1 and BRL3 are novel brassinosteroid receptors that function
