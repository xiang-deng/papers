Because of its high dimensionality, complex dynamics and irregularity, forecasting of time series data has been studied by both statistics and machine learning community for decades. The massive and ever-growing volume of data created by modern applications poses even more serious challenges to practical forecasting tools.(1) Scalability. Modern forecasters should be able to process large amount of diverse time series effectively and efficiently.(2) Correlation Awareness.
