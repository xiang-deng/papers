Estimates of individual treatment effects from networked observational data are attracting increasing attention these days. One major challenge in network scenarios is the violation of the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA), which assumes that the treatment assignment of a unit does not influence others outcomes. In network data, due to interference, the outcome of a unit is influenced not only by its treatment (ie, direct effects) but also by others treatments (ie, spillover effects)  Cites: Recommender systems with social regularization
