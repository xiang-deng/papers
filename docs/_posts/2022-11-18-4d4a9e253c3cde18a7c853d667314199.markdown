Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing the world, affecting almost every field of science and industry. Recent algorithms (in particular, deep networks) are increasingly data-hungry, requiring large datasets for training. Thus, the dominant paradigm in ML today involves constructing large, task-specific datasets. However, obtaining quality datasets of such magnitude proves to be a difficult challenge. A variety of methods have been proposed to address this data bottleneck problem, but  Cites: Incidental supervision: Moving beyond supervised learning
