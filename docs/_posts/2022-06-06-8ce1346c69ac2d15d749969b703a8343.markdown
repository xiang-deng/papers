To accelerate the training of graph convolutional networks (GCNs), many sampling-based methods have been developed for approximating the embedding aggregation. Among them, a layer-wise approach recursively performs importance sampling to select neighbors jointly for existing nodes in each layer. This paper revisits the approach from a matrix approximation perspective. We identify two issues in the existing layer-wise sampling methods: sub-optimal sampling probabilities and  Cites: Memory augmented policy optimization for program synthesis and
