Despite recent breakthroughs in Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing, the Natural Language Inference (NLI) problems still constitute a challenge. To this purpose we contribute a new dataset that focuses exclusively on the factivity phenomenon; however, our task remains the same as other NLI tasks, ie prediction of entailment, contradiction or neutral (ECN). The dataset contains entirely natural language utterances in Polish and gathers 2,432 verb-complement pairs and Cites: Distributionally robust language modeling
