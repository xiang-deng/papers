Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has suggested many effective solutions to complex problems. Despite the impressive achievements of DRL, we have limited insights into why DRL is effective. DRL is also known as a black-box model with high complexity which makes DRL difficult to interpret in a human-understandable way to discover the rationale behind DRL s predictions. Many papers have proposed different techniques intended to improve interpretability and measured the effect of Cites:   Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
