The high uncertainty of renewables introduces more dynamics to power systems. The conventional way of monitoring and controlling power systems is no longer reliable. New strategies are needed to ensure the stability and reliability of power systems. This work aims to assess the use of machine learning methods in analyzing data from renewable integrated power systems to aid the decision making of electricity market participants. Specifically, the work studies the cases of electricity Cites: An investigation of why overparameterization exacerbates
