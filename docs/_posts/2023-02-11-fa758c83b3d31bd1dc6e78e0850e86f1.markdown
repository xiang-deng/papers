In real-world scenarios, knowledge graphs remain incomplete and contain abnormal information, such as redundan-cies, contradictions, inconsistencies, misspellings, and abnormal values. These shortcomings in the knowledge graphs potentially affect service quality in many applications. Although many approaches are proposed to perform knowledge graph completion, they are incapable of handling the abnormal information of knowledge graphs. Therefore, to address the abnormal information Cites: Never-ending learning
