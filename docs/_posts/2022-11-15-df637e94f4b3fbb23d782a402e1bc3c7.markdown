The ever-increasing demand for novel materials with superior properties inspires retrofitting traditional research paradigms in the era of artificial intelligence and automation. An autonomous experimental platform (AEP) has emerged as an exciting research frontier that achieves full autonomy via integrating data-driven algorithms such as machine learning (ML) with experimental automation in the material development loop from synthesis, characterization, and analysis, to decision  Cites: EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural
