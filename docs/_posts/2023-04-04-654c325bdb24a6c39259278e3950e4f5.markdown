Recently, the study of linear misspecified bandits has generated intriguing implications of the hardness of learning in bandits and reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, Du et al.(2020) show that even if a learner is given linear features in $\mathbb {R}^ d $ that approximate the rewards in a bandit or RL with a uniform error of $\varepsilon $, searching for an $ O (\varepsilon) $-optimal action requires pulling at least $\Omega (\exp (d)) $ queries. Furthermore, Lattimore et al.(2020) show that a  Cites: Provably optimal algorithms for generalized linear contextual bandits
