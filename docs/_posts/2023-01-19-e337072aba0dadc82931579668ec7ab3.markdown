Recent research apply KG embedding to multi-hop Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) to predict missing links, however, it is often affected by the skewed distribution of nodes in the knowledge graph, resulting in poor generalization of the model. Therefore, we propose a method TrEKBQA based on traversing the knowledge graph embedding space for multi-hop KBQA, which performs path traversal in the KG embedding space instead of KG itself for link  Cites: Semantic Parsing via Staged Query Graph Generation: Question
