Data collected from nature is usually unlabeled, and it is difficult to be used directly. This issue is well addressed by crowdsourcing, which provides a reasonable way for effectively using these unlabeled data. Generally, workers in crowdsourcing tasks are not professionals, so it is hard to obtain high-quality labels. To address this issue, a robust sparse weighted classification algorithm is proposed, which try to adjust the samples that are not correctly classified in the original lables as much as possible  Cites: Spectral methods meet EM: A provably optimal algorithm for
