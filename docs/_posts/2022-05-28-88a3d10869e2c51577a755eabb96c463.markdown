Automated scoring of open-ended student responses has the potential to significantly reduce human grader effort. Recent advances in automated scoring often leverage textual representations based on pre-trained language models such as BERT and GPT as input to scoring models. Most existing approaches train a separate model for each item/question, which is suitable for scenarios such as essay scoring where items can be quite different from one another. However, these … Cites: ‪Metaicl: Learning to learn in context‬
