Catching and attributing code change-induced performance regressions in production is hard; predicting them beforehand, even harder. A primer on automatically learning to predict performance regressions in software, this article gives an account of the experiences we gained when researching and deploying an ML-based regression prediction pipeline at Meta. In this paper, we report on a comparative study with four ML models of increasing complexity, from (1) code Cites: What does BERT look at? An analysis of BERT s attention
