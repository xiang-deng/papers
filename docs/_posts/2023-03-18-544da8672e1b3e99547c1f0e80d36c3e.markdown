Distribution shift has been a longstanding challenge for the reliable deployment of deep learning (DL) models due to unexpected accuracy degradation. Although DL has been becoming a driving force for large-scale source code analysis in the big code era, limited progress has been made on distribution shift analysis and benchmarking for source code tasks. To fill this gap, this paper initiates to propose CodeS, a distribution shift benchmark dataset, for source code learning. Specifically  Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
