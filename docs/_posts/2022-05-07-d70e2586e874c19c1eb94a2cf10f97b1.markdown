In knowledge base question answering, complex question always has long-distance dependencies, especially aggregate question, which affects query graph matching. Many previous approaches have made conspicuous progress in complex question answering. However, they mostly only compare based on the textual similarity of the predicate sequences, ignoring the degree of semantic information either questions or query graphs. In this paper, we propose a Graph-level Semantic Matching (GSM) Cites: Semantic Parsing via Staged Query Graph Generation: Question
