In recent years, community structure has become a research hotspot in complex networks, and there are currently many excellent methods in the field of community detection, such as label propagation algorithms, LFM community detection algorithms, etc. These algorithms primarily investigate undirected networks, but the linking relationships between nodes in real complex networks are mostly directed and asymmetric, such as social networks. Therefore it is imperative to perform  Cites: Semi-supervised Learning on Directed Graphs.
