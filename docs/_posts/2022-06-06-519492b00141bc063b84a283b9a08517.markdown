Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a well-known optimization algorithm that shows good performance in solving different optimization problems. However, PSO usually suffers from slow convergence. In this article, a reinforcement learning-based online parameters adaption method (RLAM) is developed to enhance PSO in convergence by designing a network to control the coefficients of PSO. Moreover, based on RLAM, a new RLPSO is designed. In order to investigate the performance of RLAM and …
