Based on the principle of locality, the current Cache hit rate has reached a high level. At the same time, its replacement algorithm has also encountered a bottleneck. The current algorithms show poor results on large-scale datasets. In this paper, machine learning technology is applied to the hit strategy of Cache. The calculation task is converted into a DAG graph, and then the DAG graph is represented by an adjacency matrix, and the multiple linear regression model is input to predict the Cites: Challenges and opportunities with Big Data 2011-1
