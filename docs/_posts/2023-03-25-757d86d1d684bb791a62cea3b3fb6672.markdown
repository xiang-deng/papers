Artificial intelligence (AI) and human-machine interaction (HMI) are two keywords that usually do not fit embedded applications. Within the steps needed before applying AI to solve a specific task, HMI is usually missing during the AI architecture design and the training of an AI model. The human-in-the-loop concept is prevalent in all other steps of developing AI, from data analysis via data selection and cleaning to performance evaluation. During AI architecture design, HMI can immediately …
