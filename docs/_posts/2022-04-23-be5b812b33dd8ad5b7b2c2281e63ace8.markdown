Deep learning based image reconstruction methods outperform traditional methods in accuracy and runtime. However, neural networks suffer from a performance drop when applied to images from a different distribution than the training images. For example, a model trained for reconstructing knees in accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not reconstruct brains well, even though the same network trained on brains reconstructs brains perfectly well. Thus there is a Cites: Accuracy on the line: on the strong correlation between out-of
