The state-of-the-art in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for computer vision excels in performance, while remaining opaque. But due to safety regulations for safety-critical applications, like perception for automated driving, the choice of model should also take into account how candidate models represent semantic information for model transparency reasons. To tackle this yet unsolved problem, our work proposes two methods for quantifying the similarity between semantic information in  Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
