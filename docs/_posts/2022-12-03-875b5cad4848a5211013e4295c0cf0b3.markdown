The purpose of this study is to present an exhaustive analysis on research paper recommender systems which have become very popular and gained a lot of research attention. Though the major focus is on developing new recommendation algorithms, other research dimensions are left untouched. Renown recommendation classes include content-based approaches, collaborative filtering, link-based algorithms, co-occurrence based approaches, global relevance and hybrid methods Cites: Evaluating pretrained transformer models for citation
