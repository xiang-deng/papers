Since 2012, the field of Machine Learning (ML) has enjoyed exponential growth in applications as well as theory partly due to the advances in computing and big data. As more and more people get interested in machine learning, the application space has been expanding from classical areas within ML (eg image classification, natural language processing (NLP), robotics, etc.) to biology (eg protein folding, disease detection), astrophysics (eg detecting new exoplanets) and many more.
