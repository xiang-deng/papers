In this paper, we conduct a measurement study to comprehensively compare the accuracy of Cryptographic API completion tasks trained with multiple API embedding options. Embedding is the process of automatically learning to represent program elements as low-dimensional vectors. Our measurement aims to uncover the impacts of applying program analysis, token-level embedding, and sequence-level embedding on the Cryptographic API completion accuracies. Our findings show that …
