Recently, neural network-based approaches have pushed the performance of both extractive and abstractive text summarization models to new heights. Despite these advances, the black-box nature of neural network based text summarization models makes them hard to interpret and control. We cannot force a model to include or exclude certain pieces of information, nor can we even guarantee that everything it includes is factual.
