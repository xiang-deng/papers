Building advanced machine learning (ML) models requires expert knowledge and many trials to discover the best architecture and hyperparameter settings. Previous work demonstrates that model information can be leveraged to assist other attacks, such as membership inference, generating adversarial examples. Therefore, such information, eg, hyperparameters, should be kept confidential. It is well known that an adversary can leverage a target ML model s output to steal the model s information  Cites: Thieves on Sesame Street! Model Extraction of BERT-based APIs
