Learning-based algorithms to solve TSP are getting popular in recent years, but most existing works cannot solve very large-scale TSP instances within a limited time. To solve this problem, this paper introduces a creative and distinctive method to select and locally optimize sub-parts of a solution. Concretely, we design a novel framework to generalize a small-scale selector-and-optimizer network to large-scale TSP instances by iteratively selecting while optimizing one sub-problem.
