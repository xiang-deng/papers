Markov chains are a class of probabilistic models that have achieved widespread application in the quantitative sciences. This is in part due to their versatility, but is compounded by the ease with which they can be probed analytically. This tutorial provides an in-depth introduction to Markov chains, and explores their connection to graphs and random walks. We utilize tools from linear algebra and graph theory to describe the transition matrices of different types of Markov chains, with a particular Cites: Learning from labeled and unlabeled data on a directed graph
