Remarkable methane uptake is demonstrated experimentally in three metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) identified by computational screening: UTSA76, UMCM152 and DUT23Cu. These MOFs outperform the benchmark sorbent, HKUST1, both volumetrically and gravimetrically, under a pressure swing of 80 to 5 bar at 298 K. Although high uptake at elevated pressure is critical for achieving this performance, a low density of highaffinity sites (coordinatively unsaturated metal centers) also Cites: Theoretical limits of hydrogen storage in metalorganic
