This paper presents a workflow for the design of transformation processes using different kinds of expert s knowledge. It introduces POND (Process and observation ONtology Discovery), a workflow dedicated to answer expert s questions about processes. It addresses two main issues:(1) how to represent the processes inner complexity, and (2) how to reason about processes taking into account uncertainty and causality. First, we show how to use a semantic model, an ontology, and its Cites: Introduction to statistical relational learning
