Learning feature interactions is crucial to success for large-scale CTR prediction in recommender systems and Ads ranking. Researchers and practitioners extensively proposed various neural network architectures for searching and modeling feature interactions. However, we observe that different datasets favor different neural network architectures and feature interaction types, suggesting that different feature interaction learning methods may have their own unique advantages.
