Modelling the characteristics and composition of coal is important, as proximity data and other measurements to do so are typically expensive or hard to acquire in real-time. Understanding anomalies in these relatively small data sets are important, as removal may result in an unnecessary loss of data or bias in the data used in the model. Although anomaly detection has been considered in-depth in the literature, very little work has been devoted to the explanation of anomalies.
