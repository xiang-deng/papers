Abstract Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion (FKGC) has recently attracted significant research interest due to its ability to expand few-shot relation coverage in Knowledge Graphs. Prevailing FKGC approaches focus on exploiting the one-hop neighbor information of entities to enhance few-shot relation embedding. However, these methods select one-hop neighbors randomly and neglect the rich multi-aspect information of entities. Although some methods have attempted to leverage Long  Cites: Giving BERT a Calculator: Finding Operations and Arguments with
