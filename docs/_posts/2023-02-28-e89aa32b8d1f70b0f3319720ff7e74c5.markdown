Current research on knowledge graph construction is focused chiefly on general-purpose fields, whereas constructing knowledge graphs in vertically segmented professional fields faces numerous difficulties. To solve the problems of complex relation types of domain entities, the lack of a large amount of annotated corpus, and the difficulty of extraction, this study proposed a method for constructing domain-annotated datasets based on publicly available texts on the web, which integrates …
