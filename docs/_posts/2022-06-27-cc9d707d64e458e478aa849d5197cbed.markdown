Automated decision-making systems are increasingly being deployed in areas with high personal and societal impact. This naturally led to growing interest in trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), encompassing many fields of research including algorithmic fairness, robustness, explainability, privacy, and more. These works share a common theme of questioning and moderating the behavior of automated tools in various real-world settings, which inherently exhibit different  Cites: On the hardness of approximate reasoning
