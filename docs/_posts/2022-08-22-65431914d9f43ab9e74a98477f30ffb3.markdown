Code completion, a highly valuable topic in the software development domain, has been increasingly promoted for use by recent advances in large language models (LLMs). To date, visible LLM-based code completion frameworks like GitHub Copilot and GPT are trained using deep learning over vast quantities of unstructured text and open source codes. As the paramount component and the cornerstone in daily programming tasks, code completion has largely boosted professionals efficiency in Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
