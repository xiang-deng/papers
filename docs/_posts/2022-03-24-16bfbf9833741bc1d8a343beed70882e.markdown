Localizing moments in a video via natural language queries is a challenging task where models are trained to identify the start and the end timestamps of the moment in a video. However, it is labor intensive to obtain the temporal endpoint annotations. In this paper, we focus on a weakly supervised setting, where the temporal endpoints of moments are not available during training. We develop a decoupled consistent concept prediction (DCCP) framework to learn the relations between videos and Cites: Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with
