Event prediction is the ability of anticipating future events, ie, future real-world occurrences, and aims to support the user in deciding on actions that change future events towards a desired state. An event prediction method learns the relation between features of past events and future events. It is applied to newly observed events to predict corresponding future events that are evaluated with respect to the user s desired future state. If the predicted future events do not comply with this state Cites: Analogous process structure induction for sub-event sequence
