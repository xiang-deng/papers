A tropical cyclone (TC) is a highly destructive natural disaster. Accurate identification of key parameters of TCs is prerequisite for most TC‐related research and practices. The center position is one of TC s basic parameters. However, comparison of TC best track data released by different meteorological institutes usually indicates a noticeable discrepancy for this parameter among varied data sources. In this study, efforts are made toward identifying the center location of TCs via deep learning …
