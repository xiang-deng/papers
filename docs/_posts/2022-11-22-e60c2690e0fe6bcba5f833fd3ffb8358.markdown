In recent years, Explainable AI (XAI) has seen increasing interest: new theoretical approaches and libraries providing computationally efficient explanation algorithms are proposed daily. Given the increasing number of algorithms, as well as the fact that there is a lack of standardized evaluation metrics, it is difficult to evaluate the goodness of explanation methods from a quantitative point of view. In this paper, we propose a benchmark of explanation methods. In particular, we focused on post-hoc  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
