We introduce the problem of Active Few-Shot Classification (AFSC) where the objective is to classify a small, initially unlabeled, dataset given a very restrained labeling budget. This problem can be seen as a rival paradigm to classical Transductive Few-Shot Classification (TFSC), as both these approaches are applicable in similar conditions. We first propose a methodology that combines statistical inference, and an original two-tier active learning strategy that fits well into …
