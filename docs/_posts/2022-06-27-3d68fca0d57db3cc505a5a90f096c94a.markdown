Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a form of Machine Learning. The goal of ILP is to induce hypotheses, as logic programs, that generalise training examples. ILP is characterised by a high expressivity, generalisation ability and interpretability. Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL) is a state-of-the-art sub-field of ILP. However, current MIL approaches have limited efficiency: the sample and learning complexity respectively are polynomial and exponential in the number of clauses. My thesis is that
