Open Information Extraction (OIE) aims to extract relational tuples from open-domain sentences. Existing OIE systems split a sentence into tokens and recognize token spans as tuple relations and arguments. We instead propose Sentence as Chunk sequence (SaC) and recognize chunk spans as tuple relations and arguments. We argue that SaC has better quantitative and qualitative properties for OIE than sentence as token sequence, and evaluate four choices of chunks (ie, CoNLL Cites: Textrunner: open information extraction on the web
