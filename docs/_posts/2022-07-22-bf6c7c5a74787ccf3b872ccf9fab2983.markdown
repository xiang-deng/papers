Many recent neural models have shown remarkable empirical results in Machine Reading Comprehension, but evidence suggests sometimes the models take advantage of dataset biases to predict and fail to generalize on out-of-sample data. While many other approaches have been proposed to address this issue from the computation perspective such as new architectures or training procedures, we believe a method that allows researchers to discover biases, and adjust the data or  Cites: MultiQA: An Empirical Investigation of Generalization and Transfer
