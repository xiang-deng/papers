The data augmentation approach is becoming very popular in Natural Language Generation (NLG). Different approaches have been utilized in NLP and NLG to augment data and increase training examples for the neural model.

We present data augmentation in DRS ie, DRS taken from the PMB corpus, for the DRS-to-Text generation task. We conducted our experiments on …
