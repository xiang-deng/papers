In order to favor carbon neutral processes for energy generation, photovoltaic cells became inevitable both in the industrial as in the domestic sector. Since the beginning of photoelectric experiments by Becquerel photovoltaic cells have been developed, which convert sunlight into electrical power and are usually made of silicon (Si). A special form of the photovoltaic cell is the Grätzel cell, which is named after its inventor Prof. Michael Grätzel. The Grätzel cell is a Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell …
