The unabated pursuit of omniscient and omnipotent AI is levying hefty latency, memory, and energy taxes at all computing scales. At the same time, the twilight of Dennard scaling means traditional performance gains are no longer proportionally attained with reduction in transistor feature size--compelling a global trend towards application-based hardware specialization. Over the course of my PhD, I have built a heterogeneity of solutions co-optimized across the algorithm, architecture, and …
