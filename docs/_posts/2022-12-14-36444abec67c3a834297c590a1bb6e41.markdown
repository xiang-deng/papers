In this article we consider certain well-known polynomials associated with graphs including the independence polynomial and the chromatic polynomial. These polynomials count certain objects in graphs: independent sets in the case of the independence polynomial and proper colourings in the case of the chro-matic polynomial. They also have interpretations as partition functions in statistical physics.  Cites: On the hardness of approximate reasoning
