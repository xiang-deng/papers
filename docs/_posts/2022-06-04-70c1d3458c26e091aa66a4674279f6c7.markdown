Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a growingly essential task in natural language understanding, which requires inferring the relationship between the sentence pairs (premise and hypothesis). Recently, low-resource natural language inference has gained increasing attention, due to significant savings in manual annotation costs and a better fit with real-world scenarios. Existing works fail to characterize discriminative representations between different classes with limited training data … Cites: ‪ERICA: Improving Entity and Relation Understanding for Pre …‬
