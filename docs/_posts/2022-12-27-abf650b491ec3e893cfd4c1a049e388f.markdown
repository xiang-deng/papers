There is high hope that corpus-based approaches to language complexity will contribute to explaining linguistic diversity. Several complexity indices have consequently been proposed to compare different aspects among languages, especially in phonology and morphology. However, their robustness against changes in corpus size and content hasn t been systematically assessed, thus impeding comparability between studies. Here, we systematically test the robustness Cites: Universal dependencies
