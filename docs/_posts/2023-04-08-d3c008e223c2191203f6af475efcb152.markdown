Graph learning can effectively characterize the similarity structure of sample pairs, hence multiple kernel clustering based on graph learning (MKC-GL) achieves promising results on nonlinear clustering tasks. However, previous methods confine to a three-stage scheme, that is, affinity graph learning, Laplacian construction, and clustering indicator extracting, which results in the information distortion in the step alternating. Meanwhile, the energy of Laplacian reconstruction and the necessary  Cites: Spectral clustering and transductive learning with multiple views
