OpenMP is a parallel computing framework that provides programmers with a set of directives and clauses to use when writing parallel applications. The most important task in adopting OpenMP is deciding the parallel pattern with associated clauses to employ in a sequential program that already exists. The shared-memory parallelization is complicated by parallel directives with different roles. Some tools have been developed to assist programmers in developing parallel programs using …
