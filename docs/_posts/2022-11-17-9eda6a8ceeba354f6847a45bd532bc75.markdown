Learning invariant representations via contrastive learning has seen state-of-the-art performance in domain generalization (DG). Despite such success, in this paper, we find that its core learning strategy--feature alignment--could heavily hinder the model generalization. Inspired by the recent progress in neuron interpretability, we characterize this problem from a neuron activation view. Specifically, by treating feature elements as neuron activation states, we show that conventional alignment …
