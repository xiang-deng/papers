Recent years have witnessed the superior performance of heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) in dealing with heterogeneous information networks (HINs). Nonetheless, the success of HGNNs often depends on the availability of sufficient labeled training data, which can be very expensive to obtain in real scenarios. Active learning provides an effective solution to tackle the data scarcity challenge. For the vast majority of the existing work regarding active learning on  Cites: Graph Policy Network for Transferable Active Learning on Graphs
