Internetbased information exchange has resulted in the propagation of false and misleading information, which is highly detrimental to individuals and humankind. Due to the speed and volume of social media news production, supervised artificial intelligence algorithms require many annotated data, which is difficult, costly, and timeconsuming. To address this issue, we offer a novel federated semisupervised framework based on selfensembling that utilizes the linguistic and stylometric Cites: A language-independent neural network for event detection
