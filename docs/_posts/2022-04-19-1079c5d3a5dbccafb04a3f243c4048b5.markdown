Dialogue State Tracking (DST) aims to keep track of users intentions during the course of a conversation. In DST, modelling the relations among domains and slots is still an under-studied problem. Existing approaches that have considered such relations generally fall short in:(1) fusing prior slot-domain membership relations and dialogue-aware dynamic slot relations explicitly, and (2) generalizing to unseen domains. To address these issues, we propose a novel textbf {D} ynamic textbf {S} Cites: Find or classify? dual strategy for slot-value predictions on multi
