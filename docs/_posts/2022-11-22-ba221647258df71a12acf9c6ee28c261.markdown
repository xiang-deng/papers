Extracting relevant user behaviors through customer s transaction description is one of the ways to collect customer information. In the current text mining field, most of the researches are mainly study text classification, and only few study text clusters. Find the relationship between letters and words in the unstructured transaction consumption description. Use Word Embedding and text mining technology to break through the limitation of classification conditions that need to be distinguished in Cites: Higher-order Coreference Resolution with Coarse-to-fine Inference
