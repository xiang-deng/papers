The curse of dimensionality refers to the problem of increased sparsity and computational complexity when dealing with high-dimensional data. In recent years, the types and variables of industrial data have increased significantly, making data-driven models more challenging to develop. To address this problem, data augmentation technology has been introduced as an effective tool to solve the sparsity problem of high-dimensional industrial data. This paper systematically …
