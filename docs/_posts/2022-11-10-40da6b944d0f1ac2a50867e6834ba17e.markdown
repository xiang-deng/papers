Event extraction is an important but challenging task. Many existing techniques decompose it into event and argument detection/classification subtasks, which are complex structured prediction problems. Generation-based extraction techniques lessen the complexity of the problem formulation and are able to leverage the reasoning capabilities of large pretrained language models. However, they still suffer from poor zero-shot generalizability and are ineffective in handling long contexts …
