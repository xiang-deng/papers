The number of texts on the Internet is large and growing. Using technical means to quickly obtain key information from massive texts and refine them into high-quality abstracts will effectively help people save time. The simple extractive abstract model based on the pre-training language model only uses Sentence-level information is extracted, ignoring the text-level text features and the correlation between texts. Therefore, an improved extractive abstract model is proposed, on the basis of the Cites: Neural summarization by extracting sentences and words
