Normalizing flows are objects used for modeling complicated probability density functions, and have attracted considerable interest in recent years. Many flexible families of normalizing flows have been developed. However, the focus to date has largely been on normalizing flows on Euclidean domains; while normalizing flows have been developed for spherical and other non-Euclidean domains, these are generally less flexible than their Euclidean counterparts. To address this …
