Objective We develop and externally validate two models for use with radiological knee osteoarthritis. They consist of a diagnostic model for KOA and a prognostic model of time to onset of KOA. Model development and optimisation used data from the Osteoarthritis initiative (OAI) and external validation for both models was by application to data from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST). Materials and methods The diagnostic model at first presentation comprises subjects in the OAI
