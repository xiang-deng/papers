In this paper, we present an overview of the NLPCC 2022 shared task on Dialogue Texts Analysis (DTA). The evaluation consists of two sub-tasks:(1) Dialogue Topic Extraction (DTE) and (2) Dialogue Summary Generation (DSG). We manually annotated a large-scale corpus for DTA, in which each dialogue contains customer and service conversation. A total of 50+ teams participated in the DTA evaluation task. We believe that DTA will push forward the research in the field of dialogue text Cites: Neural summarization by extracting sentences and words
