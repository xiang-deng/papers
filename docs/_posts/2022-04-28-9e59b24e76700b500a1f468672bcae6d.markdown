In health community forums, patients seek information, acquire knowledge and support each other. They find help by asking questions about their illness. Finding similar people with similar issues to obtain correct information is often a great challenge for them. Hence, this paper proposes a query similarity model to retrieve the similar query that is already discussed. The model is implemented with a Siamese neural network to assess the semantic similarity between the queries. The Cites: Improved semantic representations from tree-structured long short
