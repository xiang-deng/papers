Integrating functions on discrete domains into neural networks is key to developing their capability to reason about discrete objects. But, discrete domains are (1) not naturally amenable to gradient-based optimization, and (2) incompatible with deep learning architectures that rely on representations in high-dimensional vector spaces. In this work, we address both difficulties for set functions, which capture many important discrete problems. First, we develop a framework for extending set Cites: Action-depedent Control Variates for Policy Optimization via Stein s
