The study of languages  structure and their organization in a set of well-defined relation schemes is a delicate matter. In the last decades, the convergence of traditional conflicting views by linguists is supported by an interdisciplinary approach that involves not only genetics or bio-archelogy but nowadays even the science of complexity. In light of this new and useful approach, this study proposes an in-depth analysis of the complexity underlying the morphological organization, in terms of …
