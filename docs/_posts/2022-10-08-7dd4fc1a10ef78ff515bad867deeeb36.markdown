In knowledge graphs (KGs), there exist some unsolved problems such as incomplete data, hidden information with incomplete mining and so on. In the most completion models, the information of the triples in the KG is generally utilized, but the neighborhood information and rich entity description information are not included in the triples. In this paper, the knowledge graph completion (KGC) method is improved based on graph attention networks (GATs) with text information by using the Cites: Knowledge Graph Representation with Jointly Structural and
