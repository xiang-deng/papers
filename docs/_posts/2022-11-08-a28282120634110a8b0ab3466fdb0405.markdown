The sparseness and incompleteness of knowledge graphs (KGs) trigger considerable interest in enhancing the representation learning with external corpora. However, the difficulty of aligning entities and relations with external corpora leads to inferior performance improvement. Open knowledge graphs (OKGs) consist of entity-mentions and relation-mentions that are represented by noncanonicalized freeform phrases, which generally do not rely on the specification of ontology schema. The …
