This work presents BanglaNLG, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating natural language generation (NLG) models in Bangla, a widely spoken yet low-resource language in the web domain. We aggregate three challenging conditional text generation tasks under the BanglaNLG benchmark. Then, using a clean corpus of 27.5 GB of Bangla data, we pretrain BanglaT5, a sequence-to-sequence Transformer model for Bangla. BanglaT5 achieves state-of-the-art performance in all of these  Cites: Coqa: A conversational question answering challenge
