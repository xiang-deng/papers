When applied to critical domains, machine learning models usually need to comply with prior knowledge and domain-specific requirements. For example, one may require that a learned decision tree model should be of limited size and fair, so as to be easily interpretable, trusted, and adopted. However, most state-of-the-art models, even on decision trees, only aim to maximising expected accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework in which a diverse family of prior and domain knowledge can  Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
