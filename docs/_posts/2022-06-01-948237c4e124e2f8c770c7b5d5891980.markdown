Given the omnipresence of graph-structured data, graph machine learning has copious applications in multifarious fields such as social media, e-commerce platform, cyber-physical system, or chemical synthesis. Nonetheless, data driven models for graph data also face their unique challenges including over-smoothing caused by message passing-based graph neural networks, structural data sparsity brought by power-law distributions, lack of labelled data due to costly annotations  Cites: Unsupervised data augmentation for consistency training
