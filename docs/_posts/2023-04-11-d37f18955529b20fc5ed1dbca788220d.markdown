[Objective] This study aggregates the global information of knowledge graph through a weighted graph convolutional neural network and a relational induction mechanism, aiming to enhance the quality of the knowledge graph representation and completion.[Methods] We proposed an end-to-end learning model for the knowledge graph completion task, which included a neighborhood information aggregation module, an entity relationship fusion module, an interaction module, as …
