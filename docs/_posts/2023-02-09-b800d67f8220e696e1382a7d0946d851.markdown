A standard ML model is commonly generated by a single method that specifies aspects such as architecture, initialization, training data and hyperparameters configuration. The presented work introduces a novel methodology allowing to define multiple methods as distinct agents. Agents can collaborate and compete to generate and improve ML models for a given tasks. The proposed methodology is demonstrated with the generation and extension of a dynamic modular multitask ML …
