Off-policy evaluation is critical in a number of applications where new policies need to be evaluated offline before online deployment. Most existing methods focus on the expected return, define the target parameter through averaging and provide a point estimator only. In this paper, we develop a novel procedure to produce reliable interval estimators for a target policy s return starting from any initial state. Our proposal accounts for the variability of the return around its expectation, focuses on  Cites: Doubly robust bias reduction in infinite horizon off-policy estimation
