Selective classification is the task of rejecting inputs a model would predict incorrectly on through a trade-off between input space coverage and model accuracy. Current methods for selective classification impose constraints on either the model architecture or the loss function; this inhibits their usage in practice. In contrast to prior work, we show that state-of-the-art selective classification performance can be attained solely from studying the (discretized) training dynamics Cites: Selective classification can magnify disparities across groups
