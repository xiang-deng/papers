This paper presents an evaluation of the quality of automatically generated reading comprehension questions from Swedish text, using the Quinductor method. This method is a light-weight, data-driven but non-neural method for automatic question generation (QG). The evaluation shows that Quinductor is a viable QG method that can provide a strong baseline for neural-network-based QG methods.
