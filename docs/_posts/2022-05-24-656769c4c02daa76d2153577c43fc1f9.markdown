Over the last few decades, the field of base isolation systems has made significant strides forward by developing new systems to improve the behavior of isolated structures under moderate and severe seismic excitations. One of the most efficient systems is the multi-stage friction pendulum that can provide a wide range of effective pendula with various regimes to reach high energy dissipation capability. The difficulty in designing such bearing at the preliminary stage comes from the  Cites: Smooth adversarial training
