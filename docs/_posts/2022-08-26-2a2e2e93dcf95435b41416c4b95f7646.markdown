The haptic terrain classification is an essential component of a mobile walking robot control system, ensuring proper gait adaptation to the changing environmental conditions. In practice, such components are a part of an autonomous system and thus have to be lightweight, provide fast inference time, and guarantee robustness to minor changes in recorded sensory data. We propose transformer-based HAPTR and HAPTR2 terrain classification methods that use force and torque measurements Cites: Efficientnetv2: Smaller models and faster training
