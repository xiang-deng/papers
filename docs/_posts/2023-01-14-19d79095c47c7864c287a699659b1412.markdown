Text classification is one of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Its objective is to label textual elements, such as phrases, queries, paragraphs, and documents. In NLP, several approaches have achieved promising results regarding this task. Deep Learning-based approaches have been widely used in this context, with deep neural networks (DNNs) adding the ability to generate a representation for the data and a learning model. The increasing scale and complexity of DNN …
