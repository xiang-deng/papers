Most rumor detection methods extract the features of rumor through two aspects of text semantics and propagation structure to achieve automatic rumor classification, while most of the existing methods do not realize that false and irrelevant interactions in the propagation structure will reduce the accuracy of rumor detection. In addition, most of the existing rumor detection methods failed to effectively extract key clues from the comments of social network users. In response to these phenomena, this …
