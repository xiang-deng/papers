Dense retrieval models represent queries and documents with one or multiple fixed-width vectors and retrieve relevant documents via nearest neighbor search. Recently these models have shown improvement in retrieval performance and have drawn increasing attention from the IR community. Among a variety of dense retrieval models, the models that employ multiple vectors to represent texts achieve the state-of-the-art ranking performance. However, the multi-vector representation schema Cites: Sparse, dense, and attentional representations for text retrieval
