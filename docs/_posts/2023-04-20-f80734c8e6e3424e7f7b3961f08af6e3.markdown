Large Language Models (LLM) are a new class of computation engines, programmed via prompt engineering. We are still learning how to best program these LLMs to help developers. We start with the intuition that developers tend to consciously and unconsciously have a collection of semantics facts in mind when working on coding tasks. Mostly these are shallow, simple facts arising from a quick read. For a function, examples of facts might include parameter and local variable  Cites: Codexglue: A machine learning benchmark dataset for code
