Stance detection predicts attitudes towards targets in texts and has gained attention with the rise of social media. Traditional approaches include conventional machine learning, early deep neural networks, and pre-trained fine-tuning models. However, with the evolution of very large pre-trained language models (VLPLMs) like ChatGPT (GPT-3.5), traditional methods face deployment challenges. The parameter-free Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach, not requiring backpropagation training, has Cites: Emergent abilities of large language models
