Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) has made leaps and bounds when focusing on answering questions. However, since the existing accuracy-based evaluation metrics are agnostic to the nuances of neural networks, the true understanding and inferencing abilities of MRC models remain largely unknown. To address the above limitations, InDepth-Eva-MRC, an interactive and visualized platform, is proposed to provide analysis from cognitive fine-grained for MRC  Cites: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList
