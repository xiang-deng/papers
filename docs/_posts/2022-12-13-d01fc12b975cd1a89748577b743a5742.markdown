Machine learning has been widely applied to study AI-informed machinery fault diagnosis. This work proposes a sparsity-constrained invariant risk minimization (SCIRM) framework, which develops machine-learning models with better generalization capacities for environmental disturbances in machinery fault diagnosis. The SCIRM is built by innovating the optimization formulation of the recently proposed invariant risk minimization (IRM) and its variants through the …
