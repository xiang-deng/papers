We present Differentiable Neural Architectures (DNArch), a method that jointly learns the weights and the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by backpropagation. In particular, DNArch allows learning (i) the size of convolutional kernels at each layer,(ii) the number of channels at each layer,(iii) the position and values of downsampling layers, and (iv) the depth of the network. To this end, DNArch views neural architectures as continuous multidimensional entities, and Cites: Mega: moving average equipped gated attention
