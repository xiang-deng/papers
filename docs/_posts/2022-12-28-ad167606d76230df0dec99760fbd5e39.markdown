This research work presents the final report for the NEFUSI project. In fact, we present here our research findings on building neurofuzzy models that automatically evaluate semantic textual similarity in an accurate and timely manner. We show that neural networks and fuzzy logic have different features that make them suitable for certain problems but unsuitable for others. Neural networks, on the one hand, are valuable tools for identifying patterns. However, they need to make it easier for …
