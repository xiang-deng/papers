Many knowledge graphs (KGs) constructed automatically or manually contain noises inevitably when adding heterogeneous data nowadays. The existing methods either have difficulty in detecting noisy triples with conflicted relations or ignore to represent triples after noise elimination, which creates obstacles for the downstream tasks to manipulate KGs. To detect various types of noises in KGs and constitute noise-free triples representation, this paper proposes a high-accuracy KG noise detection Cites: Does William Shakespeare really write Hamlet? knowledge
