This study aims to simulate the environment of a sorting system consisting of two integrated stations for object selection and path planning for further research. We consider a conveyor belt moving at a constant speed and carrying different objects. The objects have different types, colours, shapes, and priorities. Given a set of objects on the conveyor, we wish to formulate a reinforcement learning model to find an optimal strategy to select objects with the highest priorities. The priorities are …
