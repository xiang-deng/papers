Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with the powerful capacity to explore graph-structural data has gained noticeable success in recent years. Nonetheless, most of the existing GCN-based models suffer from the notorious over-smoothing issue, owing to which shallow networks are extensively adopted. This may be problematic for complex graph datasets because a deeper GCN should be beneficial to propagating information across remote neighbors. Recent works have devoted effort …
