We propose a new method for training survival analysis models that minimizes a worst-case error across all subpopulations that are large enough (occurring with at least a user-specified minimum probability). Our method uses a loss function that does not know any demographic information to treat as sensitive. Despite this, we demonstrate that our proposed method often scores better on recently established fairness metrics (without a significant drop in prediction accuracy) compared to …
