Large Language Models have demonstrated significant ability in accomplishing a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their performance is highly sensitive to the even minor changes in the phrasing of the task instructions, leading to a line of research in automatic instruction optimization towards better performance for NLP tasks. Unfortunately, existing methods for instruction optimization fail to consider the distribution shift between the seen training …
