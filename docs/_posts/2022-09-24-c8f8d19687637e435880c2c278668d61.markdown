Large language models (LLMs) trained on code completion have been shown to be capable of synthesizing simple Python programs from docstrings [1]. We find that these code-writing LLMs can be re-purposed to write robot policy code, given natural language commands. Specifically, policy code can express functions or feedback loops that process perception outputs (eg, from object detectors [2],[3]) and parameterize control primitive APIs. When provided as input several example  Cites: Least-to-Most Prompting Enables Complex Reasoning in Large
