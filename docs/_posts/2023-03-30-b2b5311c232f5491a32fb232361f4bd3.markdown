Current research on the advantages and trade-offs of using characters, instead of tokenized text, as input for deep learning models, has evolved substantially. New token-free models remove the traditional tokenization step; however, their efficiency remains unclear. Moreover, the effect of tokenization is relatively unexplored in sequence tagging tasks. To this end, we investigate the impact of tokenization when extracting information from documents and present a comparative study and analysis Cites: Deep contextualized word representations
