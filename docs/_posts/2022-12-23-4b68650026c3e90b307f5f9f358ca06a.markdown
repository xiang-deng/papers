Despite the surprising few-shot performance of in-context learning (ICL), it is still a common practice to randomly sample examples to serve as context. This paper advocates a new principle for ICL: self-adaptive in-context learning. The self-adaption mechanism is introduced to help each sample find an in-context example permutation (ie, selection and ordering) that can derive the correct prediction, thus maximizing performance. To validate the effectiveness of self-adaptive ICL, we …
