The main task of Cross-Domain Sentiment Classification is to train a well-performing classification model by using labeled source domain data, and then transfer the model to unlabeled target domain data, thereby solving the expensive labor consumption and domain shift caused by a large number of labels resulting performance degradation. Most mainstream adversarial domain adaptation methods are based on a single discriminator, which ignores the uneven distribution of labels Cites: Document modeling with gated recurrent neural network for
