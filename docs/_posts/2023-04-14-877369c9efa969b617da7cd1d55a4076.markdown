Deep reinforcement learning is an agent modeling method with both deep learning feature extraction ability and reinforcement learning sequence decision-making ability, which can make up for the depleted non-stationary adaptation, complex feature selection and insufficient state-space representation ability of traditional opponent modeling. The deep reinforcement learning-based opponent modeling methods are divided into two categories, explicit modeling and implicit modeling, and …
