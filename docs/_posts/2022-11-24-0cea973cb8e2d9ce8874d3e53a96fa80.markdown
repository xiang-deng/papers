Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have become the de facto standard to achieve outstanding performances and demonstrate significant impact on various computer vision tasks for real-world scenarios. However, the trained networks can often suffer from overfitting issues due to the unintended bias in a dataset causing inaccurate, unreliable, and untrustworthy results. Thus, recent studies have attempted to remove bias by augmenting the bias-conflict samples to address this Cites: Examining and Combating Spurious Features under Distribution Shift
