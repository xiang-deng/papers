Fast dose calculation is critical for online and real time adaptive therapy workflows. While modern physics-based dose algorithms must compromise accuracy to achieve low computation times, deep learning models can potentially perform dose prediction tasks with both high fidelity and speed. We present a deep learning algorithm that, exploiting synergies between Transformer and convolutional layers, accurately predicts broad photon beam dose distributions in few milliseconds. The proposed …
