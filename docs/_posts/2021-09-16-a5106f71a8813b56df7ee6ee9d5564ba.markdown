The task of learning from only a few examples (called a few-shot setting) is of key importance and relevance to a real-world setting. For question answering (QA), the current state-ofthe-art pre-trained models typically need finetuning on tens of thousands of examples to obtain good results. Their performance degrades significantly in a few-shot setting (< 100 examples). To address this, we propose a finetuning framework that leverages pre-trained text-to-text models and is directly Cites: TyDi QA: A benchmark for information-seeking question answering
