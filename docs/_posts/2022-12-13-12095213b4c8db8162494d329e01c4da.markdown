Hyperbolic embeddings have recently received attention in machine learning because of their better ability to handle hierarchical data than Euclidean embeddings. Moreover, Hyperbolic models are also being developed for multi-relational knowledge graphs which contain multiple hierarchical relationships and have achieved promising results, such as MuRP, HyperKG, and ROTH. However, not all data is hierarchical. We also found that most of the geometry models were trained Cites: Embedding entities and relations for learning and inference in
