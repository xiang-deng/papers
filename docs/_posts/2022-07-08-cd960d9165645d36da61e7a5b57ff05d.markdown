In this work we operate on the view that the pragmatic employment of objects by an agent is manifested via their affordances for that specific agent. What affordances can manifest themselves in a particular situation depends, in part, on the dispositions offered by the particular objects involved. The contribution of this work is to construct and deploy a large scale formal model of dispositions for physical objects that can be employed to constrain and describe the roles they can play in narratives.
