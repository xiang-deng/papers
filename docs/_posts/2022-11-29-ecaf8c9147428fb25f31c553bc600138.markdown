Knowledge base completion (KBC) is the task of predicting and filling missing information based on the current data in that knowledge base. Recently, one of the most feasible approaches introduced by V. Kocijan and T. Lukasiewicz (2021) is to transfer knowledge from one collection of information to another without the need for entity or relation matching. Still, this work has not scaled pre-training to larger models and datasets and investigated the impact of the encoder architecture. In this work, we …
