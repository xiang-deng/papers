Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been successfully applied in challenging tasks, their application in real-world operational settings is challenged by methods limited ability to provide explanations. Among the paradigms for explainability in DRL is the interpretable box design paradigm, where interpretable models substitute inner constituent models of the DRL method, thus making the DRL method inherently interpretable.
