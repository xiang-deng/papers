A diverse set of scheduling objectives (eg, resource contention, fairness, priority, etc.) breed a series of objective-specific schedulers for multi-core architectures. Existing designs incorporate thread-to-thread statistics at runtime, and schedule threads based on such an abstraction (we formalize thread-to-thread interaction as the Thread-Interaction Matrix). However, such an abstraction also reveals a consistently-overlooked issue: the Thread-Interaction Matrix (TIM) is highly sparse. Therefore …
