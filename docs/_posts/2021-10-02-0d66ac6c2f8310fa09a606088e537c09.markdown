In this work, we demonstrate a full photonic integrated device for performing highly- sensitive biosensing using silicon nitride ring resonators propagating transverse- magnetic modes at wavelengths around 1310 nm. The device includes fully-etched grating couplers as interfaces with external optical fibres. Sensing experiments are performed in a microfluidic environment using bovine serum albumin and anti-bovine serum albumin as biological agents.
