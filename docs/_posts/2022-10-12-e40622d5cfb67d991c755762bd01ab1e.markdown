Data fusion of hyperspectral and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is conducive to obtain more comprehensive surface information and thereby achieve better classification result in Earth Monitoring Systems. However, lack of labeled samples usually limits the performance of supervised classifiers, and the heterogeneity of multi-source data also brings great challenges to data fusion. Aiming to address these issues, we propose a triplet semi-supervised deep convolutional neural Cites: Rethinking pre-training and self-training
