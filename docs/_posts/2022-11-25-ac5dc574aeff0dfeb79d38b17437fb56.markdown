We present a new approach to dialogue management using conversational knowledge graphs as core representation of the dialogue state. To this end, we introduce a new dataset, GraphWOZ, which comprises Wizard-of-Oz dialogues in which human participants interact with a robot acting as a receptionist. In contrast to most existing work on dialogue management, GraphWOZ relies on a dialogue state explicitly represented as a dynamic knowledge graph instead of a fixed set of slots …
