Handling long texts with structural information and excluding redundancy between summary sentences are essential in extractive document summarization. In this work, we propose GoSum, a novel reinforcement-learning-based extractive model for long-paper summarization. GoSum encodes states by building a heterogeneous graph from different discourse levels for each input document. We evaluate the model on two datasets of scientific articles summarization: PubMed and arXiv where it …
