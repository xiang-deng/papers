Figurative language understanding has been recently framed as a recognizing textual entailment (RTE) task (aka natural language inference (NLI)). However, similar to classical RTE/NLI datasets they suffer from spurious correlations and annotation artifacts. To tackle this problem, work on NLI has built explanation-based datasets such as eSNLI, allowing us to probe whether language models are right for the right reasons. Yet no such data exists for figurative language, making it harder to Cites: Testing the Ability of Language Models to Interpret Figurative
