Humans are able to reason from multiple sources to arrive at the correct answer. In the context of Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA), knowledge graphs can provide subgraphs based on different combinations of questions and answers, mimicking the way humans find answers. However, current research mainly focuses on independent reasoning on a single graph for each questionanswer pair, lacking the ability for joint reasoning among all answer candidates. In this paper, we propose  Cites: Muppet: Massive multi-task representations with pre-finetuning
