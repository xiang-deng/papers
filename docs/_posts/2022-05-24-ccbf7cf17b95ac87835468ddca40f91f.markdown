We present a generic and trend-aware curriculum learning approach for graph neural networks. It extends existing approaches by incorporating sample-level loss trends to better discriminate easier from harder samples and schedule them for training. The model effectively integrates textual and structural information for relation extraction in text graphs. Experimental results show that the model provides robust estimations of sample difficulty and shows sizable improvement over the state-of-the  Cites: Cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction with graph lstms
