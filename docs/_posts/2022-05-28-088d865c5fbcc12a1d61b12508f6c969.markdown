Weather classification from single images is significant for many outdoor computer vision applications, while it has not been thoroughly studied. Existing methods view it as a supervised task under the guidance of weather labels. Though these methods have made great success, they are not applicable to real-world applications because of their reliance on massive human-annotated weather images. In this paper, we take the initial attempt to treat weather classification as an unsupervised task, ie to classify  Cites: Randaugment: Practical automated data augmentation with a
