The complexity of modern software makes it nearly impossible to detect every fault before deployment. Such faults can ultimately lead to failures at runtime, compromising the business process and leading to non-negligible costs or losses. Online Failure Prediction (OFP) is a fault-tolerance technique that attempts to predict incoming failures to avoid or mitigate their consequences based on the analysis of past data and the current system state.
