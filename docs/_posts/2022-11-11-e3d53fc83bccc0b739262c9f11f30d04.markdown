Known vulnerabilities in software are solved through security patches; thus, applying such patches as soon as they are released is crucial to protect from cyber-attacks. The diffusion of open source software allowed to inspect the patches to understand whether they are security related or not. In this paper, we propose some solutions based on state-of-the-art deep learn-ing technologies for Natural Language Process-ing for security patches detection. In the exper-iments, we benchmarked our Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
