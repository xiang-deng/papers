While probabilistic language generators have improved dramatically over the last few years, the automatic evaluation metrics used to assess them have not kept pace with this progress. In the domain of language generation, a good metric must correlate highly with human judgements. Yet, with few exceptions, there is a lack of such metrics in the literature. In this work, we analyse the general paradigm of language generator evaluation. We first discuss the computational and qualitative  Cites: Neural text generation with unlikelihood training
