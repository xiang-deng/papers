Although neural information retrieval has witnessed great improvements, recent works showed that the generalization ability of dense retrieval models on target domains with different distributions is limited, which contrasts with the results obtained with interaction-based models. To address this issue, researchers have resorted to adversarial learning and query generation approaches; both approaches nevertheless resulted in limited improvements. In this paper, we propose to use a self …
