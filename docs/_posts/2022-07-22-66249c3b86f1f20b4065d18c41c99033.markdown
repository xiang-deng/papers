Natural language (NL) toolkits enable visualization developers, who may not have a background in natural language processing (NLP), to create natural language interfaces (NLIs) for end-users to flexibly specify and interact with visualizations. However, these toolkits currently only support one-off utterances, with minimal capability to facilitate a multi-turn dialog between the user and the system. Developing NLIs with such conversational interaction capabilities remains a  Cites: Cosql: A conversational text-to-sql challenge towards cross
