One major issue that challenges person re-identification (Re-ID) is the ubiquitous occlusion over the captured persons. There are two main challenges for the occluded person Re-ID problem, ie., the interference of noise during feature matching and the loss of pedestrian information brought by the occlusions. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Feature Recovery Transformer (FRT) to address the two challenges simultaneously, which mainly consists of visibility graph  Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
