Abstract Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer missing links between entities based on the observed ones. Current KGC methods primarily focus on KG embedding models, which project entities and relations as low-dimensional vectors. Recently, the combination of textual information with graph neural network models has drawn extensive attention due to their superiority in utilizing topological structures, benefiting from the message passing mechanism, and their effectiveness  Cites: Detecting formal thought disorder by deep contextualized word
