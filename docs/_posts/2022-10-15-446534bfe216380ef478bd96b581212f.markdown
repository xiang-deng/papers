Biased dataset will lead models to learn bias features highly correlated to labels, which will deteriorate the performance especially when the test data deviates from the training distribution. Most existing solutions resort to introducing additional data to explicitly balance the dataset, eg, counterfactually generating augmented data. In this paper, we argue that there actually exist valuable samples within the original dataset which are potential to assist model circumvent spurious correlations. We call  Cites: Finding and fixing spurious patterns with explanations
