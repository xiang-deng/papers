By numerically solving the time-dependent Schrdinger equation, we theoretically investigated the dynamic interference in multiphoton excitation and ionization of hydrogen irradiated by 400-nm linearly polarized laser pulses. Interference of the multiphoton excitation paths at the rising and falling edges of the laser pulses gives rise to the fast oscillations of the intensity-dependent yield of the excited states. Our results show that the period of the oscillation increases abruptly when the laser  Cites: Observation of dynamic Stark resonances in strong-field excitation
