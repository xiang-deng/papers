Bearings are commonly used to reduce friction between moving parts. Bearings may fail due to lubrication failure, contamination, corrosion, and fatigue. To prevent bearing failures, it is important to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of bearings. While many data-driven methods have been introduced, very few studies have considered the correlation of features at different time points, such a correlation could be used to identify and aggregate features at different time points for improving the  Cites: Long short-term memory-networks for machine reading
