While there have been significant gains in the field of automated video description, the generalization performance of automated description models to novel domains remains a major barrier to using these systems in the real world. Most visual description methods are known to capture and exploit patterns in the training data leading to evaluation metric increases, but what are those patterns? In this work, we examine several popular visual description datasets, and capture, analyze, and …
