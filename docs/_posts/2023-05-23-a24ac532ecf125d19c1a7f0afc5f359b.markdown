Several recent papers claim human parity at sentence-level Machine Translation (MT), especially in high-resource languages. Thus, in response, the MT community has, in part, shifted its focus to document-level translation. Translating documents requires a deeper understanding of the structure and meaning of text, which is often captured by various kinds of discourse phenomena such as consistency, coherence, and cohesion. However, this renders conventional sentence-level MT evaluation …
