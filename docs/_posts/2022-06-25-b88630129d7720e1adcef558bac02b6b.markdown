The recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have transformed the field of natural language processing (NLP). From GPT-3 to PaLM, the state-of-the-art performance on natural language tasks is being pushed forward with every new large language model. Along with natural language abilities, there has been a significant interest in understanding whether such models, trained on enormous amounts of data, exhibit reasoning capabilities. Hence there has been interest in Cites: Beyond the Imitation Game: Quantifying and extrapolating the
