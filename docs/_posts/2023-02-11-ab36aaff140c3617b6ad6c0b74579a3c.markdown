Among the incoming challenges in monitoring systems, the aggregation, synthesis and management of knowledge through ontological structures hold an essential place. Existing knowledge extraction systems often use a supervised approach that relies on annotated data, inducing implicitly a fastidious annotation process. Current research is towards the definition of unsupervised or semi-supervised systems, allowing a wider range of knowledge extraction. The evaluation of such systems  Cites: Few-NERD: A Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition Dataset
