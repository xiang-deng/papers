Abstract Knowledge Base Question Answering systems (KBQA) aim to find answers to natural language questions over a knowledge base. This work presents a template matching approach for Complex KBQA systems (C-KBQA) using the combination of Semantic Parsing and Neural Networks techniques to classify natural language questions into answer templates. An attention mechanism was created to assist a Tree-LSTM in selecting the most important information. The approach was evaluated …
