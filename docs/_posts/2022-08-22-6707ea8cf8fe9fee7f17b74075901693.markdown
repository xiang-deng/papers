Semantic segmentation is widely used in automatic driving systems. To quickly and accurately classify objects in emergency situations, a large number of images need to be processed per second. To make a semantic segmentation model run on hardware with low memory and limited computing capacity, this paper proposes a real-time semantic segmentation network called MRFDCNet. This architecture is based on our proposed multireceptive field dense connection (MRFDC) module. The Cites: ESPNetv2: A Light-weight, Power Efficient, and General Purpose
