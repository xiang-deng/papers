Background The purpose of this study is to assess the viability of a knee arthroplasty prediction model using 3 view x-rays that helps determine if patients with knee pain are candidates for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA), or are not arthroplasty candidates. Methods Analysis was performed using radiographic and surgical data from a high-volume joint replacement practice. The dataset included three different x-ray views (Anterior Posterior (AP), Lateral, and Cites: Prediction of total knee replacement and diagnosis of osteoarthritis
