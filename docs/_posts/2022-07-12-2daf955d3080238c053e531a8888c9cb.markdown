A computing device classifies unclassified observations. A first batch of unclassified observation vectors and a first batch of classified observation vectors are selected. A prior regularization error value and a decoder reconstruction error value are computed. A first batch of noise observation vectors is generated. An evidence lower bound (ELBO) value is computed. A gradient of an encoder neural network model is computed, and the ELBO value is updated. A decoder neural network model and an …
