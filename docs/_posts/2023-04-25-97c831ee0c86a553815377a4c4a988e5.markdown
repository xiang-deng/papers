With the rapid growth of machine learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) are now being used in numerous domains. Unfortunately, DNNs are black-boxes, and cannot be interpreted by humans, which is a substantial concern in safety-critical systems. To mitigate this issue, researchers have begun working on explainable AI (XAI) methods, which can identify a subset of input features that are the cause of a DNN s decision for a given input. Most existing techniques are heuristic, and cannot  Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
