We present the hierarchical graph infomax (HGI) approach for learning urban region representations (vector embeddings) with points-of-interest (POIs) in a fully unsupervised manner, which can be used in various downstream tasks. Specifically, HGI comprises several key steps:(1) training category embeddings as the initial features of POIs;(2) interconnecting POIs with a graph structure and performing graph convolution to capture the uniqueness of each POI based on its spatial  Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
