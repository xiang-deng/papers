In spite deep learning has advanced numerous successes, recent research has shown increasing concern on its vulnerability over adversarial attacks. In Natural Language Processing, crafting high-quality adversarial text examples is much more challenging due to the discrete nature of texts. Recent studies perform transformations on characters or words, which are generally formulated as combinatorial optimization problems. However, these approaches suffer from …
