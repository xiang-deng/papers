Good models require good training data. For overparameterized deep models, the causal relationship between training data and model predictions is increasingly opaque and poorly understood. Influence analysis partially demystifies training s underlying interactions by quantifying the amount each training instance alters the final model. Measuring the training data s influence exactly can be provably hard in the worst case; this has led to the development and use of influence estimators Cites: FastIF: Scalable Influence Functions for Efficient Model
