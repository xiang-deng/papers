Automatic summarization is the process of shortening a set of textual data computationally, to create a subset (a summary) that represents the most important pieces of information in the original text. Existing summarization methods can be roughly divided into two types: extractive and abstractive. An extractive summarizer explicitly selects text snippets (words, phrases, sentences, etc.) from the source document, while an abstractive summarizer generates novel text snippets to convey Cites: Asking and Answering Questions to Evaluate the Factual
