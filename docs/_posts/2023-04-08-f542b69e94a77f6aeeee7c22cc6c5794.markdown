Language models (LMs) have recently shown remarkable performance on reasoning tasks by explicitly generating intermediate inferences, eg, chain-of-thought prompting. However, these intermediate inference steps may be inappropriate deductions from the initial context and lead to incorrect final predictions. Here we introduce REFINER, a framework for finetuning LMs to explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps while interacting with a critic model that provides …
