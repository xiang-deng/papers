Machine Learning for Source Code (ML4Code) is an active research field in which extensive experimentation is needed to discover how to best use source code s richly structured information. With this in mind, we introduce JEMMA, an Extensible Java Dataset for ML4Code Applications, which is a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset targeted at ML4Code. Our goal with JEMMA is to lower the barrier to entry in ML4Code by providing the building blocks to experiment with source code models  Cites: GraphCodeBERT: Pre-training Code Representations with Data
