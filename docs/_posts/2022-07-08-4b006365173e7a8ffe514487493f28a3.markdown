The evaluation of knowledge quality (KQ) in multisource knowledge graphs (KGs) is an essential step for many applications, such as fragmented knowledge fusion and knowledge base construction. Many existing quality evaluation methods for multisource knowledge are based on validation from high-quality knowledge bases or statistical analysis of knowledge related to a specific fact from multiple sources, named external consistency (EC)-based methods. However, high-quality KGs are Cites: Latent credibility analysis
