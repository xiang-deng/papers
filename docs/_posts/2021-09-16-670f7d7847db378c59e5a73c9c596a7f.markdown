In software development, source code documents play essential role during program comprehension and software maintenance. Natural language descriptions and identifier names are the main parts of the source code document. Source code document generation spares the working hours of developers. Automatic source code documentation is a rapidly growing research area at the present time. Researchers have proposed various template based, IR based (information Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
