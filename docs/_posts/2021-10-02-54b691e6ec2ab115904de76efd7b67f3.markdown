Bug datasets consisting of real-world bugs are important artifacts for researchers and programmers, which lay empirical and experimental foundation for various SE/PL research such as fault localization, software testing, and program repair. All known state-of-the-art datasets are constructed manually, which inevitably limits their scalability, representativeness, and the support for the emerging data-driven research. In this work, we propose an approach to automate the process of Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
