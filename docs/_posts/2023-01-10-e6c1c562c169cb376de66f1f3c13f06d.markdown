The complex and opaque decision-making process of machine learning models restrains the interpretability of predictions and makes them cannot mine results outside of learning experiences. The causality between features and the target variable can be traced by injecting counterfactual explanations into the prediction model and generating counterfactual instances using adjusted features to reverse the prediction results. Existing algorithms, such as Diverse Counterfactual Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
