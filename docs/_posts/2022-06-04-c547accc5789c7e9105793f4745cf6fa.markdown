Most works of image captioning are implemented under the full supervision of paired image-caption data. Limited to expensive cost of data collection, the task of unpaired image captioning has attracted researchers  attention. In this article, we propose a novel memorial GAN (MemGAN) with the joint semantic optimization for unpaired image captioning. The core idea is to explore implicit semantic correlation between disjointed images and sentences through building a multimodal semantic-aware … Cites: ‪Unsupervised neural machine translation‬
