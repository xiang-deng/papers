In this paper, we build multivariate analysis models to predict stock price movement on Carriage Services, Inc. stocks data. Stock prices depends on various factors and their complex dynamics which makes them a difficult problem in real world. The purpose of this paper is to analyses the capability of a neural network to solve this problem efficiently. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) has demonstrated its capability of addressing complex time series problems. We analyzed different Cites: Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder
