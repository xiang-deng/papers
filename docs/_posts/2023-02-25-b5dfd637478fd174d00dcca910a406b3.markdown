Costly, noisy, and over-specialized, labels are to be set aside in favor of unsupervised learning if we hope to learn cheap, reliable, and transferable models. To that end, spectral embedding, self-supervised learning, or generative modeling have offered competitive solutions. Those methods however come with numerous challenges\textit {eg} estimating geodesic distances, specifying projector architectures and anti-collapse losses, or specifying decoder architectures and …
