A substantial amount of research has been carried out in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models, especially in those which explain the deep architectures of neural networks. A number of XAI approaches have been proposed to achieve trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) models as well as provide explainability of specific decisions made within these models. Among these approaches, global interpretation methods have emerged as the prominent methods of explainability because they  Cites: Model-agnostic interpretability of machine learning
