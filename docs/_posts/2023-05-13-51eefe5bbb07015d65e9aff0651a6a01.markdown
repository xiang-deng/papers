Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a pertinent tool for any machine learning task due to their ability to learn functions over graph structures, a powerful and expressive data representation. The detection of communities, an unsupervised task has increasingly been performed with GNNs. Clustering nodes in a graph using the multi-dimensionality of node features with the connectivity of the graph has many applications to real world tasks from social networks to genomics. Unfortunately …
