We propose a data-driven algorithm for numerical invariant synthesis and verification. The algorithm is based on the ICE-DT schema for learning decision trees from samples that include positive and negative states and additionally implications corresponding to transitions in the program. The main issue we address is the discovery of relevant attributes to be used in the learning process of numerical invariants. We define a method for solving this problem that is guided by the data … Cites: ‪Learning invariants using decision trees and implication …‬
