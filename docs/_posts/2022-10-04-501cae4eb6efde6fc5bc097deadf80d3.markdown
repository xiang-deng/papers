Deep language algorithms, like GPT-2, have demonstrated remarkable abilities to process text, and now constitute the backbone of automatic translation, summarization and dialogue. However, whether these models encode information that relates to human comprehension still remains controversial. Here, we show that the representations of GPT-2 not only map onto the brain responses to spoken stories, but they also predict the extent to which subjects understand the …
