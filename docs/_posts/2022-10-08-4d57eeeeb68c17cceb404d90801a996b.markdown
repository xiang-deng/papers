Since the release of various large-scale natural language processing (NLP) pre-trained models, parameter efficient transfer learning (PETL) has become a popular paradigm capable of achieving impressive performance on various downstream tasks. PETL aims at making good use of the representation knowledge in the pre-trained large models by fine-tuning a small number of parameters. Recently, it has also attracted increasing attention to developing various PETL techniques for vision Cites: VL-Adapter: Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for Vision-and
