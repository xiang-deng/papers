Temporal concept drift refers to the problem of data changing over time. In NLP, that would entail that language (eg new expressions, meaning shifts) and factual knowledge (eg new concepts, updated facts) evolve over time. Focusing on the latter, we benchmark $11 $ pretrained masked language models (MLMs) on a series of tests designed to evaluate the effect of temporal concept drift, as it is crucial that widely used language models remain up-to-date with the ever-evolving factual …
