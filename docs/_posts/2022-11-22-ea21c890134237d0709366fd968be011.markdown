The superior performance of modern deep networks usually comes at the price of a costly training procedure. In this paper, we present a novel curriculum learning approach for the efficient training of visual backbones (eg, vision Transformers). The proposed method is inspired by the phenomenon that deep networks mainly learn to recognize some easier-to-learn discriminative patterns within each example at earlier stages of training, eg, the lower-frequency components of images and the original Cites: Efficientnetv2: Smaller models and faster training
