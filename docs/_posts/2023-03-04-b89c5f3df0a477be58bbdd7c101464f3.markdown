Despite the recent success of large pretrained language models (LMs) on a variety of prompting tasks, these models can be alarmingly brittle to small changes in inputs or application contexts. To better understand such behavior and motivate the design of more robust LMs, we propose a general experimental framework, CALM (Competence-based Analysis of Language Models), where targeted causal interventions are utilized to damage an LM s internal representation of various …
