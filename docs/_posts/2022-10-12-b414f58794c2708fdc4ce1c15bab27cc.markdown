Strong static type systems help programmers eliminate many errors without much burden of supplying type annotations. However, this flexibility makes it highly non-trivial to diagnose ill-typed programs, especially for novice programmers. Compared to classic constraint solving and optimization-based approaches, the data-driven approach has shown great promise in identifying the root causes of type errors with higher accuracy. Instead of relying on hand-engineered features, this work explores Cites: Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural
