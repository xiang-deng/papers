Method: We conduct this study as design science research. We identify the problem instance in the context of emergency department (ED) wait-time prediction. In this paper, we develop an effective and efficient fairness testing approach to evaluate the fairness of regression-based ML systems. We propose fairness degree, which is a new fairness measure for regression-based ML systems, and a novel search-based fairness testing (SBFT) approach for testing regression-based machine learning Cites:   Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
