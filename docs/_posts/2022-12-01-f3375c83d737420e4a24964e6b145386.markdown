Multi-agent systems in which secondary agents with conflicting agendas also alter their methods need opponent modeling. In this study, we simulate the main agent s and secondary agents  tactics using Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) with a prioritized experience replay mechanism. Then, under the opponent modeling setup, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture is used to identify various opponent strategy patterns. Finally, we analyze our models in two environments with several agents …
