Advancements in Deep Learning (DL) have enabled leveraging large-scale datasets to train models that perform challenging tasks at a level that mimics human intelligence. In several real-world scenarios, the data used for training, the trained model, and the data used for inference can be private and distributed across multiple distrusting parties, posing a challenge for training and inference. Several privacy-preserving training and inference frameworks have been developed to address this …
