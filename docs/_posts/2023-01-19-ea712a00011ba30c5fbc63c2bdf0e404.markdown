Large pre-trained language models consistently top the leaderboard for benchmarks across a variety of NLP tasks. However, due to the high complexity of these models, it is challenging for researchers, developers, and AI end-users to understand how these models make prediction decisions. Understanding model behavior is crucial for identifying the limitations of AI systems, diagnosing flaws in model architectures and datasets, and building trust with the global community who are affected by AI  Cites: Piqa: Reasoning about physical commonsense in natural language
