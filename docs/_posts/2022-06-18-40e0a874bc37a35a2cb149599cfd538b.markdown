Though much effort has been spent on designing new active learning algorithms, little attention has been paid to the initialization problem of active learning, ie, how to find a set of labeled samples which contains at least one instance per category. This work identifies the initialization of active learning as a separate and novel research problem, reviews existing methods that can be adapted to be used for this task and, in addition, proposes a new active initialization criterion: the Nearest Neighbor
