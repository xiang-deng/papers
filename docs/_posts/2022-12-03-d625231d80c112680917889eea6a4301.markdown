Explainable artificial intelligence has received great interest in the recent decade, due to its importance in critical application domains such as self-driving cars, law and healthcare. Genetic programming is a powerful evolutionary algorithm for machine learning. Compared with other standard machine learning models such as neural networks, the models evolved by GP tend to be more interpretable due to their model structure with symbolic components. However, interpretability has not been explicitly  Cites: Evolving reinforcement learning algorithms
