Machine learning based on graph data is a hard task due to the complex structure of graph data. When this 12 topic comes to quantum machine learning, it becomes more challenging due to the limited resources in 13 the current NISQ era, in particular when a neural network can have thousands or even millions of 14 parameters. In this paper, to address these challenges, we proposed a novel quantum graph neural network 15 that uses only a single qubit. In our novel work, a …
