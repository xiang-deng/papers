Pollutant prediction for coal-fired circulating fluidized bed units is crucial for ultra-low emission optimization. Accurate prediction models can assist in the control optimization of the unit. Mechanism models are limited by the determination of parameters, coefficients, and fitting functions in the model and require a large amount of operational and unit design data in practical applications. With the development of deep learning, more and more deep learning models are used in …
