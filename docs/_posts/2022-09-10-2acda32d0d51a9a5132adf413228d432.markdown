Adversarial training (AT) with samples generated by Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), also known as FGSM-AT, is a computationally simple method to train robust networks. However, during its training procedure, an unstable mode of catastrophic overfitting has been identified in arXiv: 2001.03994 [cs. LG], where the robust accuracy abruptly drops to zero within a single training step. Existing methods use gradient regularizers or random initialization tricks to attenuate this issue, whereas  Cites: Smooth adversarial training
