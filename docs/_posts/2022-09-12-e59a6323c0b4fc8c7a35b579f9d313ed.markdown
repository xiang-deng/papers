Graph Neural Networks achieve state-of-the-art performance on a plethora of graph classification tasks, especially due to pooling operators, which aggregate learned node embeddings hierarchically into a final graph representation. However, they are not only questioned by recent work showing on par performance with random pooling, but also ignore completely higher-order connectivity patterns. To tackle this issue, we propose HoscPool, a clustering-based graph pooling operator that Cites: Graph neural networks: A review of methods and applications
