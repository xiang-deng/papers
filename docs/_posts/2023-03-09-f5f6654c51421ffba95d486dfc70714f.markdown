Automatic grading of short answers is an important task in computer-assisted assessment (CAA). Recently, embeddings, as semantic-rich textual representations, have been increasingly used to represent short answers and predict the grade.

Therefore, following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, this scoping review summarises  Cites: Sentence movers similarity: Automatic evaluation for multi
