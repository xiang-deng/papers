Text classification is a common task in data science. Despite the superior performances of deep learning based models in various text classification tasks, their blackbox nature poses significant challenges for wide adoption. The knowledgeto action framework emphasizes several principles concerning the application and use of knowledge, such as easeofuse, customization, and feedback. With the guidance of the above principles and the properties of interpretable machine learning, we Cites:   Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
