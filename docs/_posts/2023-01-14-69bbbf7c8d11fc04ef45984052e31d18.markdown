Ship detection plays a crucial role in a variety of military and civilian marine inspection applications. Infrared images are irreplaceable data sources for ship detection due to their strong adaptability and excellent all-weather reconnaissance ability. However, previous researches mainly focus on visible light or SAR ship detection, while infrared ship detection is left in a huge blind spot. The main obstacles to this dilemma lie in the absence of public datasets, small scale and poor Cites: Espnet: Efficient spatial pyramid of dilated convolutions for
