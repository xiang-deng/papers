Few-shot relation extraction (FSRE) aims at recognizing unseen relations by learning with merely a handful of annotated instances. To more effectively generalize to new relations, this paper proposes a novel pipeline for the FSRE task based on adaptive prototype fusion. Specifically, for each relation class, the pipeline fully explores the relation information by concatenating two types of embedding, and then elaborately combine the relation representation with the adaptive prototype fusion mechanism …
