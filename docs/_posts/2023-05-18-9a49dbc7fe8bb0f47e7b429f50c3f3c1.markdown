Human-in-the-loop topic models allow users to encode feedback to modify topic models without changing the core machinery of the topic models. Basic refinement functions have been proposed in prior works in which the main focus was to modify the top word lists of topics, eg, add a single word in a topic having distribution over a large vocabulary set. In this work, we point out that such refinements have very little to no effect on document-topic associations, which are rather important in practical Cites: Phrase-bert: Improved phrase embeddings from bert with an
