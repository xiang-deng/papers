Classification algorithms have recently acquired a great popularity due to their efficiency to generate models capable of solving high complexity problems. Specifically, black box models are the ones that offer the best results, since they greatly benefit from the enormous amount of data available to learn models in an increasingly accurate way. However, their main disadvantage compared to other simpler algorithms, eg decision trees, is the loss of interpretability for both the model
