Temporal Knowledge graph (TKG) is a key component of artificial intelligence. In recent years, many large-scale temporal knowledge graphs have been produced and put into practical applications. At present, researchers have proposed many methods to reason facts that do not exist in temporal knowledge graph using the existing information. However, most traditional embedding-based reasoning methods of temporal knowledge graph lack interpretability, cannot get the reasoning …
