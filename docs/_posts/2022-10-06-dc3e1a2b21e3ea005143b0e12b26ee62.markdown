Artificial intelligence (AI) models based on deep learning now represent the state of the art for making functional predictions in genomics research. However, the underlying basis on which predictive models make such predictions is often unknown. For genomics researchers, this missing explanatory information would frequently be of greater value than the predictions themselves, as it can enable new insights into genetic processes. We review progress in the emerging area of  Cites: Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate
