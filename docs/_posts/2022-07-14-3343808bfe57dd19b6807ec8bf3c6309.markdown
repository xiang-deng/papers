Topic models are a useful and popular method to find latent topics of documents. However, the short and sparse texts in social media micro-blogs such as Twitter are challenging for the most commonly used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model. We compare the performance of the standard LDA topic model with the Gibbs Sampler Dirichlet Multinomial Model (GSDMM) and the Gamma Poisson Mixture Model (GPM), which are specifically designed for sparse data. To compare the …
