Recently, there has been significant progress in teaching language models to perform step-by-step reasoning to solve complex numerical reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thoughts prompting (CoT) is by far the state-of-art method for these tasks. CoT uses language models to perform both reasoning and computation in the multi-stepthought process. To disentangle computation from reasoning, we proposeProgram of Thoughts (PoT), which uses language models (mainly Codex) to  Cites: Binding language models in symbolic languages
