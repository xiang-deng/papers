Abstract Machine learning (ML), as a component of artificial intelligence, encourages structural design exploration which leads to new technological advancements. By developing and generating data-driven methodologies that supplement conventional physics and formula-based approaches, deep learning (DL), a subset of machine learning offers an efficient way to understand and harness artificial materials and structures. Recently, acoustic and mechanics communities have observed a surge of  Cites: Reasoning With Neural Tensor Networks for Knowledge Base
