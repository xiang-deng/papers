We use a text dataset consisting of 23 news categories relevant to pharma information science, in order to compare the fine-tuning performance of multiple transformer models in a classification task. Using a well-balanced dataset with multiple autoregressive and autocoding transformation models, we compare their fine-tuning performance. To validate the winning approach, we perform diagnostics of model behavior on mispredicted instances, including inspection of category-wise Cites: Electra: Pre-training text encoders as discriminators rather than
