Crowdsourcing truth inference aims to assign a correct answer to each task from candidate answers that are provided by crowdsourced workers. A common approach is to generate workers  reliabilities to represent the quality of answers. Although crowdsourced triples can be converted into various crowdsourced relationships, the available related methods are not effective in capturing these relationships to alleviate the harm to inference that is caused by conflicting answers. In this research …
