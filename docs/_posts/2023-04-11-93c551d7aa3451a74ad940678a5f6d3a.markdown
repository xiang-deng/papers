Charge prediction aims to predict charges from the case descriptions and plays a significant role in legal assistance systems. When we use deep learning methods, prediction on high-frequency charges has achieved promising results, but prediction on few-shot charges is still a challenge. To address this issue, a few-shot charge prediction method with data augmentation and neural network is proposed, named BBAE (BERT-BiGRU-Attention based on easy data augmentation techniques), which  Cites: How Does NLP Benefit Legal System: A Summary of Legal
