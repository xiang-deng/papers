In recent years, pretrained models have been widely used in various fields, including natural language understanding, computer vision, and natural language generation. However, the performance of these language generation models is highly dependent on the model size and the dataset size. While larger models excel in some aspects, they cannot learn up-to-date knowledge and are relatively difficult to relearn. In this paper, we introduce EvoText, a novel training method that enhances the …
