The central question that this paper address is: How does the performance of a supervised model vary with respect to the label noise in the testing and training dataset? Answering this question is crucial for many real-world applications for two main reasons. First, most datasets used for training large supervised models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are crowd-sourced. Such datasets are known to have significant label noise due to multiple factors such as the complexity of the annotation Cites: Position-aware Attention and Supervised Data Improve Slot Filling
