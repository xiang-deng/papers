This work proposes a novel data augmentation technique based on symbolic methods SDAR that generates annotations in the text space. The SDAR annotator is an ensemble of multiple sub-annotators, each equipped with a searcher and a symbolic knowledge retriever. We demonstrate that SDAR can boost the performance of smaller models to a comparable degree of or even surpass larger models with a magnitude more parameters and establish the STOA single model  Cites: Language models as knowledge bases?
