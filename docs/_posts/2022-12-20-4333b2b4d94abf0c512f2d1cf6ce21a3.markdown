DataRaceBench (DRB) is a dedicated benchmark suite to evaluate tools aimed to find data race bugs in OpenMP programs. Using microbenchmarks with or without data races, DRB is able to generate standard quality metrics and provide systematic and quantitative assessments of data race detection tools. However, as the number of microbenchmarks grows, it is challenging to manually identify similar code patterns for DRB, within the context of identifying duplicated kernels or guiding the …
