The electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction process has gained enormous attention for both environmental protection and chemicals production. Thereinto, the design of new electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity can draw inspiration from the abundant scientific literature. An annotated and verified corpus made from massive literature can assist the development of natural language processing (NLP) models, which can offer insight to help guide the understanding of these underlying Cites: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language
