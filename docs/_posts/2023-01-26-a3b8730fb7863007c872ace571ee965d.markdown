Machine reading comprehension (MRC) is one of the main research of question answering system tasks. In real-world scenarios, due to the large scale of document data, and many questions that need to be answered urgently, traditional extractive MRC method faces low efficiency, low accuracy, and has poor reasoning ability. In order to efficiently and accurately extract knowledge from massive unstructured text data, we propose a multi-document MRC model based on a two-stage approach Cites: Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research
