Neural-symbolic computing aims at integrating robust neural learning and sound symbolic reasoning into a single framework, so as to leverage the complementary strengths of both of these, seemingly unrelated (maybe even contradictory) AI paradigms. The central challenge in neural-symbolic computing is to unify the formulation of neural learning and symbolic reasoning into a single framework with common semantics, that is, to seek a joint representation between a neural model Cites: Neural symbolic machines: Learning semantic parsers on freebase
