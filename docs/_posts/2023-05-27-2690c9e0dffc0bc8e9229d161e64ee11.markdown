Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have ignited a surge in demand for effective fine-tuning techniques, particularly in low-resource domains and languages. Active learning (AL), a set of algorithms designed to decrease labeling costs by minimizing label complexity, has shown promise in confronting the labeling bottleneck. Concurrently, adapter modules, designed for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), have showcased notable potential in low-resource settings. However, the interplay Cites: Cold-start active learning through self-supervised language
