The latest biological findings discover that the motionless  lock-and-key theory is no longer applicable and the flexibility of both the receptor and ligand plays a significant role in helping understand the principles of the binding affinity prediction. Based on this mechanism, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been invented as a useful tool to investigate the dynamical properties of this molecular system. However, the computational expenditure prohibits the growth of reported protein trajectories Cites: Structure-based protein function prediction using graph
