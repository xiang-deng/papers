Weighted model counting consists of computing the weighted sum of all satisfying assignments of a propositional formula. Weighted model counting is well-known to be# P-hard for exact solving, but admits a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme when restricted to DNF structures. In this work, we study weighted model integration, a generalization of weighted model counting which involves real variables in addition to propositional variables, and pose the following …
