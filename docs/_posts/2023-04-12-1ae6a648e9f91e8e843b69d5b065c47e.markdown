Distribution shifts are problems where the distribution of data changes between training and testing, which can significantly degrade the performance of a model deployed in the real world. Recent studies suggest that one reason for the degradation is a type of overfitting, and that proper regularization can mitigate the degradation, especially when using highly representative models such as neural networks. In this paper, we propose a new regularization using the supervised …
