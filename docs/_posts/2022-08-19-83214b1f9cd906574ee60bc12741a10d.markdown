We consider a global explanation of a regression or classification function by decomposing it into the sum of main components and interaction components of arbitrary order. When adding an identification constraint that is motivated by a causal interpretation, we find q-interaction SHAP to be the unique solution to that constraint. Here, q denotes the highest order of interaction present in the decomposition. Our result provides a new perspective on SHAP values with various practical and Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
