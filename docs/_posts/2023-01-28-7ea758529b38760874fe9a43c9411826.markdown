This study presents an integrated framework of machine learning models (Artificial Neural Network, Ensembled Learning Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Gaussian Process Regression) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to predict and optimize hydrogen production from SCWG using sewage sludge characteristics and process parameters. According to the results, ELT-PSO is preferred for forecasting hydrogen yield (Coefficient of determination (R 2)= 0.997, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) Cites: Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
