In this article, we present a leap-forward expansion to the study of explainability in neural networks by considering explanations as answers to abstract reasoning-based questions. With P as the prediction from a neural network, these questions are Why P?,What if not P?, and Why P, rather than Q? for a given contrast prediction Q. The answers to these questions are observed correlations, counterfactuals, and contrastive explanations, respectively. Together, these explanations constitute the Cites: " Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any
