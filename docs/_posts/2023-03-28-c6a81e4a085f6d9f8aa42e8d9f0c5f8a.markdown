Modern approaches to computing consumer price indices include the use of various data sources, such as web-scraped data or scanner data, which are very large in volume and need special processing techniques. In this paper, we address one of the main problems in the consumer price index calculation, namely the product classification, which cannot be performed manually when using large data sources. Therefore, we conducted an experiment on automatic product classification …
