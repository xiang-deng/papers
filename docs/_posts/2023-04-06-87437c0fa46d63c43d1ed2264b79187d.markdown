Recently, source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) has emerged as a more practical and feasible approach compared to unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) which assumes that labeled source data are always accessible. However, significant limitations associated with SFUDA approaches are often overlooked, which limits their practicality in real-world applications. These limitations include a lack of principled ways to determine optimal hyperparameters and performance  Cites: Fine-tuning can distort pretrained features and underperform out-of
