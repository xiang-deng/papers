The ellipsis of the syntactic structure is a common phenomenon in ordinary textual documents. Existing studies have found that despite syntactic ellipsis could help avoid repetition of normative documents, it could also, for example, lead to ambiguity and hamper the understandability of document contents. As a fundamental component of software, code comments are generally written by developers in a non-structured way just like normative documents.
