Obtaining a standardized benchmark of computational methods is a major issue in data-science communities.

Here, we introduce Codabench, a meta-benchmark platform that is open sourced and community driven for benchmarking algorithms or software agents versus datasets or tasks. A public instance of Codabench is open to everyone free of charge and allows benchmark organizers to Cites: Molecular geometry prediction using a deep generative graph
