Abstract Analysis and design, as the most critical components in material science, require a highly rigorous approach to assure long-term success. Due to a recent increase in the amount of available experimental data, large databases now contain a depth of knowledge on important properties of materials. The use of this information, combined with Machine Learning (ML) solutions, can enhance the materials manufacturing process and efficiency. Indeed, ML can predict material Cites: Wilds: A benchmark of in-the-wild distribution shifts
