The rapid assessment of building damage in earthquake-stricken areas is of paramount importance for emergency response. The development of remote sensing technology has aided in deriving reliable and precise building damage assessments of extensive areas following disasters. It is well documented that convolutional neural network methods have superior performance in earthquake building damage assessment compared with traditional machine learning methods. However, deep Cites: Understanding black-box predictions via influence functions
