Many real-world networks are suitable to be modeled as heterogeneous graphs, which are made up of many sorts of nodes and links. When the heterogeneous map is a non-attribute graph or some features on the graph are missing, it will lead to poor performance of the previous models. In this paper, we hold that useful position features can be generated through the guidance of topological information on the graph and present a generic framework for Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks …
