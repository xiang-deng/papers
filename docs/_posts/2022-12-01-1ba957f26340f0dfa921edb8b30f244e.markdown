Unintended memorization of various information granularity has garnered academic attention in recent years, eg membership inference and property inference. How to inversely use this privacy leakage to facilitate real-world applications is a growing direction; the current efforts include dataset ownership inference and user auditing. Standing on the data lifecycle and ML model production, we propose an inference process named Data Provenance Inference, which is to infer the generation  Cites: Well-read students learn better: On the importance of pre-training
