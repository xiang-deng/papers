The extraction of buildings from remote sensing images is a challenging task. However, existing methods are insufficiently accurate because of the diverse types of buildings, large-scale variability, and complex backgrounds in remote sensing images. There are many deficiencies of the extraction results, such as small building omission, building internal discontinuity, blurred boundary, and irregular building appearance extraction. To solve these problems, a global feature capture and cross …
