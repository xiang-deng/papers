Over the last several years, the impact of Artificial Intelligence on the world and on society has been undeniable. More specifically, a subfield, known as Machine Learning (ML), is driving innovation in a vast variety of fields as it denotes the ability of a machine to identify relationships between data without explicit criteria, emulating a human-like type of learning. Over the last decade, research efforts have also been focused on orthopedics in order to provide help and assistance to surgeons and  Cites: Prediction of total knee replacement and diagnosis of osteoarthritis
