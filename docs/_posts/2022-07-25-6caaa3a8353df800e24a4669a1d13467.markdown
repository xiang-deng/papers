This paper investigates logical foundations of the derivation of literals from non-Horn knowledge bases with fuzzy predicates. Some of the predicates are defined by neural networks, and some are defined by recursive functions. This inference excludes reasoning by contradiction, and it is characterized by means of substructural singlesuccedent sequent calculi with non-logical axioms expressing knowledge base rules and facts. The semantics of this inference is specified by  Cites: Neural logic machines
