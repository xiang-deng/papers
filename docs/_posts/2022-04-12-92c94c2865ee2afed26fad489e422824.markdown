The building energy performance certificates (EPC) are widely adopted for sustainable development and improvement in building energy efficiency. Different from the conventional direct measurement based approach of acquiring a building s EPC label, this study proposes a novel and alternative approach to classify a building s EPC label using artificial neural network (ANN) models. Given the extensive best building EPC practices in developed countries, historical building Cites:   Why Should I Trust You? : Explaining the Predictions of Any
