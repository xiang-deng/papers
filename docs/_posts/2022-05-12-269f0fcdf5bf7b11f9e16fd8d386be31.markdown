Ocular disease is an eye disease that reduces the eye s ability to work normally. Early ocular disease detection is important to avoid blindness caused by some of the diseases like cataracts, glaucoma, diabetes, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), etc. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been used to build systems for the speedy diagnosis of such diseases. In recent years, the deep neural network (DNN) has shown remarkable success in this area. But the black box nature of such Cites: Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations
