Learning to detect automatic anomalies in production plants remains a machine learning challenge. Since anomalies by definition cannot be learned, their detection must rely on a very accurate  normality model . To this aim, we introduce here a global-to-local Gaussian model for neural network features, learned from a set of normal images. This probabilistic model enables unsupervised anomaly detection. A global Gaussian mixture model of the features is first learned using all available …
