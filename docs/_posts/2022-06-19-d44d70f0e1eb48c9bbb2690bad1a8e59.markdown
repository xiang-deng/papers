Transformer is a promising neural network learner, and has achieved great success in various machine learning tasks. Thanks to the recent prevalence of multimodal applications and big data, Transformer-based multimodal learning has become a hot topic in AI research. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of Transformer techniques oriented at multimodal data. The main contents of this survey include:(1) a background of multimodal learning, Transformer ecosystem, and the multimodal Cites: Graphcodebert: Pre-training code representations with data flow
