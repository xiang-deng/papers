Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is an important part in task-oriented dialog system, whose target is to infer the current dialog states and user intentions according to the dialog history information. To this end, we have achieved improvements to the existing work and proposed a dynamic network model suitable for multi-domain dialog, which can explicitly use domain information and better cope with zero-shot tasks. The model is composed of three modules: an encoder, a decoder and a slot  Cites: Transferable multi-domain state generator for task-oriented
