Misinformation refers to inaccurate information created to misguide the readers. It spreads on social platforms like Twitter with various presentations such as fake news and rumors that usually contain numbers, categorical information, texts, images, etc., which has become a global issue of cybersecurity. We propose a semi-supervised deep model based on bidirectional recurrent neural networks (Bi-RNN) to detect misinformation with limited labeled data and large unlabeled data. The proposed  Cites: CED: Credible early detection of social media rumors
