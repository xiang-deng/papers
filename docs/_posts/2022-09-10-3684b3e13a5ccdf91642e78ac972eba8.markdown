Deep neural networks have superior transferability between different tasks. However, attackers may inject a backdoor into the pre-trained network to indirectly inject the backdoor into the user s new network which is transferred from the pre-trained network. The previous backdoor attack schemes cannot ensure that the backdoor in the pre-trained network will not be damaged during network transfer. To deal with this issue, we propose a universal robust backdoor attack scheme to injecting the  Cites: Weight Poisoning Attacks on Pre-trained Models
