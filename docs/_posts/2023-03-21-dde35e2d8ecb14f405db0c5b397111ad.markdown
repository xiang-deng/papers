Active Learning (AL) and Semi-supervised Learning are two techniques that have been studied to reduce the high cost of deep learning by using a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. To improve the accuracy of models at a lower cost, we propose a method called Active Semi-supervised Learning (ASSL), which combines AL and SSL. To maximize the synergy between AL and SSL, we focused on the differences between ASSL and AL. ASSL involves  Cites: Margin-based active learning for structured output spaces
