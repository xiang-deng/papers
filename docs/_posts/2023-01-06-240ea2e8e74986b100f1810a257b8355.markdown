Multi-view clustering divides data into their under-lying partitions by exploiting multiple views information. Popular approaches leverage cross-view information by self-expressive tensor learning and then learn a low-rank or sparse essential representation tensor for capturing the global structure of multi-view data. However, this process may encounter instability due to the lack of protection for local within-view structures. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a unified L ow-rank Cites: Learning with hypergraphs: Clustering, classification, and
