Humans perceive the world in terms of objects and relations between them. In fact, for any given pair of objects, there is a myriad of relations that apply to them.

And how can it use these representations to build a relational policy to interact effectively with the environment? In this paper we proposed that this problem can be understood through the lens of a sub-field of symbolic machine learning called Cites: Neural logic machines
