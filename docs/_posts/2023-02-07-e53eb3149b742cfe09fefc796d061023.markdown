Given a sentence Abby told Brittney that she upset Courtney , one would struggle to understand who she refers to, and ask for clarification. However, if the word upset were replaced with hugged , she unambiguously refers to Abby. We study if modern coreference resolution models are sensitive to such pronominal ambiguity. To this end, we construct AmbiCoref, a diagnostic corpus of minimal sentence pairs with ambiguous and unambiguous referents. Our examples generalize Cites: Calibration of Pre-trained Transformers
