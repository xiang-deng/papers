Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is a task to transform the symbolic entities and relations in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into lowdimensional vectors, which facilitates the use of KGs in downstream applications. However, most existing models ignore the semantic correlations among similar entities and relations. Indeed, we find there exist semantically similarities in entities or relations. To take advantage of these semantic correlations, we utilize the entity cluster and relation cluster information to …
