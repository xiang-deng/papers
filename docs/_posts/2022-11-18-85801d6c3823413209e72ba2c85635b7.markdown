Open domain question answering (ODQA) is a longstanding task aimed at answering factual questions from a large knowledge corpus without any explicit evidence in natural language processing (NLP). Recent works have predominantly focused on improving the answering accuracy and achieved promising progress. However, higher accuracy often comes with more memory consumption and inference latency, which might not necessarily be efficient enough for direct  Cites: Retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive nlp tasks
