Neural network language models can serve as computational hypotheses about how humans process language. We compared the model-human consistency of diverse language models using a novel experimental approach: controversial sentence pairs. For each controversial sentence pair, two language models disagree about which sentence is more likely to occur in natural text. Considering nine language models (including n-gram, recurrent neural networks, and transformer models), we Cites: Semantically Equivalent Adversarial Rules for Debugging NLP
