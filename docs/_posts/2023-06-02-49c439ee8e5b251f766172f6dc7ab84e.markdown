The advents of Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in augmenting programming using natural interactions. However, while LLMs are proficient in compiling common usage patterns into a programming language, eg, Python, it remains a challenge how to edit and debug an LLM-generated program. We introduce ANPL, a programming system that allows users to decompose user-specific tasks. In an ANPL program, a user can directly manipulate sketch, which Cites: Building a semantic parser overnight
