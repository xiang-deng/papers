Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to transfer the knowledge learned from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain, thereby improving the classification performance of the target domain. Recent methods use contrastive learning to optimize this task, however, these methods only focus on contrastive learning for aspects of domain alignment, which do not actively serve the classification task, resulting in suboptimal solution. To this end, we propose Task  Cites: Connect, not collapse: Explaining contrastive learning for
