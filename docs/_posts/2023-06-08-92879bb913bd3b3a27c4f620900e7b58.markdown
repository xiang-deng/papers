Malicious server (MS) attacks have enabled the scaling of data stealing in federated learning to large batch sizes and secure aggregation, settings previously considered private. However, many concerns regarding client-side detectability of MS attacks were raised, questioning their practicality once they are publicly known. In this work, for the first time, we thoroughly study the problem of client-side detectability. We demonstrate that most prior MS attacks, which fundamentally rely on one of two key  Cites: Recovering Private Text in Federated Learning of Language Models
