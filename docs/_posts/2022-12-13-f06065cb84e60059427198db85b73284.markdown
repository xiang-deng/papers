Multivariate time-series classification problems are found in many industrial settings; for example, fault detection in a manufacturing process by monitoring sensors signals. It is difficult to obtain large labeled datasets in these settings, for reasons such as limitations in the automatic recording, the need for expert root-cause analysis, and the very limited access to human experts. Therefore, methods that perform classification in a label efficient manner are useful for building and deploying Cites: Cold-start active learning through self-supervised language
