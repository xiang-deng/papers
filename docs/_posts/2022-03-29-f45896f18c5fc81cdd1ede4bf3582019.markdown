Comparing with natural imaging datasets used in transfer learning, the effects of medical pre-training datasets are underexplored. In this study, we carry out transfer learning pre-training dataset effect analysis in breast cancer imaging by evaluating three popular deep neural networks and one patch-based convolutional neural network on three target datasets under different fine-tuning configurations. Through a series of comparisons, we conclude that the pre-training dataset, DDSM, is effective Cites: Evaluation of combined artificial intelligence and radiologist
