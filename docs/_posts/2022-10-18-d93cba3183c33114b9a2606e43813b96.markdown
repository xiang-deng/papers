Smart manufacturing needs digital clones of physical objects (digital twins) and human decision-makers (cognitive clones). The latter requires use of machine learning to capture hidden personalised decision models from humans. Machine learning nowadays is a subject of various adversarial attacks (poisoning, evasion, etc.). Responsible use of machine learning requires digital immunity (the capability of smart systems to operate robustly in adversarial conditions). Both problems (clones …
