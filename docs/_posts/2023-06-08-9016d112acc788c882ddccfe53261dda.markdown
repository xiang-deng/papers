Mathematical reasoning is regarded as a necessary ability for Language Models (LMs). Recent works demonstrate large LMs impressive performance in solving math problems. The success is attributed to their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning abilities, ie, the ability to decompose complex questions into step-by-step reasoning chains, but such ability seems only to emerge from models with abundant parameters. This work investigates how to incorporate relatively small LMs with the  Cites: Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways
