Languages vary considerably in syntactic structure. About 40% of the world s languages have subject–verb–object order, and about 40% have subject–object–verb order. Extensive work has sought to explain this word order variation across languages. However, the existing approaches are not able to explain coherently the frequency distribution and evolution of word order in individual languages. We propose that variation in word order reflects different ways of balancing competing …
